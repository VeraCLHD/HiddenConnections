Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the developed world. NAFLD is tightly linked to insulin resistance and considered to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. The cornerstone of any treatment regimen for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle modification focused on weight loss, exercise, and improving insulin sensitivity. Here we review the literature and discuss the role of diet and nutrient composition in the management of NAFLD. Because there are currently no specific dietary guidelines for NAFLD, this review proposes a dietary framework for patients with NAFLD based on the available evidence and extrapolates from dietary guidelines aimed at reducing insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk.
