Abstract The response of a patient with histologically proven reticulum cell sarcoma to no treatment other than large doses of ascorbic acid is described. At the time of first diagnosis, the disease was widely disseminated, and a very dramatic regression of all parameters of disease activity was induced by the continuous administration of large doses of ascorbic acid. Reduction in dosage some months later coincided with reactivation of the disease process. The reinstitution of regular high-dose ascorbic acid therapy induced a second complete remission. The case report is illustrated by serial radiographs. The significance of the therapeutic response is briefly discussed in relation to general schemes of cancer management.
