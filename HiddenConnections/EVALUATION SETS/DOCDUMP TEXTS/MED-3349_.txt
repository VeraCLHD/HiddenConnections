Abstract The effects of vegetables in mixed meals on satiety were evaluated by varying the dose (portions 150 and 250 g containing 4.3 and 7.2 g of dietary fibre, respectively) and structure (cut and minced) of microwaved spinach. A control meal without spinach and the test meals with spinach were balanced regarding energy (2000 kJ) and digestible carbohydrates (59 g, 51 E%) and with protein and fat as far as possible similar. The meals were served in the morning, after an overnight fast, to ten healthy male volunteers. Satiety was registered and blood glucose as well as plasma insulin and C-peptide were analysed at regular intervals until 3.5 h postprandially. The largest spinach portions augmented satiety and reduced the postprandial glucose response. The total satiety scores seemed to be correlated positively to both the dietary fibre and the water content in the vegetable. Differences in structure had no influence on satiety scores.
