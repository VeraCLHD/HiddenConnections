Abstract Peripheral nerve oxygen tensions were assessed in vivo by using microelectrodes to measure endoneurial oxygen tension in exposed sural nerve. In 11 diabetic patients with chronic sensorimotor neuropathy the mean endoneurial oxygen tension was 39.7 (SD 10.2) mm Hg. In all but one patient compared with none of four non-neuropathic subjects the mean nerve oxygen tensions were below dorsal foot vein values. This unphysiological state may have a role in the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy.
