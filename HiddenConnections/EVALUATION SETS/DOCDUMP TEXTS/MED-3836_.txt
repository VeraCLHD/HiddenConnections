Abstract BACKGROUND: We aimed to clarify the lifestyle factors associated with erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) in a Japanese population. METHODS: Among 886 subjects who underwent health screening, we selected, according to their scores on the FSSG (frequency scale for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease; GERD) questionnaire and the findings of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 138 subjects with erosive esophagitis (EE), 148 subjects with NERD (absence of esophagitis, FSSG score ≥8, and acid reflux-related symptoms score ≥4), and 565 control subjects (absence of esophagitis and FSSG score ≤7). We compared clinical characteristics and various lifestyle factors in these three groups. RESULTS: The lifestyle factors significantly associated with NERD compared with findings in the control group were intake of egg (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.50), sleep shortage (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.54-3.88), and strong psychological stress (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.18-2.62). In male subjects, current smoking (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.13-3.74; OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.09-3.20) was a significant risk factor for both NERD and EE. Moreover, alcohol >200 kcal/day (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.03-15.55) and intake of a large quantity of food at supper (OR 7.85, 95% CI 1.66-37.05) were significant risk factors for EE in subjects with hiatal hernia. Intake of a large quantity of food at supper (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.06-4.13) was more common in the NERD group than in the EE group. CONCLUSIONS: There were differences in the associated lifestyle factors between patients with NERD and those with EE, and there was also a gender-related difference between these groups.
