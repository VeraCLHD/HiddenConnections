Abstract Context Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for over half of all cardiac deaths, and the majority occur as the first manifestation of heart disease, especially among women. Primary preventive strategies are needed to reduce SCD incidence. Objective To estimate the degree to which adherence to a healthy lifestyle may lower risk of SCD among women. Design, setting and participants We conducted a prospective cohort study among 81,722 US women from the Nurses' Health Study, from June 1984 to June 2010. Lifestyle factors were assessed via questionnaires every 2-4 years. A low-risk lifestyle was defined as not smoking, BMI <25 kg/m2, exercise â‰¥30 minutes/day, and top 40% of the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score, which emphasizes high intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish and moderate intake of alcohol. Main Outcome Measure SCD defined as death occurring within 1 hour of symptom onset without evidence of circulatory collapse. Results We documented 321 cases of SCD over 26 years. All 4 low-risk lifestyle factors were significantly and independently associated with lower risk of SCD. The absolute risks of SCD were 22, 17, 18, 13 and 16 cases/100,000 person-years among women with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 low-risk factors, respectively. Compared to women with 0 low-risk factors, the multivariate relative risk of SCD was 0.54 (95%CI: 0.34, 0.86), 0.41 (95%CI: 0.25, 0.65), 0.33 (95%CI: 0.20, 0.54) and 0.08 (95%CI: 0.03, 0.23) for women with 1, 2, 3, and 4 low-risk factors, respectively. The proportion of SCD attributable to smoking, inactivity, overweight, and poor diet was 81% (95%CI: 52%, 93%). Among women without clinically diagnosed CHD, the PAR% was 79% (95%CI: 40%, 93%). Conclusions Adherence to a low-risk lifestyle is associated with a low risk of SCD and may be an effective strategy for the prevention of SCD in the general population.
