Abstract The global diffusion of the so-called Western diet, which is enriched in fat and carbohydrates, such as fructose, has been proposed to be an underlying cause of the increased prevalence of metabolic conditions, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This Smart Card summarizes the main metabolic and hepatic histological features of rodent models fed with diets combining high fat and fructose.
