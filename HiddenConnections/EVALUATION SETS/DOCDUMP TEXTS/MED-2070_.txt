Abstract Two estrogenic substances of plant origin have been identified in beer using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. These phytoestrogens, daidzein and genistein, have previously been shown to be biologically active in animals. Confirming the presence of biologically active phytoestrogens in beer and their possible presence in other beverages, suggests that there may be clinically significant effects related to sustained exposure to phytoestrogens contained in alcoholic beverages.
