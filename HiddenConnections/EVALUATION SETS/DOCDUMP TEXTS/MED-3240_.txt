Abstract High blood pressure is the leading cause of premature mortality worldwide. Reducing salt intake lowers blood pressure and blood pressure-lowering reduces vascular disease. There is a very high likelihood that reducing dietary salt intake will prevent vascular disease and no evidence to suggest it will cause harm. With average population salt consumption levels typically 5-10 times greater than physiological requirements, even moderately effective community-wide salt reduction programs offer the potential for very large health gains. This opportunity has been recognized and adopted by the World Health Organization as a priority action to combat chronic diseases. Copyright Â© 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.
