Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between fruit/vegetable consumption and erectile dysfunction (ED) among Canadian men with diabetes. METHODS: Data from the 2011 Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada - Diabetes Component were analyzed using Statistical Analysis System Enterprise Guide (SAS EG). Respondents were asked a series questions related to their sociodemographics, lifestyle, and chronic health conditions. The association between fruit/vegetable consumption and ED was examined using logistic regression after controlling for potential confounding factors. Bootstrap procedure was used to estimate sample distribution and calculate confidence intervals. RESULTS: Overall, 26.2% of respondents reported having ED. The prevalence increased with age and duration of diabetes. Compared with respondents without ED, those with ED were more likely to be obese, smokers, physically inactive, and either divorced, widowed, or separated. Diabetes complications such as nerve damage, circulation problems, and kidney failure or kidney disease were also significantly associated with ED. After controlling for potential confounding factors, a 10% risk reduction of ED was found with each additional daily serving of fruit/vegetable consumed. CONCLUSION: ED is common among Canadian men with diabetes. ED was highly associated with age, duration of diabetes, obesity, smoking, and the presence of other diabetes-related complications. Fruit and vegetable consumption might have a protective effect against ED. Crown Copyright Â© 2013. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
