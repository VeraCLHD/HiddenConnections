Abstract 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) and 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (2-Me-TQ) were identified for the first time by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the parkinsonian and normal human brains. TIQ, an analogue of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), was markedly increased in the parkinsonian brain and could be an endogenous neurotoxin to induce Parkinson's disease.
