Abstract Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women in the United States. One of the known risk factors of breast cancer is obesity. Leptin is a product of the obese (ob) gene and plays an important role in breast cancer development. Its expression is up-regulated in obesity and it promotes breast cancer cell growth. Exposure to environmental estrogenic disruptors has been found to be directly related to the increase in the incidence of breast cancer. Zeranol (Z) is a non-steroidal anabolic growth promoter with potent estrogenic activity that is widely used in the US beef industry. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of Z- and leptin-induced proliferation of primary cultured human breast cancer epithelial cells (HBCECs). A cell proliferation assay was used to determine the extent to which Z is capable of enhancing the mitogenic activity of leptin in HBCECs. RT-PCR was used to explore the possible mechanisms by quantifying the transcription of cyclin D1 and ObR genes. Our results demonstrated that when the HBCECs were pre-treated with 3 nM leptin for 24 h, the sensitivity to Z exposure greatly enhanced the mitogenic action of leptin. The experimental data observed show that there is interaction between leptin and Z in HBCEC growth.
