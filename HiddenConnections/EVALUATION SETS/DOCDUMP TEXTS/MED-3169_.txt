Abstract As a species we humans are outnumbered by bacteria in both cell and gene count. This somewhat humbling observation is key to the increasing recognition that the long-standing symbiotic and commensal relations between Homo sapiens and bacteria are of great significance to basic human physiology and health. Knowledge of our human bacterial environment is contributing to an understanding of a variety of disorders including obesity and metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, immunity, and neuronal development and behavior. The Human Microbiome Project is providing a genetic and ecological analysis and will serve as a parallel to the Human Genome Project. Exploration of the chemical space utilized by bacteria will contribute to the development of new small molecule therapeutic agents, including new antibiotics. And genetically re-engineered bacteria are proving to be of potential value as actual therapeutic entities. Our understanding of our bacterial world has the capability to transform radically our current approach to human health diverting it from an emphasis on acute treatments to living in healthy harmony with both our internal and external environments.
