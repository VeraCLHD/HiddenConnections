Abstract Cancer and cardiovascular disease are still the number one and two killer diseases in most developed countries. There is justified hope that beta-carotene will be proven efficacious in the prevention and/or delaying of the onset of these chronic diseases. Chronic disease prevention through better nutrition, judicious use of supplements and better lifestyles will assume added importance in the coming years as the proportion of the population over 65 years increases.
