Abstract Objective To estimate the prevalence of suicide risk (SR) and major depressive episode (MDE) in early pregnancy, and the relationship of fatty acids serum status to these outcomes. Method Cross-sectional analyses of 234 pregnant women enrolled in a prospective cohort study in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil were performed. SR and MDE were defined according to MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Fatty acids compositions were determined in serum samples obtained between the 6th and 13th gestational week. Statistical analyses included univariate and multiple logistic regressions. Fatty acids data were expressed both as percent of total fatty acids and converted to Z scores then entered as continuous variable into regression models. Results The prevalence of SR was 19.6% and MDE was 17.0%. Higher likelihood of SR was observed among women with higher arachidonic acid [AA (20:4n-6): OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.07] and adrenic acid [AdA (22:4 n-6): OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.01-2.04], and for MDE: AA [OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.10], and AdA [OR=1.59, 95% CI 1.09-2.32], per standard deviation of fatty acid, in adjusted logistic regressions. Conclusion Higher serum status of AA and AdA, two omega-6 fatty acids, were associated with greater likelihood of SR and MDE among pregnant Brazilian women independently of confounding variables.
