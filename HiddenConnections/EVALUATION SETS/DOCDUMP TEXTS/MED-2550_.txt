Abstract Background Parkinson disease is inversely associated with cigarette smoking, but its relation with passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke exposure is rarely examined. Methods Within a case-control study we assessed the association between Parkinson disease and living or working with active smokers. Cases were newly diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease (N=154) from western Washington State in 2002–2008. Age- and sex-matched controls (N=173) were neurologically normal and unrelated to cases. Results Compared with never active or passive tobacco smokers, we observed similarly reduced Parkinson disease risks for ever passive smokers only (odds ratio=0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.16–0.73) as for ever active smokers (0.35, 0.17–0.73). Among persons whose only tobacco smoke exposure was passive smoking at home, risk was inversely associated with years exposed. Conclusion These observations parallel those well-established for active smoking. However, it remains unresolved whether a true protective effect of tobacco smoke, generally detrimental to health, underlies these associations.
