Abstract OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Hop on early menopausal symptoms and hot flashes. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 women were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving the Hop or placebo tablets for 12 weeks. Early menopausal symptoms were assessed using Greene scale and hot flashes were recorded in a diary before, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after intervention. RESULTS: The mean Greene score was significantly lower in the Hop group than the placebo group at the end of weeks 4 (adjusted difference: -10.0, 95% confidence interval: -11.1--8.9), 8 (-18.6, -20.1--17.1) and 12 (-23.4, -25.1--21.6). The number of hot flashes was significantly lower in the Hop group than the control group during the weeks 4 (-8.4, -9.8--7.1), 8 (-17.1, -14.9--19.3) and 12 (-23.8, -21.1--26.4). CONCLUSIONS: Hop effectively reduced the early menopausal symptoms. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was approved (code 91209) by the Ethic Committee of Tabriz university of Medical Sciences and registered at the Iranian registry of clinical trials, with IRCT 2013010110324N7 on April 2013.
