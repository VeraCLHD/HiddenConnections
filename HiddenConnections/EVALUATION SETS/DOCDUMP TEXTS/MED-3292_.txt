Abstract Based on many experimental and observational studies we now understand that neurodegenerative brain changes begin by middle age. Characteristics of the risk factors for these brain changes may also change with age. A review is conducted of studies that report on the association of mid-life risk factors to late cognitive impairment and dementia. Issues related to the interpretation of the data are discussed. The studies suggest that mid-life cardiovascular risk factors, and in particular elevated levels of blood pressure, increase the risk for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia. Our understanding the contribution of cardiovascular risk factors to late age brain disease has been helped tremendously by prospective studies with long follow-up. To better understand which risk factors lead to disease initiation, progression and prognosis, a life course approach to the epidemiologic study of dementia is needed.
