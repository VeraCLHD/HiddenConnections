Abstract In this study, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association of major dietary patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia taking account of blood lipids in Chinese adults. 187 cases with confirmed asymptomatic hyperuricemia and 187 controls were frequency matched on age, gender and area of residence. We conducted factor analysis using dietary information from a validated food frequency questionnaire to derive dietary patterns. The association between major dietary patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Three major dietary patterns were found: 1) "animal products and fried food," 2) "western," 3) "soybean products and fruit." In multivariate analyses the "animal products and fried food" pattern score was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.15 (95% CI, 1.22-3.76) compared with the lowest tertile. The OR for the top tertile of score for "soybean products and fruit" pattern was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19-0.57) compared with the lowest tertile of "soybean products and fruit" pattern score. The significant association of these two patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia persisted after further adjusting for blood lipids. On the other hand, the "western" pattern was not associated with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. We observed a positive relationship between the "animal products and fried food" pattern and asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and a negative relationship between the "soybean products and fruit" pattern and asymptomatic hyperuricemia, independent of blood lipids.
