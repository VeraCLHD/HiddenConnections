Abstract Fifty-one families of patients affected with Huntington's chorea were interviewed with respect to age at onset, symptoms at onset and course of the disease. The interview further comprised questions pertinent to line of transmission, socio-economic status, housing, previous illnesses and pregnancy and stillbirth. Since the study was set up as a fishing expedition detailed quantitative information was gathered on many life-style factors including eating, drinking and smoking habits. In adult age onset cases earlier age at onset correlated with lower rate of progression. Line of transmission was of no influence on age at onset in cases with onset above 20 years. No statistically significant relationship was found between any factor studied and age at onset, except for the intake of milk. Higher previous milk intake was associated with earlier ages at onset. This finding is critically discussed. No difference was found between the respective ages at onset of conduct disorders and affective disorders. This suggests that they are both associated with the Huntington gene.
