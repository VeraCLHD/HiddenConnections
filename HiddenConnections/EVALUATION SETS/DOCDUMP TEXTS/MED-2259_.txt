Abstract INTRODUCTION: Altered perception of orgasm, orgasm-associated pain, penile sensory changes, urinary incontinence (UI) during sexual activity, penile shortening (PS), and penile deformity following radical prostatectomy (RP) have received increasing attention from researchers. AIM: The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence and predictors of the above-mentioned side effects. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study among men who had undergone RP between 3 and 36 months prior to study inclusion. Predicting factors were identified through logistic regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were prevalence rates of the above-mentioned side effects. RESULTS: Overall, 316 questionnaires were available for analyses. Of the sexually active patients (n = 256), 12 (5%) reported anorgasmia, whereas 153 (60%) reported decreased orgasm intensity. Delayed orgasms were reported by 146 (57%). Twenty-three patients (10%) had experienced pain during orgasm. UI during sexual activity were reported by 99 patients (38%). Out of the whole population, 77 patients (25%) reported sensory changes in the penis. A total of 143 patients (47%) reported a subjective loss of penile length of >1 cm. An altered curvature of the penis was reported by 30 patients (10%). Patients had increasing risk of UI during sexual activity (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.25) and orgasmic dysfunction (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.16) with increasing International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire scores. Erectile dysfunction (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.07-3.10) and a high body mass index (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19) increased the risk of PS after RP. Nerve-sparing (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.16-0.95) reduced the risk of PS. CONCLUSIONS: Orgasm-associated problems, UI during sexual activity, penile sensory changes, PS, and penile deformity are common side effects to RP. Daytime UI, erectile dysfunction, and nerve-sparing status can help identify patients at risk. © 2014 International Society for Sexual Medicine.
