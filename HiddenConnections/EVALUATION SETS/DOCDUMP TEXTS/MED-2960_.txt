Abstract Oxalate nephropathy is a rare condition characterized by extensive calcium oxalate deposition in the renal tubules, resulting in kidney injury. There are primary forms of the disease that arise from genetic mutation causing overproduction of oxalate. More commonly, this condition is seen as a secondary phenomenon. The clinical presentation is nonspecific, with acute kidney injury and normal serologic study results. The characteristic finding on kidney biopsy is the presence of acute tubular injury associated with polarizable crystals in the tubular lumen and epithelial cytoplasm. We present a case of acute oxalate nephropathy in a patient with underlying systemic lupus erythematosus who recently received intravenous vitamin C.
