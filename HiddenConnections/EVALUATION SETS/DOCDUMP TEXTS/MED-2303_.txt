Abstract BACKGROUND & AIM: Recent studies suggest that white rice consumption increases risk of diabetes. AIM: to assess the association between white rice intake and the incidence of diabetes in a population from Southern Spain. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was undertaken in Pizarra, Spain. At baseline and follow-up, participants underwent an interview and a standardized clinical examination which included an oral glucose tolerance test in those subjects without known diabetes. Incidence and odds ratio (OR) for diabetes were calculated. Multivariate analysis was performed using stepwise logistical regression. RESULTS: Thirty eight percent of subjects reported rice consumption 2-3 times a week, 58.5% once or less a week, and 3.6% no rice consumption. In subjects who reported rice intake 2-3 times a week, incidence of diabetes after 6 years follow-up was 12.0%, and in those who reported once or less a week, 20.2% (p = 0.04, non adjusted). Subjects who ate rice frequently had lower risk to develop diabetes 6 years later (OR = 0.43, p = 0.04; adjusted for age, sex, obesity, and presence of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline). CONCLUSIONS: A negative association was found between white rice intake in the way it is consumed in Southern Spain, and the 6 years incidence of diabetes.
