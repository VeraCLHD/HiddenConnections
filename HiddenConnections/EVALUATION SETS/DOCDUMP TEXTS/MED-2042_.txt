Abstract Objective To compare total fruit and vegetable intake in cup equivalents (FVC) and its individual components among Hispanic subgroups in California. Methods Data are from the adult portion of the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. Hispanic/Latino subjects (n = 7954) were grouped into six subcategories (Mexican, Central American, Caribbean, Spanish American, South American, > 1 group). FVC was estimated from frequency responses about seven food categories. T-test and chi-squares were estimated to assess differences in sociodemographic characteristics across Hispanic subgroups. Multivariate linear regressions using SUDAAN were conducted to obtain means of FVC and its components by Hispanic subgroups controlling for confounders. Results Hispanic subgroups did not differ in their intake of total FVC (mean cups = 3.4 and 2.9 for men and women, respectively). Small but significant differences (p<0.01) were found across Hispanic subgroups in individual FVC components (green salad (women only), cooked dried beans and non-fried white potatoes) after adjusting for potential sociodemographic and acculturation confounders. Conclusion Hispanic FVC intake did not meet the national recommendation, although their reported intake is higher compared to other race/ethnicity groups. The public health message remains the same: to increase FVC. Examination of intake for subgroups of Hispanics may enhance the utility of dietary information for surveillance, program and message design, and intervention and evaluation.
