Abstract Objectives Ginger is one of the most commonly used herbal medicine for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) but no data exists about its effectiveness. Design Double blind randomized controlled trial Setting University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill North Carolina, USA Intervention Forty-five IBS patients were randomly assigned to three groups: placebo, one gram of ginger, and two grams of ginger daily for 28 days. Main outcome measures The IBS severity scale (IBS-SS) was administered, as well as adequate relief of symptoms scale. A responder was defined as having at least 25% reduction in IBS-SS post-treatment. Results There were 57.1% responders to placebo, 46.7% to one gram and 33.3% to two grams of ginger. Adequate relief was reported by 53.3% on placebo and 53.3% in both ginger groups combined. Side effects were mild and reported by 35.7% in the placebo and 16.7% in the ginger groups. Conclusions This double blind randomized controlled pilot study suggests ginger is well tolerated but did not perform better than placebo. Larger trials are needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.
