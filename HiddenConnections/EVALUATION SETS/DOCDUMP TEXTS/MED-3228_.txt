Abstract Cholesterol is highly enriched in the brain compared to other tissues. Essentially all cholesterol in the brain is synthesized endogenously since plasma lipoproteins are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Cholesterol is transported within the central nervous system in the form of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoprotein particles that are secreted mainly by glial cells. Cholesterol is excreted from the brain in the form of 24-hydroxycholesterol. Apolipoprotein E and cholesterol have been implicated in the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the progressive neurodegenerative disorder Niemann-Pick C disease is characterized by defects in intracellular trafficking of cholesterol.
