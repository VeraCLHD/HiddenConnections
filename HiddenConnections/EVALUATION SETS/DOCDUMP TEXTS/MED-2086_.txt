Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is unclear if a modest reduction in dietary salt intake has beneficial effects on vascular function. The aim was to compare the effects of 9 g salt/day with 6 g salt/day intake on measures of vascular function and explore mechanisms of effect in overweight and obese adults. METHODS: Twenty-five overweight/obese subjects (BMI 27-40 kg/m(2)) completed a randomised cross-over study of 6 weeks each on a reduced salt (RS) (6 g/day) and usual salt diet (US) (9 g/day). Flow-mediated-dilatation (FMD), 24 h blood pressure (BP), augmentation index (AIx), pulse wave velocity (PWV), plasma and urinary nitrate/nitrite, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 and vascular adhesion molecules were measured after 2 days and 6 weeks. Adherence to the diets was determined from two 24 h urine collections. RESULTS: Urinary sodium excretion was 155 ± 58 mmol/24 h US vs 113 ± 45 mmol/24 h RS (p = 0.002). Following the RS diet there was a significant improvement in FMD from 3.5 ± 2.8% to 5.6 ± 2.8% (P < 0.001) and decrease in serum endothelin-1 from 1.45 ± 0.38 pg/ml to 1.25 ± 0.39 pg/ml (P < 0.05). Endothelium-independent vasodilatation was also significantly different between treatments (P < 0.05). AIx, PWV, serum ADMA and plasma and urinary nitrate/nitrite concentrations were not different between treatments. Change in FMD was related to the urinary sodium: creatinine ratio (r = -0.47, P < 0.05) and was independent of blood pressure. Aldosterone and renin were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: A small reduction in dietary salt intake of 3 g/day improves endothelial function in normotensive overweight and obese subjects. This response may be mediated by serum endothelin-1. This small reduction in salt had no effect on aldosterone and renin concentrations.
