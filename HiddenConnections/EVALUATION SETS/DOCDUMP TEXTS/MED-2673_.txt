Abstract In summary, then, there is an accumulating body of clinical human data supporting the concept that lipid nephrotoxicity may be important in the initiation of renal injury, and that lipids play a synergistic role in the inexorable process of progression to end-stage renal disease in nondiabetic as well as diabetic chronic renal disease. Further clarification of the role of lipid nephrotoxicity and impact of therapeutic interventions await data from larger prospective studies aimed at this specific question.
