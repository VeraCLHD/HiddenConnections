Abstract Although recent epidemiological studies found a positive correlation between dietary vitamin C intake and bone mineral density, data on plasma levels of vitamin C or other antioxidants in osteoporotic subjects are scanty. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether antioxidant defenses are decreased in elderly osteoporotic women and, if this is the case, to understand whether osteoporosis is a condition characterized by increased oxidative stress. To answer these questions, plasma vitamins C, E, and A; uric acid; and the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase in plasma and erythrocytes and of glutathione peroxidase in plasma were measured in 75 subjects with osteoporosis and 75 controls. Dietary and endogenous antioxidants were consistently lower in osteoporotic than in control subjects. On the other hand, plasma levels of malondialdehyde, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, did not differ between groups. Our results reveal that antioxidant defenses are markedly decreased in osteoporotic women. The mechanisms underlying antioxidant depletion and its relevance to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis deserve further investigation.
