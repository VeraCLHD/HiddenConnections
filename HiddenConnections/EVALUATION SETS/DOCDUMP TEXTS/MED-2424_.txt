Abstract The possible relation between child's early diet and risk of childhood leukemia has remained largely unexplored. The authors' objective was to determine what particular foods consumed early in life (first 2 years) are associated with risk of childhood leukemia in a 1995-2002 case-control study of a diverse California population. Dietary data were obtained from a questionnaire administered to the child's caregiver. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze 328 case-control sets matched on age, sex, Hispanic status, and maternal race. Regular consumption of oranges/bananas (odds ratio = 0.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.94) and orange juice (odds ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.94) during the first 2 years of life was associated with a reduction in risk of childhood leukemia diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 14 years. Restricting the analysis to leukemia diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 5 years reflected a similar pattern of reduced risk. No association between eating hot dogs/lunch meats and risk of leukemia was found. These results suggest that fruits or fruit juices that contain vitamin C and/or potassium may reduce the risk of childhood leukemia, especially if they are consumed on a regular basis during the first 2 years of life.
