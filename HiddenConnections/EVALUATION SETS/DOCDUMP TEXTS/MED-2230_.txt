Abstract Clinical trials were designed to validate the protective effect of beta-carotene in populations of cigarette smokers at high risk for lung cancer development. Strikingly, an increase in lung cancer resulted following beta-carotene supplementation in two separate studies in Finland and the United States. These trials were conducted without any evidence that beta-carotene prevents lung cancer in animal models.
