Abstract Lead, an environmental contaminant, originates from a variety of sources. For over two decades, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made a number of efforts to reduce dietary lead exposure of the general population, and especially of vulnerable subpopulations such as infants and children and, indirectly, the foetus. Through cooperation with infant food manufacturers, reductions of about 80-90% in the lead content of infant foods were achieved, primarily through eliminating the use of cans for infant food products and following good manufacturing practices. Another major reduction in dietary lead was realized by discontinuing the use of lead solder in domestically produced food cans. FDA has also taken steps to minimize or further reduce sources of lead in the diet from lead glazes on ceramicware, leaded crystalware, dietary supplements bottle water, and lead capsules on wine bottles. These actions have resulted in a considerable decrease in the exposure of the United States population to dietary lead.
