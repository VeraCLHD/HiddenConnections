Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidative status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. We also investigate the relation between bone mineral density and oxidative/antioxidative parameters. Thirty-nine patients with osteoporosis and 26 healthy controls were included in the study. Plasma TAS, TOS levels were determined by using a novel automated methods. Plasma TOS and OSI value were significantly higher, and plasma TAS level was lower in patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.001 for all). There was a significant negative correlation between OSI and BMD in lumbar and femoral neck region (r = -0.63, P < 0.001; r = 0.40, P = 0.018). The results of this study indicated that increased osteoclastic activity and decreased osteoblastic activity may be associated with an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant status in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Therefore, supplementation of antioxidant-enriched diet to the therapy might shed light on the development of novel therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis.
