Abstract The effect of dietary calcium on fecal fatty acid excretion and serum lipids was tested in a randomized, single-blind metabolic study in 13 healthy men with moderate hypercholesterolemia. A low calcium base diet containing 34% of energy from fat, 13% from saturated fatty acids, 240 mg cholesterol/d and 410 mg Ca/d was compared with a fortified version in which calcium citrate malate was added to orange juice, (550 mg) muffins (750 mg), and two tablets (500 mg) for a total calcium intake of 2200 mg/d. Fecal collections (72 h, d 8, 9, 10) and blood from fasting subjects for lipids and lipoproteins (d 9, 10, 11) were obtained. The percentage of dietary saturated fat excreted per day increased from 6 to 13% with calcium fortification. There was no change in fecal bile acid excretion. The high Ca diet significantly reduced total cholesterol 6% (5.99 to 5.66 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol 11% (4.13 to 3.67 mmol/L), and apolipoprotein B concentrations 7% when compared with the low Ca diet (P < 0.05). There was no change in HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 concentrations. Urinary calcium excretion increased from 146 to 230 mg/d when the high Ca diet was consumed. Calcium fortification was effective in lowering total and LDL cholesterol concentrations and may be an effective adjunct to cholesterol-lowering diet therapy.
