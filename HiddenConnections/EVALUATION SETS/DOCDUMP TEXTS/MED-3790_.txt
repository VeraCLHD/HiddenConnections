Abstract BACKGROUND: The role of the neutropenic diet in the development of infections in oncology and stem cell transplant (SCT) patients is controversial. There is no data on the use of the neutropenic diet among pediatric oncologists. METHODS: A self-administered electronic survey was sent to 1,639 pediatric oncologists at 198 institutions who are members of Children's Oncology Group. A pediatric dietitian and pediatric oncologists developed, pretested, and modified the survey for item clarification. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-seven physicians (34%) responded representing 174 (87%) of the 198 member institutions. More than half of respondents (57%) report implementing the neutropenic diet at their facility. In a multivariate analysis, being a stem cell transplant (SCT) center was the only significant factor associated with implementing a neutropenic diet (OR: 6.06, 95% CI, 2.88-12.738, P < 0.001) after controlling for years in practice, gender, center size, and academic versus private practice. Among physicians who implemented a neutropenic diet, absolute neutrophil count was the trigger for initiating the diet in oncology patients (72%) while admission and start of preparative regimen was used for SCT patients (84%). The majority of respondents (82%) stop the neutropenic diet when oncology patients are no longer neutropenic while the practice varied significantly with SCT patients. Providers at the same institution were not consistent with implementation of the diet, patient populations placed on the neutropenic diet and parameters for initiation, discontinuation of the diet and specific food restrictions. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the neutropenic diet by pediatric oncologists remains quite variable even among those at the same institution. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
