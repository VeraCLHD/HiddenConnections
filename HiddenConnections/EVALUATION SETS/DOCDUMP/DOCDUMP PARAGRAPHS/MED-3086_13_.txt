A total of 157 polyps were found during the DCBE procedures, and no differences were observed in the number of lesions among the four groups. Peppermint oil did not impair image quality. CONCLUSION: Barium solution mixed with peppermint oil was safe and effective for the elimination of colonic spasm during the DCBE procedure, and it could be used instead of Buscopan.
