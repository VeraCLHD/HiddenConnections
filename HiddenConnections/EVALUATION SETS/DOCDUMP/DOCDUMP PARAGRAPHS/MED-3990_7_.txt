Participants in all three intervention groups had similar levels of nausea at baseline. The nausea levels of participants in the peppermint spirits group were significantly lower than those of participants in the other two groups 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint spirits may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of postoperative nausea.
