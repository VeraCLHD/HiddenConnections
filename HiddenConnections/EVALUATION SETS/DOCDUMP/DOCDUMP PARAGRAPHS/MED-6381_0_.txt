Abstract PURPOSE: The fecal-perineal-urethral hypothesis to explain the cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) by enteric bacteria has been supported by longitudinal studies using methods of serotyping and detecting urovirulence factors such as P fimbriae. However, genetic techniques to more accurately characterize Escherichia coli strains have not been exploited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2,700 E. coli colonies isolated from the urine and rectal swabs of 9 female subjects with acute uncomplicated cystitis and from the rectal swabs of 30 healthy women were serotyped and examined for genes encoding various urovirulence factors by colony hybridization test.
