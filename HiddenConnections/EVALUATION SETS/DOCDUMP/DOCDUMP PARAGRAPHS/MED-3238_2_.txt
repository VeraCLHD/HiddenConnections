The collective data presented in this review strongly indicate that the present classification of AD is incorrect and should be changed to that of a vascular disorder. Such a change in classification would accelerate the development of better treatment targets, patient management, diagnosis, and prevention of this disorder by focusing on the root of the problem. In addition, a theoretical capsule summary is presented detailing how AD may develop from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and the role of critically attained threshold of cerebral hypoperfusion (CATCH) and of vascular nitric oxide derived from endothelial nitric oxide synthase in triggering the cataclysmic cerebromicrovascular pathology.
