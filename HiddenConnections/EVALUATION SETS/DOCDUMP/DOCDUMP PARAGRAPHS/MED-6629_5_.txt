Subjects underwent assessment for weight (primary outcome measure), as well as waist circumference, lipid panel and blood pressure (secondary outcome measures), before and at the end of the 8-week treatment. RESULTS: Weight did not change from baseline after snack bar addition compared to controls (P = 0.44). Waist circumference (P = 0.69), blood pressure (systolic, P = 0.83; diastolic, P = 0.79) and blood lipid panel (total cholesterol, P = 0.72; high-density lipoprotein, P = 0.11; total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein, P = 0.37; triglycerides, P = 0.89; low-density lipoprotein, P = 0.81) also did not change from baseline compared to controls.
