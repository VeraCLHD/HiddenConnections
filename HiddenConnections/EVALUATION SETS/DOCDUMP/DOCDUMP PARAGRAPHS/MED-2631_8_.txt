Also, significant decreases occurred in C-reactive protein (from 2.07 + or - 0.57 to 1.6 + or - 0.43 mg/L, p = 0.03) and interleukin-6 (from 2.52 + or - 0.62 to 1.23 + or - 0.3 pg/ml, p = 0.02) after 12 weeks. Significant improvement in FMD, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 with intensive lifestyle changes in the experimental group suggests > or = 1 potential mechanism underlying the clinical benefits seen in previous trials.
