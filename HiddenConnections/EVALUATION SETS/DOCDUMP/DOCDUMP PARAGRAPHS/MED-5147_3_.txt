According to some epidemiological studies, a lower prevalence of T2DM was found in populations consuming large amounts of seafood products, which are rich in n-3 PUFAs. However, the evidence on the relation between fish intake, dietary n-3 PUFAs, and risk of T2DM is controversial. Therefore, this paper aimed to review the epidemiological and clinical studies on the role of dietary n-3 PUFAs in T2DM.
