High resolution and high sensitivity, combined with the integrative potential of relatively intact histochemical tissue preparations, contributed information that is difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise. In in vivo distribution studies with conventional biochemical assays, target cell populations associated with non-target tissues frequently remain unrecognized without the resolution achieved by cellular autoradiography. Autoradiography, alone or combined with immunohistochemistry when applied to in vivo drug targeting and target characterization, has provided information on cellular-subcellular receptor distribution in over 50 tissues.
