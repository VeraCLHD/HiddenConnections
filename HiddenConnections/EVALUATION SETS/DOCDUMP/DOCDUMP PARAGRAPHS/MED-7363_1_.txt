To assess the damage caused by PS in humans, we designed in vitro experiments by measuring chromosomal aberrations (CAs), sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs), micronucleus (MN) and comet assays. Lymphocytes were treated with negative control (sterile distilled water), positive control (MMC for cultured lymphocytes, and H(2)O(2) for isolated lymphocytes) and four concentrations (125, 250, 500, and 1000 microg/ml) of PS. According to the results, PS treatment significantly increases the CAs (with or without gaps at 500 and 1000 microg/ml concentrations) and SCEs (at 250, 500, 1000 microg/ml for 24h and 125, 250, 500, 1000 microg/ml for 48h) compared with vehicle control.
