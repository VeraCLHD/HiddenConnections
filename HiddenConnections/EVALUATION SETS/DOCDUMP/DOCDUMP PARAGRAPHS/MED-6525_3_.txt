Serum oestradiol concentrations did not differ in the two groups and were also within the normal range. A significant positive correlation between oestradiol and prolactin was found in patients and normals, but with larger prolactin levels in patients. The results point towards a prolactin secretory hypersensitivity for oestradiol in patients with cyclical mastalgia.
