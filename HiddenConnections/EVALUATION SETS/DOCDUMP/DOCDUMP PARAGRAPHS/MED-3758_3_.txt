However, 6 g ginger given intragastrically showed a mean significant increase in DNA-p/min of 3.23 +/- 1.02 (P less than 0.05). Intragastric infusion of 0.3 g uncooked garlic showed a non-significant increase in DNA-p/min of 0.307 +/- 0.59. On the other hand, infusion of 0.75, 1.5 and 3 g of uncooked garlic each caused significant increase in DNA-p/min of 5.47 +/- 1.63 (P less than 0.01), 10.42 +/- 3.46 (P less than 0.01) and 29.26 +/- 4.55 (P less than 0.001) respectively.
