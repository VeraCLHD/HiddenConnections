Abstract Background We have recently demonstrated reversal of fetal ductal constriction after dietary maternal restriction of polyphenol-rich foods (PRF), due to its inhibitory action on prostaglandin synthesis. Objective To test the hyphotesis that normal third trimester fetuses also improve ductus arteriosus dynamics after maternal restriction of polyphenols. Methods Open clinical trial with 46 fetuses with gestational age (GA) â‰¥ 28 weeks submitted to 2 Doppler echocardiographic studies with an interval of at least 2 weeks, being the examiners blinded to maternal dietary habits.
