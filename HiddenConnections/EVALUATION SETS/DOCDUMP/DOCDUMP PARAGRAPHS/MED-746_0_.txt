Abstract Objective We examined the association between adolescent fiber intake and proliferative BBD, a marker of increased breast cancer risk, in the Nursesâ€™ Health Study II. Methods Among 29,480 women who completed a high school diet questionnaire in 1998, 682 proliferative BBD cases were identified and confirmed by centralized pathology review between 1991 and 2001. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
