Abstract The evidence that estrogen protects against coronary heart disease is biologically plausible, consistent, and strong. These benefits have not been established by a randomized trial, however, so that the degree of protection against heart disease might have been overestimated because estrogen users tend to be healthier than nonusers. A randomized trial to determine whether estrogen alone or in combination with progestin protects against coronary heart disease should be given a high priority.
