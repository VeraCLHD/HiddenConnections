OBJECTIVE: To systematically review whether supplementation with vitamin D or its analogues reduce BP. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and http://www.ClinicalTrials.com augmented by a hand search of references from the included articles and previous reviews. Google was searched for gray literature (ie, material not published in recognized scientific journals).
