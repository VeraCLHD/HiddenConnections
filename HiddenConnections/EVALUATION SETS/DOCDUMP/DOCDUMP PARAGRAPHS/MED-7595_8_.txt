Only 1 patient with structural injury had a circulating level of creatine phosphokinase that was elevated more than 1950 U/L (10Ã— the upper limit of normal). Expression of ryanodine receptor 3 was significantly upregulated in patients with biopsy evidence of structural damage (1.7, standard error of the mean 0.3). Interpretation Persistent myopathy in patients taking statins reflects structural muscle damage.
