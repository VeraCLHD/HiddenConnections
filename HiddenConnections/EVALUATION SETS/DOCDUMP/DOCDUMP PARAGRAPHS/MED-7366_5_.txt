The unnatural trans-trans isomer of linoleic acid, which had never been in human food prior to 1920 and which entered our food in margarines and refined oils, blocked the conversion of natural cis-cis linoleic acid to prostaglandin E1, which tends to prevent MI, both by acting as a vasodilator and by minimizing platelet aggregation. Harmful lactones were also introduced into our food, increasing the risk of MI by decreasing the fibrinolytic activity of our blood. The oil seed industry also introduced into our diet free radical lipid peroxides that make the myocardium more vulnerable to infarction.
