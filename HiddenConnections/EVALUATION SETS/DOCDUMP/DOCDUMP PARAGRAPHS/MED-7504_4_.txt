Subjects consumed a self-restricted glucosinolate-free diet 48 h before the study-day where a basic diet supplemented with 80 or 350 g of mixed cruciferous vegetables was consumed. All urine was collected in intervals during the 48 h period after ingestion of the cruciferous vegetables. Total ITC in the cruciferous mixture and total ITC and their metabolites in urine was quantified as the cyclocondensation product of 1,2-bezenedithiol by high performance liquid chromatography.
