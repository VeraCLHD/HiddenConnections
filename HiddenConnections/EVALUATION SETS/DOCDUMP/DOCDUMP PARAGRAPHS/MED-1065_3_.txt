METHODS: We searched for data from population-based surveys in which serological methods were used to test all participants. Weighted regression of logit-transformed prevalence and sensitization rates were used to evaluate the effects of the year of survey, age, and degree of urbanization. We also analyzed the relationship between prevalence and sensitization rate.
