EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have evaluated, in vitro and in vivo, the effects of BAY 86-9766, a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, in a panel of human colorectal cancer cell lines with primary or acquired resistance to cetuximab. RESULTS: Among the colorectal cancer cell lines, five with a KRAS mutation (LOVO, HCT116, HCT15, SW620, and SW480) and one with a BRAF mutation (HT29) were resistant to the antiproliferative effects of cetuximab, whereas two cells (GEO and SW48) were highly sensitive. Treatment with BAY 86-9766 determined dose-dependent growth inhibition in all cancer cells, including two human colorectal cancer cells with acquired resistance to cetuximab (GEO-CR and SW48-CR), with the exception of HCT15 cells.
