We performed stratified randomization of drug-na√Øve (n=34) and treated (n=34) hypertensive patients aged 18-85 years. The primary end-point was change in clinic, ambulatory and home blood pressure compared to placebo. Daily supplementation with dietary nitrate was associated with reduction in blood pressure measured by 3 different methods.
