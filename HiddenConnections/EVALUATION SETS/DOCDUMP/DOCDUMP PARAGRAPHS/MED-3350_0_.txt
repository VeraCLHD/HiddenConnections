Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that energy-yielding beverages evoke weaker appetitive responses than more solid food items, but the properties responsible have not been characterized. The present study attempted to isolate an influence of viscosity. At weekly intervals, 84 adults ingested 325-ml (220 kcal) shakes that were matched on weight, volume, temperature, energy, macronutrient content, energy density, rate of consumption, cognitive expectations, palatability, appearance, and requirements for mechanical processing, but varied in viscosity.
