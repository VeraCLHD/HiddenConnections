At 24 weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between the placebo group and any of the active-treatment groups for the change from baseline in testosterone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)stimulated testosterone, free testosterone index, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences at week 12 or week 24 for the change from baseline in sperm concentration, ejaculate volume, or sperm motility for any active treatment relative to placebo. Both simvastatin and pravastatin were well tolerated.
