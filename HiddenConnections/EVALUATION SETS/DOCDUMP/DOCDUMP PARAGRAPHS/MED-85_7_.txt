In nude mice bearing established human HCT15, HCT116, SW48-CR, and GEO-CR xenografts, the combined treatment with cetuximab and BAY 86-9766 caused significant tumor growth inhibition and increased mice survival. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that activation of MEK is involved in both primary and acquired resistance to cetuximab and the inhibition of EGFR and MEK could be a strategy for overcoming anti-EGFR resistance in patients with colorectal cancer.
