These diseases are also the leading causes of chronic kidney diseases and end-stage renal disease. The lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis, proposed over three decades ago, suggested that proteinuria, decreased albumin levels, and the resultant hyperlipidemia may cause a glomerulosclerosis similar to atherosclerosis. More recent studies have demonstrated the role of oxidized high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the progression of kidney disease.
