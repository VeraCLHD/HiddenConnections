Abstract Salmonella enterica is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness in the United States. Although salmonellosis is usually self-limiting, severe infections typically require antimicrobial treatment and ceftriaxone, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is commonly used in both adults and children. Surveillance conducted by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) has shown a recent increase in extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistance among Salmonella Heidelberg isolated from food animals at slaughter, retail meat, and humans.
