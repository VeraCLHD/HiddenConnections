We describe a young single male vegetarian who developed a cobalamin-induced psychotic episode without preceding neurologic manifestations and without any hematologic symptoms. He recovered after a short course of antipsychotics and oral cobalamin supplementation and remained asymptomatic and functionally independent at 1 year of follow-up.
