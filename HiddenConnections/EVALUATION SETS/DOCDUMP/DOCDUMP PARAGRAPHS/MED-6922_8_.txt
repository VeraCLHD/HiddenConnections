Increasing urine BPA level was associated with decreased sexual desire (P < .001), more difficulty having an erection (P < .001), lower ejaculation strength (P < .001), and lower level of overall satisfaction with sex life (P < .01). A similar negative correlation was also observed among participants exposed to BPA from only environmental sources (no occupational exposure to BPA), although the estimates in this group were less stable because of a smaller sample size. Our results reveal a correlation between a biological measure of urine BPA level and declining male sexual function.
