Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was determined as a measure of endothelial function before and 2 and 3 h after ingestion of 100-g saccharose. Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between the changes of glucose and FMD (r = 0.416, P = 0.0018) 2 h after ingestion of saccharose.
