Obesity was not associated with exposure to other environmental phenols commonly used in other consumer products, such as sunscreens and soaps. In stratified analysis, significant associations between urinary BPA concentrations and obesity were found among whites (P < .001) but not among blacks or Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary BPA concentration was significantly associated with obesity in this cross-sectional study of children and adolescents.
