When antacids were taken with water, a slight, but significant increase in serum aluminium concentration was seen with 4, but not with 1 or with 8 tablets. Following all doses of antacid, a significant increase in 24 h urinary excretion of aluminium was seen. The estimated absorption of aluminium was 8 and 50 times higher when antacids were taken with orange juice or with citric acid, respectively, than when taken with water.
