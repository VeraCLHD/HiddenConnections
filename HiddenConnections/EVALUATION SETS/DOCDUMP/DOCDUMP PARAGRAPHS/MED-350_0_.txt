Abstract BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Coffee is known to contain antioxidant substances whose effects may be blunted because of caffeine that may unfavorably affect the cardiovascular system. This study was designed to investigate the acute dose-dependent effects of decaffeinated coffee (DC) on endothelial function measured by the brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 15 (8 men and 7 women) healthy nonobese subjects underwent a single-blind, crossover study.
