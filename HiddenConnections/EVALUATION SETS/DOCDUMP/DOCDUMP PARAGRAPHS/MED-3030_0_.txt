Abstract The fecal floras of polyp patients, Japanese-Hawaiians, North American Caucasians, rural native Japanese, and rural native Africans were compared. The polyp patients and Japanese-Hawaiians were considered to be groups at high risk of colon cancer, and the rural native Japanese and rural native Africans were considered to be groups at low risk. The North American Caucasians were found to have a flora composition intermediate between these two groups.
