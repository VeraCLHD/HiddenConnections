The distributions of these data were skewed but not clearly bimodal by visual inspection or by kernel density analysis. Four subjects produced visibly red urine and had betacyanin recoveries at the upper end of the population range. Studies using in situ isolated perfused rat jejunum and liver preparations indicated a negligible absorption of the pigments after 1 h and no detectable metabolism or biliary secretion.
