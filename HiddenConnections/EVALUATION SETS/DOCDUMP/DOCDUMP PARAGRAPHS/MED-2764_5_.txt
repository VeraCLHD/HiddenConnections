Certain foods can lead to a decreased or increased risk of development of gout and hyperuricemia. Advances have established the interplay of certain foods on urate transporters and renal handling of urate. More studies, especially prospective ones, are needed to increase our understanding of the roles of foods and urate transporters and other molecular mechanisms on the risk of developing gout and hyperuricemia.
