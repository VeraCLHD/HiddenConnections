Conclusions Higher levels of baseline sMG were associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline, after adjusting for several sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. This relationship did not differ by sex, APOE4 genotype, or diabetes status suggesting its generality. Since subjects were cognitively normal at the beginning of the study, elevated sMG may be indicative of brain cell injury initiated before clinically evident cognitive compromise.
