The immediate weeks following bereavement represent the highest risk period with both men and women across all ages. Risk is evident irrespective of the nature of death, expected or unexpected, although higher level of social support at the time of death may be protective. Evidence would suggest that for many, bereavement results in a time of increased psychological stress and potential for altered behavioural health risk factors that in the presence of altered physiological state, may serve as a potential trigger of cardiovascular events, especially in those most at risk.
