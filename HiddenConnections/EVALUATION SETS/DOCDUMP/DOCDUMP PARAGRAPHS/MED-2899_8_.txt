At year 5, fT4 was the only measure to show a significant difference between groups (mean and 95% Confidence Interval) 15.6 (15.1, 16.1) and 14.7 (14.2, 15.1) pmol/L triclosan and placebo respectively (p=0.01). This reflects reduced levels in the placebo group but no change in the triclosan group. In conclusion, over 4 years triclosan toothpaste had no detectable effect on thyroid function.
