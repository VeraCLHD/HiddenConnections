Abstract BACKGROUND: Systemic administration of a cholinergic blocking agent or glucagon is used to reduce spasms, but it is inconvenient and sometimes causes side effects. This study is an evaluation of the intracolonic administration of peppermint oil during colonoscopy for the control of colonic spasm. METHODS: Each patient in the treated group (n = 409) was given approximately 200 mL of the solution (a mixture of 8 mL of peppermint oil and 0.2 mL of Tween 80 per 1 L of water with 0.04% indigo carmine) by using a hand pump attached to the accessory channel of the colonoscope.
