Neutropenic diets were once thought to be important in protecting patients from having to succumb to infection from neutropenia while undergoing chemotherapy. Although food may contain harmful organisms and research has shown that bacterial translocation is possible, recent studies have been unable to obtain significant differences between placebo and intervention groups. The dietetic challenges neutropenic patients struggle with include decreased quality of life, malnutrition, gastrointestinal side effects, food aversion, and impaired cell-mediated immunity from vitamin deficiency.
