Copper was significantly elevated (P<0.05) in the rim of SP compared with AD neuropil. Comparison of AD and control neuropil revealed a significant (P<0.05) elevation of Zn in AD subjects. The elevation of these elements in SP in AD is of interest in light of the observation that Cu, Fe and particularly Zn, can accelerate aggregation of amyloid beta peptide.
