FDA used Osborne-Mendel strain rats, IBT used Charles River, and NCTR used both strains. No significant increases in skeletal or visceral abnormalities were seen. No significant increase in resorptions was seen in the Osborne-Mendel strain, but the Charles River strain at IBT showed a significant increase in litters with two or more resorptions after dams had been given 200 mg/kg at 0-19 days of gestation.
