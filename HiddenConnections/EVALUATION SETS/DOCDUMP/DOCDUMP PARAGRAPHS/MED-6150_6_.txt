In all, patients were diagnosed with negative IHD; their mean PSV was 36.21 cm/s. A statistically significant difference was observed between patients with positive IHD and patients with negative IHD regarding PSV (P = 0.003). The sensitivity of a PSV of less than 35 cm/s in predicting IHD was 50% with a specificity of 100%.
