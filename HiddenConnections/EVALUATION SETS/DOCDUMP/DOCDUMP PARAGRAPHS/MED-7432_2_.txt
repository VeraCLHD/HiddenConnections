We searched the biomedical literature for reports documenting cases of cysticercosis acquired in the United States. A total of 78 cases, principally neurocysticercosis, were reported from 12 states during 1954â€“2005. A confirmed or presumptive source of infection was identified among household members or close personal contacts of 16 (21%) case-patients.
