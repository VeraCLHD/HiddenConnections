When the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUa) was calculated, the values were clearly increased in both the NS and SF groups after the intake of tea and returned to baseline values in the washout period. These changes were more clearly observed when the data for each subject was presented individually. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a uricosuric effect of Roselle calyces.
