Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In 1981, a Petrol-Lead Phase-Out Program (PLPOP) was launched in Taiwan for the abatement of environmental lead emissions. The present study was intended to examine whether the high Petrol-Lead Emission Areas (PLEA) would result in an increase in the incidence rate of brain cancer based on a national data bank. METHODS: The national brain cancer incidence data was obtained from the Taiwan National Cancer Registry.
