Abstract Bioactivity-guided fractionation of Red Delicious apple peels was used to determine the chemical identity of bioactive constituents, which showed potent antiproliferative and antioxidant activities. Twenty-nine compounds, including triterpenoids, flavonoids, organic acids and plant sterols, were isolated using gradient solvent fractionation, Diaion HP-20, silica gel, and ODS columns, and preparative HPLC. Their chemical structures were identified using HR-MS and 1D and 2D NMR.
