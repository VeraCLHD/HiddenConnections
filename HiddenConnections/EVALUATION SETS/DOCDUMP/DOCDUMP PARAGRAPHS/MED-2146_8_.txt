Solarium use once or more per month for at least one decade increased the risk of all-cause mortality, when compared with women who never used a solarium. CONCLUSIONS: Solar UV exposure was associated with reduced overall and CVD mortality, whereas artificial UV exposure was associated with increased overall and cancer mortality among Swedish women. IMPACT: Moderate sun exposure may protect against cause-specific mortality.
