Flow mediated dilation significantly reduced after smoking compared to baseline in both groups. However, NMD remained unchanged after smoking in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased WT and impaired endothelium-dependent dilatation of brachial artery suggests that cigarette smoking disrupts vessel wall morphology long before atherosclerosis is manifest.
