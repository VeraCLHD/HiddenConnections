Abstract As part of a major study to identify cariogenic elements of foods, the cariogenic potential of 22 foods relative to sucrose (confectioners' sugar) was determined over six intubation rat caries experiments. Cariogenic potential indices were calculated for each food from sulcal and buccal-lingual caries based on both number and severity. Those foods with the lowest cariogenic potential indices were peanuts, gelatin dessert, corn chips, yoghurt, and bologna; with the highest cariogenic potential indices were sucrose, granola cereal, french fries, bananas, cupcakes, and raisins.
