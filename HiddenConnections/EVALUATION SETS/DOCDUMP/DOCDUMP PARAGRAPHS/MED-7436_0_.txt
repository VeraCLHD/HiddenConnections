Abstract The current paradigm for the management of lipids is focused almost entirely on fasting lipid levels. However, most of the day is spent not in a fasting state, but in a postprandial state. Meals high in animal fat impair endothelial function for 4 h, an effect that can be minimized by pretreatment with antioxidant vitamins.
