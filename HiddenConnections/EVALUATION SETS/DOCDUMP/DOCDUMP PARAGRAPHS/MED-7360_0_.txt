Abstract Background The US diet is high in salt, with the majority coming from processed foods. Reducing dietary salt is an important potential public health target. Methods We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model to quantify the benefits of potentially achievable population-wide reductions in dietary salt of up to 3 gm/day (1200 mg/day of sodium).
