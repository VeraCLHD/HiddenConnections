The association between ADC values of disks, the disk degeneration, and the status of lumbar arteries of the same level were analyzed with analysis of covariance, and pairwise analysis between groups (Scheff√© post hoc multiple comparison) was performed with statistical software. P values less than .01 were considered significant. RESULTS: The lumbar arterial status correlated strongly with the diffusion values of intervertebral disks, and the ADC values decreased with higher degrees of arterial narrowing.
