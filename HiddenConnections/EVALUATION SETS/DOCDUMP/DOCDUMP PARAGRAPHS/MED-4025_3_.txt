Among a number of Ca2+ sensors in the eukaryotic cell, calmodulin (CaM) is the most widespread and the best studied. Employing the mRNA display technique, we have scanned the human proteome for CaM-binding proteins and have identified and characterized a large number of both known and previously uncharacterized proteins that interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The interactions of several identified proteins with Ca2+/CaM were confirmed by using pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation.
