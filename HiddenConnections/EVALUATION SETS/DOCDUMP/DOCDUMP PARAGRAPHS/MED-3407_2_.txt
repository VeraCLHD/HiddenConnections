To accomplish this regulatory function, bile acids may induce programmed cell death fostering the renewal of the epithelium. Here we first discuss on the different molecular pathways of cell death focusing on apoptosis in colon epithelial cells. Bile acids may induce apoptosis in colonocytes through different mechanisms.
