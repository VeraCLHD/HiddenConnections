RESULTS Approximately 5.0% of the cohort developed GDM (n = 158). Heme iron intake was positively and significantly associated with GDM risk (Ptrend = 0.04). After adjusting for confounders, women reporting the highest heme iron intake levels (≥1.52 vs. <0.48 mg per day) experienced a 3.31-fold–increased GDM risk (95% CI 1.02–10.72).
