However, HDL-C was also significantly lower on the tofu diet (mean difference 0.08 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02, 0.14; P=0.01) although the LDL-C:HDL-C ratio was similar. CONCLUSION: The effect on HDL-C and the small LDL-C reduction differ from some other studies, where fat was often less controlled, and the comparison was of soy as textured protein or soymilk against casein. This suggests a differential effect of the various proteins compared to the soy may influence the findings.
