Thus natural occurring anti-Gal alpha(1,3)Gal antibodies found in all human serum can react with self (Muc1) peptides expressed in large amounts on the surface of tumour cells but not on normal cells. The findings are of interest and serve to explain the previously reported findings that human cells can, at times, express Gal alpha(1,3)Gal; such expression is an artefact, the reaction is due to the phenomenon described herein, i.e. that anti-Gal alpha(1,3)Gal antibodies react with mucin peptides.
