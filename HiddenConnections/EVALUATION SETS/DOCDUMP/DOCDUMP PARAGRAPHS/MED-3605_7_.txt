RESULTS: Elevated homocysteine was associated with reduced global cerebral volume, larger ventricles, reduced cerebral white matter volume, and lower cognitive performance in several domains. Elevated homocysteine was associated with reduced white matter volume (β = -20.80, t = -2.9, df = 223, p = 0.004) and lower speed of processing (β = -0.38, t = -2.1, df = 223, p = 0.03), even after controlling for age, gender, and education. However, the association between homocysteine and lower speed of processing disappeared after controlling for white matter volume.
