During the oat bran intervention the fecal butyrate concentration increased by 36% at 4 weeks (from 11 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) to 15 +/- 2 micromol/g feces) (p < 0.01). The mean butyrate concentration over the entire test period was 14 +/- 1 micromol/g feces (p < 0.05). Remaining fecal SCFA levels were unchanged.
