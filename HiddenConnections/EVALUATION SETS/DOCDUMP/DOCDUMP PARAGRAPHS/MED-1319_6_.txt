Calcified parenchymal brain cysticerci were more frequent among patients with primary headache than in those with cerebrovascular disease (4.7% vs 1%, p < 0.001), degenerative disorders of the CNS (4.7% vs 2.4%, p < 0.05), and head trauma (4.7% vs 2.3%, p < 0.05). There were no significant differences, however, for the subset of controls with primary brain tumors (4.7% vs 3.5%), a condition that has also been associated with neurocysticercosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a relationship between calcified neurocysticercosis and primary headache disorders.
