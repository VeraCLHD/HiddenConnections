Given the benefits of eating raw foods, nutrient sources need to be identified that deliver substantial benefit without cooking. In this study a survey of carotenoid bioaccessibility was carried out in order to additionally evaluate the impact of their distinctive storage structures (chromoplasts) on bioaccessibility. RESULTS: Per cent carotenoid bioaccessibility varied among the nine raw, whole fruits and vegetables evaluated, with values of 1-39% for lycopene, 18-20% for α-carotene, 7-49% for β-carotene, 9-59% for lutein, 4-22% for violaxanthin and 47-96% for phytoene.
