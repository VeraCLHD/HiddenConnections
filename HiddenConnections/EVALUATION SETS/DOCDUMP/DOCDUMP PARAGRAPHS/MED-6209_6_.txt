Both groups improved the anaerobic threshold by 20% (P<0.05), but blood lactate concentration decreased 27% in the experimental group compared to the 17% control group, suggesting that experimental group has less muscle fatigue and better response to training. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of 500 mL/d of orange juice associated with aerobic training in overweight women decreased cardiovascular disease risk by reducing LDL-C levels and increasing HDL-C levels. This association also decreased blood lactate concentration and increased anaerobic threshold, showing some improvement in the physical performance.
