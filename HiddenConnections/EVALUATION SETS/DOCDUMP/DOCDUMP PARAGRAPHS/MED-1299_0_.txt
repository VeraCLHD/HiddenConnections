Abstract We examined the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and sympathetic nervous system activity of young male vegetarians (n = 17) and nonvegetarians (n = 40). Subjects were characterized for RMR by indirect calorimetry, norepinephrine kinetics from infusions of tritiated norepinephrine, energy and macronutrient intake from a 3-day food diary, and body composition by underwater weighing. Vegetarians reported a greater relative intake of carbohydrates (62% +/- 5% v 51% +/- 6%, P < .01) and a lower relative intake of fat (25% +/- 5% v 33% +/- 6%, P < .01) than nonvegetarians, whereas no differences were observed in daily energy intake, body composition, or maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) between groups.
