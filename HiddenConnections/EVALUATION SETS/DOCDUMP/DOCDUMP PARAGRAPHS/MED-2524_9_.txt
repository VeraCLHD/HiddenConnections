CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that, even at a very low concentration, BBP, DBP, and DEHP were not only still capable of inducing a proliferative effect through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway but also displaying estrogenic activity. Therefore, the current reference doses for phthalates defined by governments should be further evaluated.
