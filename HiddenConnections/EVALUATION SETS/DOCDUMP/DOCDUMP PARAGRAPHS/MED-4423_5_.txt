We documented 1559 strokes (853 ischemic, 278 hemorrhagic) among women and 994 strokes (600 ischemic, 161 hemorrhagic) among men during follow-up. Women with all five low-risk factors had a relative risk of 0.21 (95%CI:0.12, 0.36) for total and 0.19 (95%CI:0.09, 0.40) for ischemic stroke, compared to women who had none of these factors. Among men, the relative risks were 0.31 (95%CI:0.19, 0.53) for total and 0.20 (95%CI: 0.10, 0.42) for ischemic stroke for the same comparison.
