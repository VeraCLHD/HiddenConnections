As the percentages of motile and morphologically normal spermatozoa and semen volume increased, mortality decreased in a dose-response manner (P(trend) < 0.05). The decrease in mortality among men with good semen quality was due to a decrease in a wide range of diseases and was found among men both with and without children; therefore, the decrease in mortality could not be attributed solely to lifestyle and/or social factors. Semen quality may therefore be a fundamental biomarker of overall male health.
