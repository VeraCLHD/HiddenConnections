RESULTS All vascular structures ≥ 8μm in diameter were preserved. Thoracic and lumbar segmental arteries (SAs) give rise not only to the anterior spinal artery (ASA), but to an extensive paraspinous network feeding the erector spinae, iliopsoas, and associated muscles. The ASA, mean diameter 134±20 μm, is connected at multiple points to repetitive circular epidural arteries with mean diameters of 150±26 μm.
