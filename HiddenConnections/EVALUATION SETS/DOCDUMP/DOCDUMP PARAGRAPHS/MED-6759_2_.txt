Information on dental practices, diet, residential movements, and socioeconomic status were obtained from self-completed questionnaires. RESULTS: Caries risk in the permanent teeth was associated with social disadvantage and diet. Among the dietary factors, the frequency of fruit consumption was associated with higher odds of caries experience (odds ratio: 1.52, 95% confidence intervals: 1.05, 2.21).
