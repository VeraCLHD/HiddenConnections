The main outcomes were fructosamine, glycated Hb (HbA1c), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Literature searches identified sixteen studies that met the strict inclusion criteria. Low-GI diets significantly reduced fructosamine by -0.1 (95 % CI -0.20, 0.00) mmol/l (P=0.05), HbA1c by 0.27 (95 % CI -0.5, -0.03) % (P=0.03), total cholesterol by -0.33 (95 % CI -0.47, -0.18) mmol/l (P<0.0001) and tended to reduce LDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetic subjects by -0.15 (95 % CI -0.31, -0.00) mmol/l (P=0.06) compared with high-GI diets.
