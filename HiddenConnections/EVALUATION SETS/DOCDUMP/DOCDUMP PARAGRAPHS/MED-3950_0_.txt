Abstract BACKGROUND: Plaque rupture and/or erosion is the leading cause of cardiovascular events; however, the process is not well understood. Although certain morphologic characteristics have been associated with ruptured plaques, these observations are of static histological images and not of the dynamics of plaque rupture. To elucidate the process of plaque rupture, we investigated the transformation of cholesterol from liquid to solid crystal to determine whether growing crystals are capable of injuring the plaque cap.
