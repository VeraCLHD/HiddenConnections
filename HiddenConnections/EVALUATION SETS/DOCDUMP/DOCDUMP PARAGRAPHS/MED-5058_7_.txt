The gap in life expectancy at birth in males was 8.5 years during 1971-1973, increasing to 13.5 years by 1998-2000, however, the gap in females remained relatively stable (8.0 years and 8.4 years, respectively). Of the 13.5-year difference in life expectancy in males, the differential mortality from diseases of the digestive system (mainly due to cirrhosis of the liver), accidents (from both motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle accidents), and infectious and parasitic disease contributed half (50%) of the gap in life expectancy. In females, the above primarily preventable causes of deaths accounted for 41% of the life expectancy gap.
