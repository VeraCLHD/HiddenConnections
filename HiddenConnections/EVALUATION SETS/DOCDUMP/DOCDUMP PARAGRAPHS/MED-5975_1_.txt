We used a ratio of animal:vegetable proteins (A:V ratio) to evaluate whether a comprehensive dietary change was self-sustaining following completion of 11 weekly dietary and cooking classes that integrated mindfulness training (MT). Thirty-six men with recurring CaP were randomized to the intervention or wait-list control. Assessments were at baseline, three months and six months.
