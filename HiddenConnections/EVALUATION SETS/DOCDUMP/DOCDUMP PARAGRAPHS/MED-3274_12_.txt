CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.
