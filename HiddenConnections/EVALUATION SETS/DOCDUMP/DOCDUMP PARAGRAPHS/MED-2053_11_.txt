Premenopausal women enjoy a relative protection from kidney failure; since ERbeta is an antagonist of TGF-beta signaling in mesangial cells, soy isoflavones may have nephroprotective potential. Estrogen also appears to protect women from left ventricular hypertrophy, and recent evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by ERbeta. In conjunction with reports that isoflavones may have a modestly beneficial impact on menopausal symptoms - perhaps reflecting the presence of ERbeta in the hypothalamus - these considerations suggest that soy isoflavone regimens of sufficient potency may represent a safe and moderately effective alternative to HRT in postmenopausal women.
