A reanalysis of the data showed a nonsignificant protective effect among younger women and a nonsignificant increase in risk among older women. Overall, the bulk of the evidence strongly supports a protective effect of estrogens that is unlikely to be explained by confounding factors. This benefit is consistent with the effect of estrogens on lipoprotein subfractions (decreasing low-density lipoprotein levels and elevating high-density lipoprotein levels).
