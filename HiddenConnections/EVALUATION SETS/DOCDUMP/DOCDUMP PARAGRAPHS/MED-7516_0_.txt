Abstract Androgenic steroids always exist in different animal tissues at trace level, with significant numbers of interfering compounds, which makes their determination difficult. To solve some of the problems in quantification of the natural steroids in those tissues, a new GC-MS method was developed in this study. By using a surrogate analyte approach, which was developed in the authors' previous studies, and extensive sample preparation procedure, which successfully eliminates many of the interfering compounds and resulting in a cleaner extract, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and selectivity of the method for the determination of steroids in complex matrices such as meat, liver and testis were improved.
