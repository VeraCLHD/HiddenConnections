We estimated the association between nutrients or foods and IBD using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for energy intake. RESULTS: Among 67,581 participants (705,445 person-years, mean follow-up since completion of the baseline dietary questionnaire 10.4 years), we validated 77 incident IBD cases. High total protein intake, specifically animal protein, was associated with a significantly increased risk of IBD, (hazards ratio for the third vs. first tertile and 95% confidence interval being 3.31 and 1.41-7.77 (P trend=0.007), and 3.03 and 1.45-6.34 (P trend=0.005) for total and animal protein, respectively).
