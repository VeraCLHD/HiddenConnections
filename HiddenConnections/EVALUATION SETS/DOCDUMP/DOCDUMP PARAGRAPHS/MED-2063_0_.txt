Abstract An assay, employing microsomes prepared from rat liver and a recombinant cell bioassay (RCBA) expressing the human oestrogen receptor (alpha) linked to a reporter gene, was evaluated for the detection of pro-oestrogens in food using methoxychlor and mestranol as model compounds. Bio-activation of the hop phytoestrogen isoxanthohumol to the potent oestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin was also investigated. The oestrogenic potency values for reference standards determined with the RCBA (17beta-oestradiol = 100%) were: methoxychlor 0.0025%, mestranol 1.3%, isoxanthohumol 0.001%, and for their potential respective metabolites were: bishydroxymethoxychlor 0.015%, 17alpha-ethynyl oestradiol 69% and 8-prenylnaringenin 0.4%.
