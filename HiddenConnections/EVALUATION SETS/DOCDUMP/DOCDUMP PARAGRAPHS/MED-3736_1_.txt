To determine whether a capsule containing a quarter of the standard dose of 4 antihypertensive agents has greater efficacy than the standard dose of each individually, we prospectively randomized 108 untreated white hypertensive patients (55% male) aged 50+/-1 years (mean+/-SEM), with mean blood pressure 160+/-1/96+/-1 mm Hg. Patients received amlodipine (5 mg; n=22), atenolol (50 mg; n=20), bendroflumethiazide (2.5 mg; n=22), captopril (50 mg twice daily; n=22) or a capsule containing each of the 4 above at one-quarter dosage (n=22) in a parallel group design for 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured using a semiautomated device (Omron 705), and the reduction in mean arterial pressure with the combined preparation was compared with that of the individual components.
