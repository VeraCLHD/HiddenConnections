Abstract Background: There is increasing interest in the potential effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) on childrenâ€™s neuropsychological development, but only a few small studies have evaluated such effects. Objectives: Our goal was to examine the association between PBDE concentrations in colostrum and infant neuropsychological development and to assess the influence of other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on such association. Methods: We measured concentrations of PBDEs and other POPs in colostrum samples of 290 women recruited in a Spanish birth cohort.
