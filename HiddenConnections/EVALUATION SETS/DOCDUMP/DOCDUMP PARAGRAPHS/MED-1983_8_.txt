BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and was correlated with age, height, weight, fractures, nutritional factors, hormonal status, and bone biomarkers. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in hip BMD between women and men (0.799 vs. 0.896 g/cm(2), p = 0.014). The percentage of subjects with BMD-Z <-2.0 was also greater for women than men [33 vs. 18 % (spine), 27 vs. 6 % (hip)], and more women reported sustaining fractures.
