Physiological variables that were monitored were heart rate, rhythm, dysrhythmias, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen (tcpO2), rate pressure product, and behavioral state, measured during 14 circumcision steps. Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal. Few significant differences were found among any of the steps.
