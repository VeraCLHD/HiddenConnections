A 14, 24, and 26% greater likelihood of using multivitamins was also observed among men consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and tea, respectively. Similar associations were observed for the likelihood of using multivitamins with other supplements; however, men with higher physical activity, history of cancer, hypertension, higher consumption of nuts, and lower consumption of red meat and coffee were also more likely to use multivitamins with other supplements (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Self-reported multivitamin use associated with lifestyle, clinical and dietary factors may be an indicator of healthy behaviors.
