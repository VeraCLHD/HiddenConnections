The apolar nature of carotenoids precludes their simple diffusion from the food structure to the absorption site at the enterocyte. Therefore, there is interest in the potential pathways for solubilization in the gut before absorption. We have studied the transfer of carotenoids from carrot juice and homogenized spinach into lipid phases that mimic the intestinal lumen at the start of digestion.
