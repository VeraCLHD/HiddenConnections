METHODS: With ultrasound technique, we measured flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation during oral glucose tolerance test in 58 subjects: (17 patients with normal glucose tolerance [NGT], 24 with IGT, and 17 with type 2 DM). In addition, we measured the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nitrite/nitrate. RESULTS: Flow-mediated vasodilation decreased after glucose loading (NGT: 7.53+/-0.40, 4.24+/-0.28 and 6.35+/-0.40, in fasting, at 1- and 2-h, respectively, IGT: 6.50+/-0.48, 1.40+/-0.41** and 4.00+/-0.47*, respectively; DM: 4.77+/-0.37, 1.35+/-0.38** and 1.29+/-0.29%**, respectively; *p < 0.01 vs. fasting, **p < 0.005 vs. fasting).
