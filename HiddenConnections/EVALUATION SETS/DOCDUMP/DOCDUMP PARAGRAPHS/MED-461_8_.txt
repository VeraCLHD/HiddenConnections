The performance of mass spectrometry still needs to be improved for confirmation of oestrogen concentrations in most food. At present, the potential relevance of oestradiol acyl esters, the actual daily production rate of oestradiol in prepubertal children, and the role of oestradiol metabolites in cancer are obscure. The presence of different cytoplasmic oestrogen receptor subtypes and potential oestradiol effects in non-reproductive functions require further examination.
