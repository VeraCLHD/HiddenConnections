Abstract BACKGROUND: The most recent international dietary protein recommendations for healthy adults are those developed and proposed by the 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU Joint Expert Consultation. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to analyze available nitrogen balance data to establish new recommendations for the protein required by healthy adults. DESIGN: Data were gathered from published nitrogen balance studies that had as their primary objective either the estimation of basal or maintenance requirements or the testing of the adequacy of specific nitrogen intakes in healthy adults.
