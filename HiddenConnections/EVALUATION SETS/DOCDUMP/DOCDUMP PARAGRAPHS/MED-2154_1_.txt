NO is synthesized by a family of NO synthase enzymes, but its rapid release following UV exposure suggests the existence of preformed stores. NO can be converted into nitrite or nitrosothiols that are stable until cleaved by UV to release NO. Using dermal microdialysis, suction blister epidermal samples, and sweat collection, we demonstrated cutaneous concentrations of total NO-related products of 12+/-5.97 microM, 0.03+/-0.03 micromol mg(-1) epidermal protein, and 22+/-9.34 microM, respectively.
