Women with all five low-risk factors had a relative risk of 0.21 (95%CI:0.12, 0.36) for total and 0.19 (95%CI:0.09, 0.40) for ischemic stroke, compared to women who had none of these factors. Among men, the relative risks were 0.31 (95%CI:0.19, 0.53) for total and 0.20 (95%CI: 0.10, 0.42) for ischemic stroke for the same comparison. Among the women, 47% (95%CI:18%, 69%) of total and 54% (95%CI:15%, 78%) of ischemic stroke cases were attributable to lack of adherence to a low-risk lifestyle; among the men, 35% (95%CI:7%, 58%) of total and 52% (95%CI:19%, 75%) of ischemic stroke may have been prevented.
