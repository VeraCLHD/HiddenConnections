We took advantage of California's unique population-based cancer surveillance resources to assess whether regional changes in breast cancer incidence observed between 2001 and 2004 correlated with regional changes in EPHT use between 2001 and 2003. METHODS: We obtained statewide cancer registry and California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) EPHT data for almost 3 million non-Hispanic white women age 45 to 74 years, residing in California's 58 counties. We examined trends in the age-adjusted incidence of invasive female breast cancer and compared these with trends in the use of EPHT, after grouping all California counties into three groups based on EPHT use in 2001.
