Here, we assessed the relationship between basal total and activated (pY1068) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels in a tumor and the responsiveness to cetuximab monotherapy or combination-based treatment using human xenograft models. Cetuximab treatment alone (0.25-1 mg/mouse/injection, q3d, i.p.) effectively delayed the growth of GEO and L2987 tumors by a minimum of 10 days corresponding to log cell kill values of >or=1.0. Borderline activity was seen in the A549 and WiDr xenografts.
