Abstract OBJECTIVE: Dietary starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine may be quantitatively more important than dietary fiber as a substrate for fermentation. The products of fermentation have important implications in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and other diseases of the large bowel, which are uncommon in Africans but have a high prevalence in Western populations. METHODS: Maize porridge is a staple of most blacks in South Africa.
