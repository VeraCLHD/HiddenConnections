LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated the presence of genistin (genistein 7-O-glucoside) as the major isoflavone metabolite in the transgenic plants. Substantial amounts of genistin (up to 90 nmol/g FW) were found in leaves, while the levels were marginally detectable (less than 0.5 nmol/g FW) in fruit peels. In either case, no drastic variations in endogenous phenolic contents were observed.
