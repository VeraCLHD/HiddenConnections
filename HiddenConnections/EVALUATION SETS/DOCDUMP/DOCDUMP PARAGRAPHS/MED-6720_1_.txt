Objective: Our objective was to determine whether vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or increased the catabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Subjects and Design: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of healthy adults ages 18â€“84 yr who received placebo, 1000 IU vitamin D3, 1000 IU vitamin D2, or 500 IU vitamin D2 plus 500 IU vitamin D3 daily for 11 wk at the end of the winter. Results: Sixty percent of the healthy adults were vitamin D deficient at the start of the study.
