Neither vitamin E (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97–1.18; P=0.15) nor vitamin C (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.97–1.18; P=0.16) had a significant effect on total mortality, but vitamin E was associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.04–2.91; P=0.036). Conclusions In this large, long-term trial of male physicians, neither vitamin E nor C supplementation reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events. These data provide no support for the use of these supplements for the prevention of CVD in middle-aged and older men.
