The observed decrease in MAO activity in smokers is presumably due to their exposure to tobacco constituents that possess MAO-inhibiting properties. The inhibition of MAO activity seems, however, not to be a unique feature of tobacco smoking as subjects with Type II alcoholism have been reported to show a similar decrease in MAO activity that reverses when they cease to use alcohol. The present review summarizes the data on MAO-inhibiting tobacco constituents and explains that the decrease in MAO activity observed in alcoholics is probably due to concomitant tobacco use.
