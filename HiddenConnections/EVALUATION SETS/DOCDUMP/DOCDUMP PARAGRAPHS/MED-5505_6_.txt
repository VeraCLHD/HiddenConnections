Insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor α, and interleukin 6 decreased across omega-3 PUFA tertiles among the Health 2000 survey participants. Among the Fishermen study men, insulin resistance and arterial stiffness indicated by β-stiffness index tended to increase and the RR estimate for carotid artery plaque tended to decrease across tertiles of PCDD/F+PCB and MeHg. CONCLUSION: Previously established hypotriglyceridemic and anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFAs were seen also in this study.
