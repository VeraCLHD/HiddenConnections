The downstream targets regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for inhibiting adipocyte differentiation or cancer cell proliferation of curcumin were investigated. The activation of AMPK by curcumin was crucial for the inhibition of differentiation or growth in both adipocytes and cancer cells. Stimulation of AMPK by curcumin resulted in the down-regulation of PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor)-gamma in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the decrease in COX-2 in MCF-7 cells.
