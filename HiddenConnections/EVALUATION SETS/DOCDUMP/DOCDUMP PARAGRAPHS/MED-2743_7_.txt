A mixed-meal challenge test was performed before and after each period. RESULTS Ten patients completed the study and had the following characteristics: age, 53.2 years (95% CI, 48.0–58.4); BMI, 51.2 kg/m2 (46.1–56.4); diabetes duration, 7.4 years (4.8–10.0); and HbA1c, 8.52% (7.08–9.96). Patients lost 7.3 kg (8.1–6.5) during the presurgery period versus 4.0 kg (6.2–1.7) during the postsurgery period (P = 0.01 between periods).
