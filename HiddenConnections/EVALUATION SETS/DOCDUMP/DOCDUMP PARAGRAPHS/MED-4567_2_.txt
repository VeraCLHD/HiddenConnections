METHODS: Cases were 326 incident pancreatic cancer cases and controls 652 frequency-matched controls admitted to hospital for non-neoplastic diseases. Dietary information was collected through a validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and major recognized risk factors for pancreatic cancer were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of pancreatic cancer for each dietary pattern.
