Abstract In 1976 an article co-authored by Linus Pauling described that 100 terminal cancer patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, followed by oral maintenance, lived four times longer than a control group of 1,000 patients who did not receive vitamin C. The study was strongly criticized because the control group was very different from the group treated with vitamin C. The latter were declared terminally ill much sooner than the control group thus resulting in an artificially longer survival for the vitamin C group.
