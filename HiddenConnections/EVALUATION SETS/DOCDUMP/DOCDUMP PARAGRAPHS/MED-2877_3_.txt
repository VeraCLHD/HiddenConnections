Vegetable protein comprised 100% of the vegans' daily protein intake and 64% of the lactovegetarians', both significantly higher than the omnivores' (32%). Vegans and lactovegetarians also ate more carbohydrate and fibre than omnivores, although fat intake was similar. Mean GFR was significantly lower in the vegans than in the omnivores (100 +/- 13 vs. 113 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.04) and was intermediate in the lactovegetarians (105 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2).
