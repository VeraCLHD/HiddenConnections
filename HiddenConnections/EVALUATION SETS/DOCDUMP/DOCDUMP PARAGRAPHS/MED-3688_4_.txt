METHODS: A retrospective review of LSG performed from March 2008 through February 2011 by a single surgeon at King Saud University Hospitals, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, included 108 patients aged 5 through 21 years. RESULTS: Patients attending follow-up visits at 3 (n = 88), 6 (n = 76), 12 (n = 41), and 24 (n = 8) months postoperatively experienced median excess weight loss (EWL) of 28.9%, 48.1%, 61.3%, and 62.3%, respectively. At 6 and 12 months follow-up, 42.1% (n = 32) and 73.2% (n = 30) of patients achieved at least 50% EWL, whereas 7.9% (n = 6) and 4.9% (n = 2) had 25% or less EWL, respectively.
