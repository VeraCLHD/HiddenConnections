We provide a systematic review of clinical trials (CTs) related to DED treatment and a critical appraisal of CT public databases. CT reports obtained from eight databases were reviewed, as well as public free-access electronic databases for CT registration. Data evaluation was based on endpoints such as symptoms, Schirmer test, ocular surface staining scores, recruitment of patients, type and efficacy of the drug, and the design and site of performance of the study.
