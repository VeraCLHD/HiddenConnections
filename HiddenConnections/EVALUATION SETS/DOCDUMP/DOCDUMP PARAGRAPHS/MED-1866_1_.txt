Previous studies have shown that p21 and histone hyperacetylation are important in basal growth inhibition by butyrate. This study was designed to elucidate other mechanism underlying the butyrate effects on cell growth. METHODS: HT-29 colon carcinoma cells (standard medium or medium lacking serum) were treated with sodium butyrate (NaBu), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or both.
