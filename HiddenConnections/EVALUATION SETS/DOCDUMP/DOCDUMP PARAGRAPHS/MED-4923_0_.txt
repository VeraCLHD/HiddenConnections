Abstract Co-mutagenic beta-carbolines, such as norharman and harman, were quantified in mainstream and sidestream smoke condensates of six Japanese brands of cigarettes, and also in 13 kinds of cooked foods, using a combination of blue cotton treatment and HPLC. Norharman and harman were detected in all the cigarette smoke condensate samples. Their levels in the mainstream smoke case were 900-4240 ng per cigarette for norharman, and 360-2240 ng for harman, and in sidestream smoke, 4130-8990 ng for norharman and 2100-3000 ng for harman.
