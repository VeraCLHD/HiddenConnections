After each intervention, FMD, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and blood pressure were measured. RESULTS: FMD was significantly greater (P = 0.001) with the LS diet (4.89 +/- 2.42%) than with the US diet (3.37 +/- 2.10%), systolic blood pressure was significantly (P = 0.02) lower with the LS diet (112 +/- 11 mm Hg) than with the US diet (117 +/- 13 mm Hg), and 24-h sodium excretion was significantly lower (P = 0.0001) with the LS diet (64.1 +/- 41.3 mmol) than with the US diet (156.3 +/- 56.7 mmol). There was no correlation between change in FMD and change in 24-h sodium excretion or change in blood pressure.
