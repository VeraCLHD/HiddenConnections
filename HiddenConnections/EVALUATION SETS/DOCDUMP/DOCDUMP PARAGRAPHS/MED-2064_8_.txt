Respective numbers for anti-H-25 were 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2%. Tritiated 8-PN was synthesized yielding a 3H-tracer of high specific radioactivity (2.22 GBq/mg). A radioimmunoassay using anti-H-25 and 3H-8-PN was established and used for the quantitative determination of 8-PN in various beer brands and in the urine of six men after the consumption of three different brands of beer.
