The typical gluten‑related allergic disorder is the wheat allergy (WA). Celiac disease (CD) is a well‑known gluten‑related autoimmune condition. The clinical expression of a gluten‑related nonallergic and nonautoimmune response is nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), an emerging condition whose framework is yet unclear and whose diagnosis is suggested only by demonstration of gluten‑dependency in patient' symptoms after exclusion of WA and CD.
