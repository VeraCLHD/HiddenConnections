Abstract Endothelial dysfunction is considered an important prognostic factor in atherosclerosis. To determine the long-term association of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in healthy subjects, we prospectively assessed brachial FMD in 618 consecutive healthy subjects with no apparent heart disease, 387 men (63%), and mean age 54 ± 11 years. After overnight fasting and discontinuation of all medications for ≥12 hours, FMD was assessed using high-resolution linear array ultrasound.
