The PRAL per 100 g of each food was calculated considering its mineral and protein composition, the mean intestinal absorption rate for each nutrient and the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. The PRAL/100 g of each main food category was then calculated considering the frequency of the most represented (up to six) foods in the respective food group and the PRAL/100 g of each food. Subsequently the PRAL/100 g value for each main food category was adjusted for the standard serving size.
