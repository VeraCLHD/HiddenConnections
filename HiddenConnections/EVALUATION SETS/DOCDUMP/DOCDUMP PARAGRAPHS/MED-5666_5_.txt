Concentrations of vitamin B12, HCB and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180) were lower in the macrobiotic group. After adjustment for confounding variables, meat and fish consumption, but not dairy products, contributed to vitamin B12 concentrations. Meat and diary products strongly contributed to breast-milk concentrations of dieldrin and PCBs, fish to PCB 118, and smoking to DDT and dieldrin.
