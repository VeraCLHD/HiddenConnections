The endogenous NOC index and dietary nitrite were not significantly associated with cancer risk. There was a significant interaction between plasma vitamin C concentrations and dietary NDMA intake on cancer incidence (P for interaction < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary NOC (NDMA) was associated with a higher gastrointestinal cancer incidence, specifically of rectal cancer.
