MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Energy intake and ratings of hunger, satiety, and food characteristics were measured. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Outcomes were analyzed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. RESULTS: Compared with having no first course, consuming the low-energy-dense salads reduced meal energy intake (by 7% for the small portion and 12% for the large), and consuming the high-energy-dense salads increased intake (by 8% for the small portion and 17% for the large).
