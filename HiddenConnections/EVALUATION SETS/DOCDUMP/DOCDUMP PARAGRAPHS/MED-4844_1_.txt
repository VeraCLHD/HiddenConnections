In the present study, the use of these cells and peripheral lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluation of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) with comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis, or SCGE) is reported. This technique detects DNA strand breaks in individual cells in alkaline conditions. Thirteen volunteers were requested to rinse their mouths with 0.12% CHX solution for 18 days.
