Abstract The use of a neutropenic diet (ND) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was instituted more than 30 years ago as a means of preventing infection from organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. Evidence supporting this practice is lacking, however, and the actual efficacy of the ND remains unknown. Institutional policy at Northwestern Memorial Hospital discontinued the use of ND in 2006.
