Abstract Among the endocrine factors associated with breast cancer, estrogens are considered to play a central role in human breast carcinogenesis. Breast cancer risks are increased by long-term exposure to estrogens. Zeranol (Ralgro) is a nonsteroidal agent with estrogenic activity that is used as a growth promoter in the U.S. beef and veal industry.
