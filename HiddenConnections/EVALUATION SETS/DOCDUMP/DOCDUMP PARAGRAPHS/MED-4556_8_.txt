No clear overall associations between intakes of total protein or any of the subgroups and changes in WC were present. The associations showed some heterogeneity between centres, but pooling of estimates was still considered justified. CONCLUSION: A high intake of protein was not found associated with lower weight or waist gain in this observational study.
