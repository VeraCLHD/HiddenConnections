It is now apparent that there are two distinct subpopulations of people and that "bacterio-typing" individuals for their ability to make equol may hold the clue to the effectiveness of soy protein diets in the treatment or prevention of hormone-dependent conditions. In reviewing the history of equol, its biological properties, factors influencing its formation and clinical data, we propose a new paradigm. The clinical effectiveness of soy protein in cardiovascular, bone and menopausal health may be a function of the ability to biotransform soy isoflavones to the more potent estrogenic isoflavone, equol.
