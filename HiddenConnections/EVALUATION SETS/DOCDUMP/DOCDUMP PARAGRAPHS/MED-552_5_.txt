There was essentially no reclassification improvement with adding LDLNMR particle concentration or apolipoprotein B100 to a model that already included the total/HDL cholesterol ratio and non-lipid risk factors (net reclassification index [NRI], 0% and 1.9%, respectively), nor did the addition of either variable result in a statistically significant improvement in the c-index. Conclusions In this prospective study of healthy women, CVD risk prediction associated with lipoprotein profiles evaluated by NMR was comparable but not superior to standard lipids or apolipoproteins.
