Abstract We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acid treatment of major depressive disorder in order to determine efficacy and to examine sources of heterogeneity between trials. PubMED (1965-May 2010) was searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids for major depressive disorder. Our primary outcome measure was standardized mean difference in a clinical measure of depression severity.
