Lipid peroxides were detected using a PeroxiDetect kit (Sigma). PhIP increased the production of lipid peroxides and DAS decreased the PhIP-induced peroxidation by 47%. To determine if PhIP causes DNA strand breaks in MCF-10A cells, cells were treated for 3, 6, 9, and 24 h with PhIP (100 microM), DAS (100 microM) and a combination of PhIP (100 microM) and DAS (100 microM).
