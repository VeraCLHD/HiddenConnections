Abstract Moses Maimonides (1135-1204), physician and philosopher, was the greatest Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages. Faced with a life of persecution, exile, and tragedy, Maimonides overcame obstacles to become the leading physician in his era, a clinician whose skills were sought across continents. Despite long days caring for patients, Maimonides wrote extensively about both medicine and philosophy.
