This dilemma imposed by the gut environment has probably contributed significantly to the evolutionary drive that has led to sophisticated mechanisms and diversification of the immune system to allow for protection while maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier. The immense expansion and specialization of the immune system is particularly mirrored in the phylogeny, ontogeny, organization, and regulation of the adaptive intraepithelial lymphocytes, or IEL, which are key players in the unique intestinal defense mechanisms that have evolved in mammals.
