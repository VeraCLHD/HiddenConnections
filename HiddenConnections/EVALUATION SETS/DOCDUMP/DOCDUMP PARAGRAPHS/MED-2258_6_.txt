Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, intracavernosal injection of vasoactive agents and vacuum erection devices are options which can be used in a rehabilitation program. Penile implants should be considered if patients do not respond to medical therapies. To facilitate informed decision making, patients should be presented with all treatment options, and told that rehabilitation and treatment for ED as early as possible after prostate cancer therapy will result in faster and better recovery of erectile function and preserve sexual continuity.
