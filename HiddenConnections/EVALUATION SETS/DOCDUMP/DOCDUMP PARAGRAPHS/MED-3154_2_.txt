The mechanisms by which this balance is achieved are relatively unknown. Here, we identify a bacterial metabolite, n-butyrate, that exerts immunomodulatory effects on intestinal macrophages and renders them hyporesponsive to commensals that reside in the colon. Our studies elucidate a possible mechanism that contributes to immune homeostasis in the intestines.
