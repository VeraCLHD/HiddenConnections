In epidemiological studies, smoking and high serum cholesterol levels were found to have the most consistent associations with DD and LBP. CONCLUSION: Aortic atherosclerosis and stenosis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine were associated with DD and LBP. Cardiovascular risk factors had weaker associations, being clearly apparent only in cohorts on elderly people or in large study samples.
