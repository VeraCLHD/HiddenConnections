We questioned whether supplementation with the vitamin influenced body weight and composition. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on high-quality, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had supplemented vitamin D without imposing any caloric restriction. Eighteen trials reporting either body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), percentage fat mass (%FM) or lean body mass (LBM) met our criteria.
