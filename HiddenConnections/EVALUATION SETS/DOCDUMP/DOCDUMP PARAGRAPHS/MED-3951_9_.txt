The presence of CCs using SEM and confocal microscopy was similar, suggesting that CC perforation can occur in vivo at 37 degrees C. All patients with acute coronary syndrome had perforating CCs, but none was present in patients without acute coronary syndrome (p = 0.0001). For all plaques, there were strong associations of CCs with PD, thrombus, symptoms (p <0.0001), and plaque size (p <0.02). Crystal content was an independent predictor of thrombus and symptoms.
