For rectal cancer alone (only 71 cases), significant (p less than 0.05) protective effects were observed for high intakes of protein (OR = 0.61), fibre (OR = 0.46), beta-carotene (OR = 0.54), cruciferous vegetables (OR = 0.51) and total vegetables (OR = 0.51). When further assessed by multiple logistic regression, tests for trend and assessment of risk in the extreme highest and lowest quintiles of the control range, the factors consistently significant were cruciferous vegetable intake and the meat/vegetable ratio. A particularly high relative risk was also noted in association with low coffee consumption (OR = 1.59, with p less than 0.05 for trend).
