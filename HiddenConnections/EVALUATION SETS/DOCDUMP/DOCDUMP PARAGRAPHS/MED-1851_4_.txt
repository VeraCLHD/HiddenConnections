INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Volunteers had the following dietary intakes of carbohydrate (g/d; mean +/- s.d.); starch 131 +/- 41 (including resistant starch (RS), 5 +/- 2), sugar 108 +/- 37 and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) 14 +/- 7. Daily faecal output was 127 +/- 70 g and transit time 47 +/- 19 h. Analysis of faecal samples found 0.8 +/- 1.2 g RS and significant relationship with the concentration (mmol/L) of butyrate excreted n faeces (r = 0.34, P < 0.05).
