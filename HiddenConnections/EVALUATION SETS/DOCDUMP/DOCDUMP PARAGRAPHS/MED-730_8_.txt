Several mTORC1 substrates are now known, although in several cases their physiological roles are poorly or incompletely understood. In the case of several processes, although it is clear that they are regulated by mTORC1, it is not known how mTORC1 does this. Lastly, mTORC1 is implicated in ageing, but again it is unclear what mechanisms account for this.
