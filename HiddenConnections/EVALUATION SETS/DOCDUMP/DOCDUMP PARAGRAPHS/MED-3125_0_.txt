Abstract We studied the effects of four calcium-rich foodstuffs on postprandial parathyroid hormone secretion. Four hundred milligrams calcium from either Emmental cheese, milk, sesame seeds, spinach, or calcium salt (calcium lactate gluconate + calcium carbonate) or no additional calcium (control session) were given to nine female volunteers immediately after a first blood sample (at 0900) in random order with a light standardized meal containing 37 mg Ca. Blood samples were taken at 0900 (before the calcium load), 1000, 1100, 1300, and 1500 at every study session.
