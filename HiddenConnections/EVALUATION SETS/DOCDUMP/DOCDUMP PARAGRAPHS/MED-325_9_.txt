The inverse association between fiber intake and RCC was consistent among participants who never smoked, had a body mass index [BMI (in kg/m2)] <30, and did not report a history of diabetes or hypertension. Conclusions: Intake of fiber and fiber-rich plant foods was associated with a significantly lower risk of RCC in this large US cohort.
