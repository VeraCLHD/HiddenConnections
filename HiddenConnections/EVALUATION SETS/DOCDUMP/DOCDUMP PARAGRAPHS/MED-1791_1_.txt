In several published studies, viruses such as human mammary tumor virus, human papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and measles virus have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a subset of breast cancers (BC). However, these studies have produced conflicting results, causing considerable controversy. In this context, recent demonstration of elevated levels of mutagenic antiviral enzyme APOBEC3B in a majority of BCs is a highly significant development, as it provides a possible mechanism for development of large numbers of mutations (kataegis) that characterize many of the BCs.
