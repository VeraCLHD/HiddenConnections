Rhodamine 123 staining showed significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by HN and HA. HN and HA induced DNA damage was confirmed by comet tail formation. Lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS) and protein oxidation marker (PCC) were significantly elevated in HN and HA treated groups.
