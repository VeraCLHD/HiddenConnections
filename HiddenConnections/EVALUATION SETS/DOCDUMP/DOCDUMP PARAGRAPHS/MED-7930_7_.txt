Whole-grain intake was significantly higher in normal weight students than in overweight and obese students (based on BMI). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The low intake of whole grains in this population of college students indicates the need for interventions aiming to increase whole-grain intake to the recommended minimum of 3 servings per day. College students who are concerned about their body weight may be motivated to increase their intake of whole-grain foods; however, their intake of whole grains is likely to be influenced by the availability of these food items in campus dining halls and other locations around the college campus.
