Less than 3.8% of the men and 0.8% of the women had GGT greater than or equal to 50 U/l. The low level of GGT matched well with the low mortality of cirrhosis and the modest use of alcohol in Norway. Multiple regression analysis for each sex showed a strong positive association with body mass index, use of alcohol and, unexpectedly, a negative association with coffee consumption, whereas serum triglycerides and the time since the last meal showed a weaker positive association.
