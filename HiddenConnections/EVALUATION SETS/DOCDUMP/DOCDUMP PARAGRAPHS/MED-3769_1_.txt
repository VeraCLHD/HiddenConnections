To our knowledge, only five case reports are available in the literature wherein the parasites were surgically removed from the vitreous cavity and the species were identified. In this report, we document the clinical features of intravitreal gnathostomiasis along with the route of entry and parasitic migration pattern in ocular tissue, surgical management, and electron microscopic features of the retrieved advanced third-stage larva of Gnathostoma spinigerum (aL3) for a 48-year-old Indian woman with excellent postsurgical visual recovery.
