Endothelial cell phenotypes are differentially regulated in space and time. Endothelial cell heterogeneity has important implications for developing strategies in basic research, diagnostics and therapeutics. The goals of this review are to: (i) consider mechanisms of endothelial cell heterogeneity; (ii) discuss the bench-to-bedside gap in endothelial biomedicine; (iii) revisit definitions for endothelial cell activation and dysfunction; and (iv) propose new goals in diagnosis and therapy.
