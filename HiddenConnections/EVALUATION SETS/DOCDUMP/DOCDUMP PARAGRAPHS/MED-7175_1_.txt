Poultry is the most common source of C. jejuni infection in industrialized countries, including the US. There are no data on the prevalence on consumer poultry products of various strains of C. jejuni, including those hypothesized to be associated with neuropathy. To study this, C. jejuni was isolated from fresh broiler chicken products purchased from grocery stores in the Baltimore area.
