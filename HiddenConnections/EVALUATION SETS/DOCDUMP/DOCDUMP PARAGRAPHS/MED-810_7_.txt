The results from GAM suggest a plateau after 35 years of smoking or 10 cigarette-equivalent pack-years for both cigarette and bidi. The OR is 4.54 (95%CI=2.96-6.95) and 6.45 (95%CI=4.38-9.50) for more than 30 years of cigarette-only and bidi-only smoking, respectively, and 6.87 (95%CI=4.62-10.2) and 10.7 (95%CI=5.82-19.6) for more than 12 weighted cumulative cigarette-only and bidi-only consumption, respectively. The lung cancer risk of former cigarette smokers drops down more quickly after quitting smoking compared to former bidi smokers.
