Blood was drawn before and after exercise, leucocytes were quantified and key lymphocyte cell surface markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Results Exercise decreased spirometry only in children with asthma, but increased (p<0.001) most types of leucocytes (eg lymphocytes (controls, mean (SD) 1210 (208) cells/μl; children with asthma, 1119 (147) cells/μl) and eosinophils (controls, 104 (22) cells/μl; children with asthma, 88 (20) cells/μl)) to the same degree in both groups. Similarly, exercise increased T helper cells (controls, 248 (60) cells/μl; children with asthma, 232 (53) cells/μl) and most other lymphocyte subtypes tested.
