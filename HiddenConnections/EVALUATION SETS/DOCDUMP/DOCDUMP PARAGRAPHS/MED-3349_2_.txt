The meals were served in the morning, after an overnight fast, to ten healthy male volunteers. Satiety was registered and blood glucose as well as plasma insulin and C-peptide were analysed at regular intervals until 3.5 h postprandially. The largest spinach portions augmented satiety and reduced the postprandial glucose response.
