Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and after 3.2 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) years to assess changes in mean minimum coronary artery diameter and mean percent stenosis. RESULTS: Compared to lower intakes, > 3 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal) of cereal fiber or > 6 servings of whole grains per week were associated with smaller decline in minimum coronary artery diameter (cereal fiber: -0.09 +/- 0.02 vs -0.04 +/- 0.02 mm, P = .03; whole grains: -0.10 +/- 0.02 vs -0.06 +/- 0.02 mm, P = .04) after adjustments for age, cardiovascular risk factors, and dietary intakes of saturated and polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, and alcohol. Progression in percent stenosis tended to be less in women with higher intake of cereal fiber (P = .10) or whole-grain foods (P = .09), after similar adjustments.
