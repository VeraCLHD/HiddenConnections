Median plasma genistein values in the control group were 31.9 ng/mL for the lowest and 353.9 ng/mL for the highest quartile groups. Regarding dietary intake of isoflavones, nonsignificant inverse associations were observed for both genistein and daidzein. CONCLUSION: This nested case-control study found an inverse association between plasma genistein and the risk of breast cancer in Japan.
