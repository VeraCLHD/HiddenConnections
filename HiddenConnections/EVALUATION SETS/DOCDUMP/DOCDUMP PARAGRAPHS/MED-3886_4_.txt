TEQ also increased by up to 980%, to a maximum concentration of 28 Î¼g kg(-1) in PCNB, but did not change in the 2,4-D formulation. Assuming similar yields as observed in the present study as a worst case scenario the use of PCNB in Australia may result in the formation of 155 g TEQ annum(-1), contributed primarily by OCDD formation. This warrants detailed evaluations on the contemporary release of PCDD/Fs to the environment after the use of pesticides.
