Ability to detect odors was generally intact in most control subjects, however, we found that the abilities of individuals in the three different patient populations to recognize odors were impaired relative to control subjects. All three types of patients exhibited decreased or impaired odor-recognition compared with age-matched controls. Previous studies showed the causes of olfactory impairments in PD and AD patients were attributable to pathological changes and MRI signal abnormalities in limbic areas, including the amygdala (AMG), entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).
