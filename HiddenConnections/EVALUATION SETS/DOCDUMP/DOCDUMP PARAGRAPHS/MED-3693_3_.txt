The primary focus of the study was safety; however, the authors also received approval to collect data on early efficacy including weight change and energy metabolism. RESULTS: No serious adverse effects, including detrimental psychological consequences, were observed with continuous LHA DBS after a mean follow-up of 35 months (range 30-39 months). Three-dimensional nonlinear transformation of postoperative imaging superimposed onto brain atlas anatomy was used to confirm and study DBS contact proximity to the LHA.
