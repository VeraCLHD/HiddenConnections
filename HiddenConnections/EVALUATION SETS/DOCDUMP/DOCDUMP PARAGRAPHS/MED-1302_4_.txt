Methods Children with mild–moderate persistent asthma and age‐matched controls (n = 14 in each group, mean age 13.6 years) performed a 6‐min bout of cycle‐ergometer exercise. Spirometry was performed at baseline and after exercise. Blood was drawn before and after exercise, leucocytes were quantified and key lymphocyte cell surface markers were assessed by flow cytometry.
