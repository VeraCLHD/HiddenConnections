We hypothesize that the combination of alcohol consumption with UV radiation can potentiate the skin carcinogenic effects through the intermediate biproducts or metabolites of alcohol, which serve as the photosensitizers, consequently enhancing the cellular damage. We have proposed a mechanism that explains the combined alcohol-UV radiation carcinogenicity and its potential involvement in enhancing skin damage in the multistep skin carcinogenesis process. Previous literature has explored this mutual effect but no studies have definitively ascribed the reasons for increased skin cancer prevalence among alcohol drinkers.
