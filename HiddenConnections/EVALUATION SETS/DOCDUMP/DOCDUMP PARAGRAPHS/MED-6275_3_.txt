Selective inhibition of MAO-A by clorgyline results in a large increase in the amount of unchanged tyramine transported, whereas selective inhibition of MAO-B with L-deprenyl (selegiline) has no significant effect. The behavior of reversible MAO-A inhibitors can significantly reduce, but not entirely eliminate, these effects on the intestinal metabolism of tyramine, but only if the inhibition is competitive in nature.
