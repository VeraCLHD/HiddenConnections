Crude OR and adjusted OR were determined by multinomial and logistic regression in cross-sectional and prospective analyses, respectively. Participants were predominantly African American (85.5%) aged 25.3 ± 6.8 y (mean ± SD). Per 10-unit increase, GL was positively (adjusted OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00–1.03) and NNR was negatively (adjusted OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88–0.99) associated with BV compared to normal vaginal flora.
