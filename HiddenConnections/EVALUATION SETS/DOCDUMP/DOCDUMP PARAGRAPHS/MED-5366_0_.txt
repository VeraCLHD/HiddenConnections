Abstract Because of recent studies indicating possible embryolethality and teratogenicity of FD&C Red No. 2, and ad hoc committee was convened by the Food and Drug Administration to consider these questions. The committee suggested a collaborative study by three laboratories [Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT), and National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR)] in which Red No. 2 was given at 200 mg/kg body weight, by gavage during days 0-19, 6-15, or 7-9 of gestation. FD&C Red No. 2 was also given at the same dose level via water bottle.
