Design: We investigated cross-sectional associations of brachial artery measures with fish intake (ascertained with a food-frequency questionnaire) and plasma phospholipid omega-3 concentrations in 3045 adults, aged 45â€“84 y, who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease. Results: In overall multivariate-adjusted analyses, there were no significant associations between fish intake or any brachial artery measures. However, when stratified by sex, there was an association between the highest quartile of nonfried fish consumption and a 0.10-mm lower (1 SD) brachial artery diameter in men (P = 0.01) and a 0.27% smaller FMD in women (P = 0.02) compared with the lowest quartile of nonfried fish intake in each respective sex strata.
