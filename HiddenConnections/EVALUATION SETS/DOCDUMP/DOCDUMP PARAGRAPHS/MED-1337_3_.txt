In vitro naringin was a potent competitive inhibitor of caffeine 3-demethylation by human liver microsomes (Ki = 7-29 microM). 3. In vivo grapefruit juice (1.2 l day-1 containing 0.5 g l-1 naringin, the glycone form of naringenin) decreased the oral clearance of caffeine by 23% (95% CI: 7%-30%) and prolonged its half-life by 31% (95% CI: 20%-44%) (n = 12).
