Fasting concentrations of blood variables at 0, 6, and 12 weeks were compared to assess chronic intake of Str or Pbo. RESULTS: After the HFM during the run-in period, TG and OxLDL were lower after Str than Pbo (p = 0.005, p = 0.01, and p = 0.0008, respectively). HFM responses after 6 weeks of Str versus Pbo resulted in decreased lipid levels and a sex by treatment interaction for OxLDL (p = < 0.0001, and p = 0.0002).
