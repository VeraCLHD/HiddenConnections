Furthermore, we show that zeranol and estradiol-17beta have a similar potency in the stimulation and inhibition of gene expressions in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by RT-PCR. These results indicate that both zeranol and estradiol-17beta can induce human breast epithelial cell neoplastic transformation with similar potency in the long-term exposure through the oxidation-reduction (redox) pathway and/or ER-beta-mediated pathway.
