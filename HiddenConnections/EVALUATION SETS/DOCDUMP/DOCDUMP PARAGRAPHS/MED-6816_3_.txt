During the initial 4-week Program A (control), participants consumed a modified US Department of Agriculture food pyramid diet and a rice protein powder supplement that provided basic macronutrient support. During the second 4-week Program B (intervention), participants consumed a modified elimination diet and a phytonutrient-rich medical food. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, both programs showed trends toward lower mean FIQ total score, MSQ total score, and FibroQuest total score, FIQ stiffness score, and FibroQuest headaches score.
