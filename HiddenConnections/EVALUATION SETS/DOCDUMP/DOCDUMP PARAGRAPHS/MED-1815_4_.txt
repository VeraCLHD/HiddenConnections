RESULTS: Whole brain and intracranial space grew by 25%-27% between early childhood (mean age, 26 months; age range, 19-33 months) and adolescence (mean age, 14 years; age range, 12-15 years); thereafter, whole-brain volume decreased such that volunteers (age range, 71-80 years) had volumes similar to those of young children. GM increased 13% from early to later (6-9 years) childhood. Thereafter, GM increased more slowly and reached a plateau in the 4th decade; it decreased by 13% in the oldest volunteers.
