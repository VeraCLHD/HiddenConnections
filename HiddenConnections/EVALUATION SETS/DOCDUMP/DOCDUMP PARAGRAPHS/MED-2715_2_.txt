We identified two meta-analyses, two systematic reviews, eleven placebo-controlled trials, five observational studies, forty-five case-control studies, thirty autopsy and five uncontrolled studies, and one case report. There were eleven interventional trials that tried to either supplement or deplete Fe and Cu, but none of them provided clear evidence of a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in patients with AD. The prospective studies revealed an association between a diet simultaneously high in SFA and Cu and cognitive decline.
