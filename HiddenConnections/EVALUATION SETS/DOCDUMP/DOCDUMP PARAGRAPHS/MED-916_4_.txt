In a mean clinical follow-up of 4.6 ± 1.8 years, the composite CV events (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or angina pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary interventions) were significantly more common in subjects with FMD ≤11.3% rather than >11.3% (15.2% vs 1.2%, p = 0.0001, respectively). Univariate analysis demonstrated that the median FMD significantly predicted CV events (odds ratio 2.78, 95% CI 1.35 to 5.71, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis, controlling for traditional CV risk factors, demonstrated that median FMD was the best independent predictor of long-term CV adverse events (odds ratio 2.93, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.68, p <0.001).
