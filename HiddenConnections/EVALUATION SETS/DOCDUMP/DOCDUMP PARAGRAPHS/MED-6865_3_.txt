First, samples were collected from tonsils, caecum with caecal contents, and the caecal lymph nodes of 60 slaughter pigs. These samples were used to compare the sensitivity of six different laboratory culture methods either in common use or described in the literature with that of a polymerase chain reaction with two primer pairs (multiplex PCR). Then, only PCR was used to examine tonsils, caecum and caecal lymph nodes from two groups of slaughter pigs: 210 from six conventional fattening farms and 200 from three with alternative housing.
