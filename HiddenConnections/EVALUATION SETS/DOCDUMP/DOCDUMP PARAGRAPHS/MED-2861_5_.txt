RESULTS: Mean ± SD erythemal D(30) was significantly higher following tomato paste vs. control (baseline, 26·5 ± 7·5 mJ cm(-2); control, 23 ± 6·6 mJ cm(-2); tomato paste, 36·6 ± 14·7 mJ cm(-2); P = 0·03), while the MED was not significantly different between groups (baseline, 35·1 ± 9·9 mJ cm(-2); control, 32·6 ± 9·6 mJ cm(-2); tomato paste, 42·2 ± 11·3 mJ cm(-2)). Presupplementation, UVR induced an increase in MMP-1 (P = 0·01) and a reduction in fibrillin-1 (P = 0·03). Postsupplementation, UVR-induced MMP-1 was reduced in the tomato paste vs. control group (P = 0·04), while the UVR-induced reduction in fibrillin-1 was similarly abrogated in both groups, and an increase in pCI deposition was seen following tomato paste (P = 0·05).
