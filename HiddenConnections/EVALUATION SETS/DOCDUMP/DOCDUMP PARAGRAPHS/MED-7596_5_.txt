RESULTS: There were 147 (19%) statin users at baseline and 179 (23%) at follow-up. Longitudinal analyses revealed statin use at baseline predicted increased falls risk scores over 2.6 years (0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27) and a trend towards increased %ALM (0.45%, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.92). Statin users at both time points demonstrated decreased leg strength (-5.02 kg, 95% CI -9.65 to -0.40) and LMQ (-0.30 kg/kg, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.01), and trended towards increased falls risk (0.13, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.26) compared to controls.
