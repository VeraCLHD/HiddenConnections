Based on this evidence, we have developed sample weight-loss meal plans that include multiple satiating foods, which may collectively augment the satiating properties of a meal. Compared to a typical American diet, these meal plans are considerably lower in energy density and probably more satiating. A diet that exploits the satiating properties of multiple foods may help increase long-term dietary compliance and consequentially enhance weight loss.
