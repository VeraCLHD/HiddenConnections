Aortic involvement with fatty streaks was greater in blacks than in whites (37 vs. 17 percent, P less than 0.01). However, aortic fatty streaks were strongly related to antemortem levels of both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.67, P less than 0.0001 for each association), independently of race, sex, and age, and were inversely correlated with the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density plus very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.35, P = 0.06). Coronary-artery fatty streaks were correlated with very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.41, P = 0.04).
