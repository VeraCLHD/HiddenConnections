Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of visual impairment in working-age adults worldwide. Pan retinal photocoagulation (PRP) has provided an effective treatment to decrease the risk of severe vision loss in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy for the past four decades. Pattern scan laser (PASCAL) was developed to minimize the side effects of PRP.
