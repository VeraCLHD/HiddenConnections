The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between habitual physical exercise and telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women were chosen as study participants because they are typically estrogen deficient. METHODS: This experimental-control, cross-sectional study included 44 healthy, nondiabetic, nonsmoking, postmenopausal women.
