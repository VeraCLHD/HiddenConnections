Studies analyzing predictors for total colectomy and mortality after colectomy are limited by small numbers. STUDY DESIGN: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2001 to 2010 was retrospectively reviewed for CDC trends, the associated colectomy and mortality rates. Patient and hospital variables were used in the LASSO algorithm for logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation to build a predictive model for colectomy requirement and mortality after colectomy.
