We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies, aiming at a critical evaluation of the association between the development of PD and pesticide exposure. Reported effect sizes (ES) in the relevant studies were pooled into the meta-analysis to derive summary ES. The summary ES suggested a significantly positive association between PD and overall pesticide use (non-occupational and/or occupational pesticide use) [1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 1.52, the fixed-effects model], as well as between PD and occupational pesticide exposure (1.49 with a 95% CI of 1.34-1.66).
