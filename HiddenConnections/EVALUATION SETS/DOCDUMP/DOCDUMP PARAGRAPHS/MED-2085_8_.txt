Sodium excretion increased during the HS diet (P < 0.05). The plateau % CVCmax was reduced during HS (LS: 93 ± 1 % CVCmax vs. HS: 80 ± 2 % CVCmax; P < 0.05). During the HS diet, AA improved the plateau % CVCmax (Ringer: 80 ± 2 % CVCmax vs. AA: 89 ± 3 % CVCmax; P < 0.05) and restored the NO contribution (Ringer: 44 ± 3 % CVCmax vs. AA: 59 ± 6 % CVCmax; P < 0.05).
