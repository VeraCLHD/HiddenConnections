On the HCF diets, insulin therapy could be discontinued in nine patients receiving 15 to 20 units/day and in two patients receiving 32 units/day. Fasting and 3-hr postprandial plasma glucose values were lower in most patients on the HCF diets than on the control diets despite lower insulin doses. Serum cholesterol values dropped from 206 +/- 10 mg/dl on the control diets to 147 +/- 5 (P less than 0.001) on the HCF diet; average fasting serum triglyceride values were not significantly altered on the HCF diets.
