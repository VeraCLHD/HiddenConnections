Urinary sodium excretion in the fourth week of slow sodium was 162 +/- 9 mmol/24 h and that in the fourth week of placebo was 86 mmol +/- 9 mmol/24 h (p less than 0.001). There was no difference in potassium excretion. These results suggest that moderate sodium restriction achieved by not adding salt and avoiding sodium-laden foods should, if not already, become part of the management of essential hypertension.
