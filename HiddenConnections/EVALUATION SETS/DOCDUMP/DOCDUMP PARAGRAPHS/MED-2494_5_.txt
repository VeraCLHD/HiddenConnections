The degree of vessel disease has been related to the severity of neuropathy. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease develop the so called "hypoxic neuropathy" in which similar microvascular changes occur as in diabetic neuropathy. In rats with experimental diabetic neuropathy nerve blood flow is reduced and oxygen supplementation or vasodilator treatment improved the deterioration in conduction velocity and nerve blood flow.
