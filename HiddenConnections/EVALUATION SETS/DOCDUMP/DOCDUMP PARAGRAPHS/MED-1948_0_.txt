Abstract OBJECTIVE: Current treatment options for irritable bowel syndrome are limited and often poorly studied. A select few drugs have been studied in irritable bowel syndrome, and the number needed to treat is frequently used to assess the relative efficacy of these treatments. However, side effects are an important consideration in the clinical decision on which particular treatment to use.
