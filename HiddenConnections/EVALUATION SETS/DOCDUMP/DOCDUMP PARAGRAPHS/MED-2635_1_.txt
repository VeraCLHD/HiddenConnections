Objective: We hypothesized that consumption of nonfried fish and plasma phospholipid measures of long-chain omega-3 (n–3) fatty acids would be positively associated with larger FMD in men and women across racial-ethnic groups. Design: We investigated cross-sectional associations of brachial artery measures with fish intake (ascertained with a food-frequency questionnaire) and plasma phospholipid omega-3 concentrations in 3045 adults, aged 45–84 y, who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease. Results: In overall multivariate-adjusted analyses, there were no significant associations between fish intake or any brachial artery measures.
