RESULTS: Diet Coke was found to be the most acidic drink (pH 2.61), whereas Innocent(®) mangoes and passion fruit smoothie showed to be the least (pH 3.9). With regard to TA, Innocent(®) blackberries, strawberries, and blackcurrant smoothie had the highest TA requiring 10.8 mol of NaOH to reach pH 7.0, whereas citric acid required only 3.1 mol of NaOH to reach the same pH value. Surface profilometry and microhardness testing revealed that citric acid caused a statistically significantly greater tooth surface loss compared with smoothie after 21-day pH cycling protocol.
