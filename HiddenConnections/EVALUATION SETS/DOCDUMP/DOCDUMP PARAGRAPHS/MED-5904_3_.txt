Advancing age (yr) was positively associated with the proportion (%) of senescent (KLRG1+/CD57+; KLRG1+/CD28-) CD4+ (B=1.00; 1.02) and CD8+ (B=0.429; 1.02) T-cells and inversely associated with naïve (KLRG1-/CD28+) CD4+ (B=-1.000) and CD8+ (B=-0.993) T-cells. VO(2max) was inversely associated with senescent CD4+ (B=-0.97) and CD8+ (B=-0.240). Strikingly, age was no longer associated with the proportions of senescent or naïve T-cells after adjusting for VO(2max), while the association between VO(2max) and these T-cell subsets withstood adjustment for age, BMI and percentage body fat.
