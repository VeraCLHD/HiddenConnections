Abstract Exploring novel hydration indices is important because no human biomarker has been shown to be incontrovertibly valid in all life situations. The present investigation was designed to identify inexpensive, nontechnical methods to use when self-assessing hydration status. This investigation evaluated the validity and efficacy of 2 novel techniques (i.e., thirst sensation and urine volume) to assess hydration state of 29 active men (mean ± SD; age, 23 ± 4 years; body mass, 76.02 ± 11.94 kg) at rest.
