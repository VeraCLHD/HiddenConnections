CONCLUSIONS: HPV infections occur commonly and are usually cleared within 18 months, thus HPV infection should not be a cause for concern among monogamous couples with a rich and varied sex life as long as the sexual system remains closed and other immune compromising factors are not present. HPV becomes a concern in the context of immune system compromise and infection persistence. Factors contributing to immune system compromise, HPV persistence, and oncogenesis are reviewed.
