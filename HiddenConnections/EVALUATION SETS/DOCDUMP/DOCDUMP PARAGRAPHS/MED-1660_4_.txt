Of the total tissue recovered, between 10 and 15% originated from the first carcass, and between 7 and 61 mg was spinal cord tissue from the first carcass. At commercial plants in the United Kingdom, between 6 and 101 g of tissue was recovered from the saw, depending on the particular saw-washing procedure and number of carcasses processed. Therefore, if a carcass infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy were to enter the slaughter line, the main risk of subsequent carcass contamination would come from the tissue debris that accumulates in the splitting saw.
