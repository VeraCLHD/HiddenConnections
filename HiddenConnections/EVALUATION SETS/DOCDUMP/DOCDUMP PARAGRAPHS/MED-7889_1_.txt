In this review, we focused on studies with relatively complete assessment of dietary soy exposure in the targeted populations and appropriate consideration for potential confounders in the statistical analysis of study data. Meta-analysis of the 8 (1 cohort, 7 case–control) studies conducted in high-soy-consuming Asians show a significant trend of decreasing risk with increasing soy food intake. Compared to the lowest level of soy food intake (⩽5 mg isoflavones per day), risk was intermediate (OR=0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.78–0.98) among those with modest (∼10 mg isoflavones per day) intake and lowest (OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.60–0.85) among those with high intake (⩾20 mg isoflavones per day).
