Anti-estrogenic activities were also examined by estimating the suppression of cell proliferation in the presence of 10(-11) M 17beta-estradiol. Mono-n-pentyl phthalate (MPP), monocyclohexyl phthalate (MCHP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBZP), monoisopropyl phthalate (MIPrP) and BBP were suggested to have anti-estrogenic activities at higher than 10(-4) M. Among commonly used phthalate esters and those with related structures, some were found to be estrogenic and others were anti-estrogenic in vitro.
