As such, its expression in the periphery and in brain changes in response to changes in cholesterol metabolism. Here, we used a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis to examine whether the diet-induced or pharmacologically induced changes in plasma cholesterol that result in altered brain amyloidosis also affect ApoE content in liver and in brain. We found that chronic changes in total cholesterol in plasma lead to changes in ApoE mRNA levels in brain.
