At baseline, 108 patients (43% women) reported mild angina and 174 patients (37% women) reported limiting angina. By 12 weeks, 74% of these patients were angina free, and an additional 9% moved from limiting to mild angina. This improvement in angina was significant for patients with mild and limiting angina at baseline regardless of gender (p <0.01).
