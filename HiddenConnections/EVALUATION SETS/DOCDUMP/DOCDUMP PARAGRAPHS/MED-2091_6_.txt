Lack of aldosterone in the culture medium or treatment with the epithelial sodium channel inhibitor amiloride prevented this response. Nitric oxide formation was found down-regulated in cells cultured in aldosterone-containing high sodium medium. The results suggest that changes in plasma sodium concentration per se may affect endothelial function and thus control vascular tone.
