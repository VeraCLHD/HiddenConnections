Abstract This article reviews community-based salt intervention trials. In the Belgian Salt Intervention Trial, a controlled 5-y intervention in two Belgian towns resulted in a reduction in urinary sodium of 17 mmol/24 h (P < 0.001) in adult (aged > or = 20 y) women in the intervention town, which differed from the concurrent trend (an increase of 8 mmol/24 h) in the control town (P = 0.01). However, both systolic (-7.5 compared with -7.9 mm Hg) and diastolic (-2.3 compared with -3.0 mm Hg) pressures declined to the same extent in women of the two towns.
