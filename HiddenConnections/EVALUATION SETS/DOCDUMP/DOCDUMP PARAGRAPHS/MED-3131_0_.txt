Abstract Syncope is a common clinical problem characterized by transient, spontaneously self-terminating loss of consciousness with complete and prompt recovery; the cause is insufficiency of cerebral oxygen/nutrient supply most often due to a transient fall of systemic arterial pressure to levels below those tolerated by cerebrovascular autoregulation. Careful and thorough evaluation of the cause of syncope is warranted in all patients. Determining that certain individuals are at "low mortality risk" is inadequate; syncope, although often benign from a mortality perspective, tends to recur, is associated with risk of physical injury, diminishes quality-of-life, and might lead to restriction from employment or avocation.
