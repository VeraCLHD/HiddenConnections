Increasing consumption of drinking water is a strategy to reduce energy intake and lose or maintain weight; however, information on the characteristics of consumers who drink water is limited. Our objective was to describe the characteristics of people who have a low intake of drinking water and to determine associations between their behaviors and attitudes and their intake of water. Methods We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 3,397 US adults who participated in the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s 2007 Food Attitudes and Behaviors Survey.
