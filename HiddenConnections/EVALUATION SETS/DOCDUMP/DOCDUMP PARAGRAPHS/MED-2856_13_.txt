At transition, the first composite outcome occurred in 443/5107 and 444/5108 participants in the intensive and standard arms, respectively (p= 0.99), and the second outcome in 1591/5107 and 1659/5108 participants in intensive and standard arms (p=0.20). Results were similar at study end. Secondary measures at study end favoring intensive therapy (p<0.05) included development of macroalbuminuria, cataract extraction, visual acuity, a score of >2.0 on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, loss of ankle jerk and light touch.
