As a fixed-calorie (150 kcal) snack (Experiment 2), raisins reduced pizza intake, compared with water (âˆ¼11%, p = 0.005), and resulted in a cumulative intake similar to water; however, both grapes and the mixed snack resulted in higher cumulative intakes (p < 0.015). Appetite was lower after all caloric ad libitum snacks (p < 0.003) and after fixed amounts of grapes and the mixed snack (p < 0.037), compared with water. In conclusion, consumption of a premeal snack of raisins, but not grapes or a mix of raisins and almonds, reduces meal-time energy intake and does not lead to increased cumulative energy intake in children.
