Abstract The effect of meal volume and fat content on gastroesophageal reflux was investigated in 20 asymptomatic healthy subjects. In each subject, intraesophageal pH monitoring was performed during a 3-hr postprandial period (PP) in the same position (supine or upright) on two successive days. On day 1, 500-ml low- and high-fat meals were ingested and, on day 2, an 800-ml low-fat meal was ingested.
