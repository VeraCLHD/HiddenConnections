However, a weak risk reduction for CHD death was found among women with a higher intake of kaempferol, an individual flavonol found primarily in broccoli and tea. Women in the highest quintile of kaempferol intake relative to those in the lowest had a multivariate relative risk of 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.48, 0.93; p for trend = 0.04). The lower risk associated with kaempferol intake was probably attributable to broccoli consumption.
