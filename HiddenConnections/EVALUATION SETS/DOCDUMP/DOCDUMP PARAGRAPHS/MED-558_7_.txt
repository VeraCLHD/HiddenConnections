The susceptibility of plasma [using 100 mM of 2,2' azobis 2-amidinopropane (AAPH)] as well as that of LDL (using 10 microM of copper ions) to lipid peroxidation was increased by 42% and 34%, respectively, as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay (p < 0.01). Kinetic analysis of LDL oxidation by copper ions revealed a 37% reduction in the lag time required for the initiation of LDL oxidation after 3 weeks of eggs consumption. The total plasma fatty acids concentration increased from 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 3.2 +/- 0.6 mg/ml.
