Mean systolic blood-pressure levels also tended to be higher in the four subjects with coronary-artery fibrous plaques than in those without them: 112 mm Hg as compared with 104 (P = 0.09). These results document the importance of risk-factor levels to early anatomical changes in the aorta and coronary arteries. The progression of fatty streaks to fibrous plaques is uncertain, but these data suggest that a rational approach to the prevention of cardiovascular disease should begin early in life.
