RECENT FINDINGS: So far, several reasons have been identified which are believed to explain tobacco consumption in patients with schizophrenia. Originally, it was widely believed that patients with schizophrenia smoke to increase hepatic clearance and to restore the dopamine blockade of certain antipsychotic drugs to diminish their side effects. However, more recently it became obvious that cigarette smoking may also be reinforcing for patients because it improves psychiatric symptoms, most notably negative and cognitive symptoms.
