Abstract Extensive experimental data have revealed a central role for oxidative stress in atherogenesis and suggested a potential role for 'antioxidant' treatment in cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1-11]. Experimental data, however, have not translated into clinical benefit: most antioxidant vitamin trials have failed to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [12]. Moreover, recent clinical trials have suggested that mono-therapy with certain antioxidant vitamins like vitamin E may, in fact, be detrimental [13].
