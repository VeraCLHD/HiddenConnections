In 2010, 98 raw chicken breasts (n=60 conventional; n=38 organic) were collected from 12 local stores in the Netherlands. Prevalence of ESBL producing micro-organisms was 100% on conventional and 84% on organic samples (p<0.001). Median loads of ESBL producing micro-organisms were 80 (range <20-1360) in conventional, and <20 (range 0-260) CFU/25 g in organic samples (p=0.001).
