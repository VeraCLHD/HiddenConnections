As a hypothesis, it is suggested that this MI pandemic, still raging today, was caused by a change in food processing that occurred after 1920, when the new oil seed industry introduced into our food three greatly harmful lipid substances. The unnatural trans-trans isomer of linoleic acid, which had never been in human food prior to 1920 and which entered our food in margarines and refined oils, blocked the conversion of natural cis-cis linoleic acid to prostaglandin E1, which tends to prevent MI, both by acting as a vasodilator and by minimizing platelet aggregation. Harmful lactones were also introduced into our food, increasing the risk of MI by decreasing the fibrinolytic activity of our blood.
