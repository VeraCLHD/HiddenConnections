Abstract The need for a dietary supply of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic aid (AA) in term infants was evaluated in a double-masked randomized clinical trial of the effects of supplementation of term infant formula with DHA (0.35% of total fatty acids) or with DHA (0.36%) and AA (0.72%) on visual acuity development. One hundred and eight healthy term infants were enrolled in the study; 79 were exclusively formula-fed from birth (randomized group) and 29 were exclusively breast-fed (gold standard group). Infants were evaluated at four time points during the first 12 mo of life for blood fatty acid composition, growth, sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity, and forced choice preferential looking acuity.
