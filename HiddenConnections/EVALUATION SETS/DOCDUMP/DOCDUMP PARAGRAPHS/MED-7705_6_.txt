PCBs were the main organochlorine compounds detected and their concentrations ranged from 0.3 ng g(-1) wet wt in C. hamatus muscle to 15.1 ng g(-1) wet wt in T. bernacchii liver. TEQ concentrations resulted higher in C. hamatus than in T. bernacchii and were due mainly to PCDDs. The presence of PBDEs and organochlorine pollutants in the tissues of Antarctic organisms confirms their global transport and distribution.
