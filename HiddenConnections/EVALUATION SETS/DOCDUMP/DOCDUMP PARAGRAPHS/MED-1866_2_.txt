This study was designed to elucidate other mechanism underlying the butyrate effects on cell growth. METHODS: HT-29 colon carcinoma cells (standard medium or medium lacking serum) were treated with sodium butyrate (NaBu), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or both. Northern blot analyses were performed with cDNA probes specific for c-fos, c-jun, and actin.
