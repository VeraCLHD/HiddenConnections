Results The phytosterol-abundant diet resulted in lower cholesterol absorption [54.2 ± 2.2 % (95% confidence interval, 50.5%, 57.9%) vs. 73.2 ± 1.3% (69.5%, 76.9%), P<0.0001] and 79% higher fecal cholesterol excretion [1322 ± 112 (1083.2, 1483.3) vs. 739 ± 97 mg/day (530.1, 930.2), P<0.0001] relative to the phytosterol-poor diet. Plasma lathosterol/cholesterol ratio rose 82% [from 0.71 ± 0.11 (0.41, 0.96) to 1.29 ± 0.14 μg/mg (0.98, 1.53), (P<0.0001)]. LDL-cholesterol was similar between diets.
