The sum of the 9 urinary estrogen metabolites (183 vs 200 pmol/mg creatinine, p=0.27) and the proportions of individual estrogens and pathways did not differ by meat-eating status. Restricting the models to the samples collected during the luteal phase strengthened the associations. Conclusions Given the limitations of this study, the lower levels of serum estrogens in semi-vegetarians than non-vegetarians need confirmation in larger populations.
