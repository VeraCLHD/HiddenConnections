Abstract BACKGROUND: A reduced rectal perceptual threshold has been reported in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but this phenomenon may be induced by a comorbid psychological state. We evaluated the rectal pain threshold at baseline and after conditioning (repetitive rectal painful distention: RRD) in patients with IBS or functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), which is an abdominal pain disorder, and in healthy controls, and determined whether rectal hypersensitivity is a reliable marker for IBS. METHODS: The rectal sensory threshold was assessed by a barostat.
