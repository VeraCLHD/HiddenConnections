No statistically significant difference occurred in plasma levels of lipid hydroperoxides or those linked to LDL in any of the groups studied. All the groups that used soy and/or green tea presented increased total plasma antioxidant potential. CONCLUSION: Soy and green tea, alone or in combination, increased the total antioxidant potential of hypercholesterolemic patients, whereas only the combination decreased total cholesterol levels.
