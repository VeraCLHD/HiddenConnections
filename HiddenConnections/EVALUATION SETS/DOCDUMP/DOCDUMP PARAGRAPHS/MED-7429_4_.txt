The psychometric measures, which included AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), and clinical dementia rating scale-sums of boxes, were performed to monitor the global cognitive and clinical profiles of the patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive capsule saffron 30 mg/day (15 mg twice per day) (Group A) or capsule placebo (two capsules per day) for a 16-week study. RESULTS: After 16 weeks, saffron produced a significantly better outcome on cognitive function than placebo (ADAS-cog: F=4路12, d.f.=1, P=0路04; CDR: F=4路12, d.f.=1, P=0路04).
