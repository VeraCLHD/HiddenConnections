Abstract A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is known to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the information regarding the antithrombotic activity (antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic) of fruits and vegetables is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the antithrombotic activity of extracts from fruits and vegetables widely consumed in central Chile.
