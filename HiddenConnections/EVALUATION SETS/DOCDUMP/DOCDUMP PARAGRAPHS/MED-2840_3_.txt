No significant differences were observed for IFN-gamma production. Proliferative capability of cells stimulated with PHA was not impaired in aged subjects. Since the amounts of all cytokines studied were similar in unstimulated cultures from young and aged subjects, and also serum levels of TNF-alpha did not differ, these data indicate that the cellular machinery for the production of these cytokines is well preserved in aging, and also that cells from old people are able to up-regulate their production in response to appropriate stimuli.
