Abstract Several foods have been shown to contain natural components (especially polyphenols) which display anti-adhesive properties against Streptococcus mutans, the aetiological agent responsible for dental crown caries, as well as inhibition of glucosyltransferases, which are the S. mutans enzymes involved in the synthesis of an adherent, water-insoluble glucan from sucrose. Other studies have demonstrated an in vitro action on oral plaque biofilm formation and desorption. This study evaluated whether the activity displayed in vitro by food compounds could affect the microbiological composition of saliva and dental plaque of subjects with a diet rich in these foods, comparing the results with those obtained from subjects with a different diet.
