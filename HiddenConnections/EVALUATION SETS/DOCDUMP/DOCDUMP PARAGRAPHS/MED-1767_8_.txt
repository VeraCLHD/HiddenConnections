CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum 25(OH)D was associated with lower mortality of patients with colorectal cancer. These results suggest that colorectal cancer patients with deficient levels of serum 25(OH)D should have their levels restored to a normal range (30-80ng/ml). This could be done with regular testing of serum 25(OH)D to be confident that an adequate serum level is being maintained.
