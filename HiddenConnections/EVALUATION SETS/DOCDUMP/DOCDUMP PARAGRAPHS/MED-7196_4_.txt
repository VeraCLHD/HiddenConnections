Coupling information derived from the available literature with the U.S. Department of Agriculture databases, we estimated content of 6 flavonoid classes and lignans for 50 food group items. We combined these estimates with responses from a modified Block FFQ that was self-completed in 1996-1997 by a population-based sample of women without breast cancer on Long Island, New York (n = 1,500). Total flavonoid and lignan content of food items ranged from 0 to 129 mg/100 g, and the richest sources were tea, cherries, and grapefruit.
