DESIGN: Androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites were profiled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 24-h urine samples of 137 healthy prepubertal children aged 3-12 y, for whom birth characteristics, growth velocity data, and 3-d weighed-diet record information were available. Associations of the sum of C19 metabolites (reflecting daily AA secretion) with nutritional factors [fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), nutrient intakes, glycemic index, and glycemic load] and AA-relevant estimates of steroidogenic enzyme were examined in stepwise multiple regression models adjusted for age, sex, urine volume, and total energy intake. Enzyme activity estimates were calculated by using specific urinary steroid metabolite ratios.
