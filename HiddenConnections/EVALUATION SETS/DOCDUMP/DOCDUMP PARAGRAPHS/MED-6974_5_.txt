CONCLUSIONS: BPO is highly treatable, but should be managed in close collaboration with the patient. Pharmacological agents and minimally invasive procedures, when appropriate, are generally preferred to more invasive surgery. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms usually can be treated by a primary care physician; more complicated cases should be referred to a urologist for evaluation and management.
