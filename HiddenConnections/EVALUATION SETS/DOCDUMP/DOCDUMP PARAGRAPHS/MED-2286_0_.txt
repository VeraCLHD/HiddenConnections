Abstract A method has been developed, based on techniques used for isolating bacteria from the rumen, that enables human faeces to be fractionated into three major components. The method requires repeated, vigorous agitation of a suspension of faecal solids with detergent, the use of a stomacher, and high-speed centrifugation. By this means the faecal microflora are separated from faecal dietary-fibre residues.
