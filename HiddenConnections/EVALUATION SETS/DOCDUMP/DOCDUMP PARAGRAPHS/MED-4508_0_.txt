Abstract During 1 year, samples were taken on 4 days, one sample in each season, from pigs, the floor, and the air inside pig barns and from the ambient air and soil at different distances outside six commercial livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA)-positive pig barns in the north and east of Germany. LA-MRSA was isolated from animals, floor, and air samples in the barn, showing a range of airborne LA-MRSA between 6 and 3,619 CFU/m3 (median, 151 CFU/m3). Downwind of the barns, LA-MRSA was detected in low concentrations (11 to 14 CFU/m3) at distances of 50 and 150 m; all upwind air samples were negative.
