The CO(2) slaughter and not bled birds had significantly higher a* values, indicating more red color, when compared with the ES and bled and decapitated birds. There were no significant differences in the residual hemoglobin contents in the broiler breast muscle when comparing all of the treatments except CO(2) slaughter and not bled, which was significantly (around 15%) greater. Overall TBA-reactive substances (TBARS; raw, cooked at 24 h, and cooked at 72 h PM) indicated that ES and bled birds had the lowest TBARS when compared with the remaining treatments.
