Since it is noninvasive and safe, it can be used to document the process of diffusion temporally over a period of 24 hours. Well-designed studies have shown that diffusion is a very slow process, and that the endplate is the main structure that controls the process of diffusion. Contrast MRI studies have also made it possible to identify endplate breaks in vivo.
