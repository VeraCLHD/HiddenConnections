Abstract Heteroyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) are a class of hazardous chemicals that are receiving heightened attention as a risk factor for human cancer. HAAs arise during the cooking of meats, fish, and poultry, and several HAAs also occur in tobacco smoke condensate and diesel exhaust. Many HAAs are carcinogenic and induce tumors at multiple sites in rodents.
