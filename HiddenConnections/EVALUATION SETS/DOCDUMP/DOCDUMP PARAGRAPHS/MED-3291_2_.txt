Together with observations on other aging and very mild AD cases, these can be related to a model of aging and AD. In this model, tangles develop independently but relatively slowly during aging; these represent neurodegeneration, but by themselves may not represent AD. In contrast, amyloid may be the driving factor in AD, exacerbating neurofibrillary changes and other neurodegeneration.
