Heavier average alcohol use and binge drinking were both positively associated with prevalence and number of sunburns within the past year. The adjusted odds ratios for prevalence and number of sunburns among binge drinkers were 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.31-1.48) and 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.38), respectively. Associations tended to be of similar magnitude for average alcohol use and in all subgroups evaluated.
