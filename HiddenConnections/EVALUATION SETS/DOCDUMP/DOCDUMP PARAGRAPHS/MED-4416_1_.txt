Substantial inhibition on both uptake and transport was observed by extracts from both strawberry and apple. Using sodium-containing (glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 both active) and sodium-free (only GLUT2 active) conditions, we show that the inhibition of GLUT2 was greater than that of SGLT1. The extracts were analyzed and some of the constituent PPTs were also tested.
