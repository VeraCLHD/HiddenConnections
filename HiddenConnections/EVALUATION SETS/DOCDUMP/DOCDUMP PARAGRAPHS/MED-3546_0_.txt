Abstract Rye whole grain and bran intake has shown beneficial effects on prostate cancer progression in animal models, including lower tumor take rates, smaller tumor volumes, and reduced prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations. A human pilot study showed increased apoptosis after consumption of rye bran bread. In this study, we investigated the effect of high intake of rye whole grain and bran on prostate cancer progression as assessed by PSA concentration in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.
