The net difference between the amount of Ca absorbed and excreted in urine did not differ between 2 diet periods (55 vs. 28 Â± 51 mg/d).

In summary, a diet high in protein and PRAL increases the fractional absorption of dietary Ca, which partially compensates for increased urinary Ca, in postmenopausal women.
