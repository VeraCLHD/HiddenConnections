After an initial glomerular injury, likely to be inflammatory, a series of self-perpetuating events occur. Increased glomerular basement permeability leads to loss of lipoprotein lipase activators, which results in hyperlipidemia. Circulating LDL has a charge affinity for glycoaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane and further increases its permeability.
