METHODS: Sixty patients with atopic eczema having latex allergy viewed both the weather information video and the heart-warming movie, Kramer vs. Kramer. Just before and immediately after viewing each video, allergic responses to latex were measured. RESULTS: Viewing the weather information video did not cause emotion with tears in any patients, and it failed to modulate allergic responses.
