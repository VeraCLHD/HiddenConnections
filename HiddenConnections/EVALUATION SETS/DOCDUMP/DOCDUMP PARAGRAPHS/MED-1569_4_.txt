The mean TAA for freeze-dried strawberries based on an 'as consumed' weight (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.58, 30.58) was significantly higher than for fresh (95% CI: 3.18, 3.66), frozen (95% CI: 2.58, 2.79), and jam (95% CI: 1.10, 1.22). The mean TAA based on dry weight for fresh strawberries (95% CI: 40.48, 46.67) was significantly higher than for freeze-dried (95% CI: 29.58, 30.58), frozen (95% CI: 24.62, 26.59), and jam (95% CI: 1.48, 1.64). Results agree with previous studies reporting that strawberries are a valuable source of antioxidants for consumers.
