The middle sacral artery was most often affected, followed by the fourth lumbar arteries. The number of collateral arteries increased with occluded (p <0.001) and narrowed arteries (p = 0.001). Stenotic lumbar/middle sacral arteries were found, on average, five years earlier than atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries.
