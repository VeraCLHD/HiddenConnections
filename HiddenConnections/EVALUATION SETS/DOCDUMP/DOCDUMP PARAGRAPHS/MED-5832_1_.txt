A 6% NaCl (6S) solution with no additives was used as control. Oven-cooked samples (177C degrees oven; 75 degrees C internal temperature) were evaluated by a 9-member trained descriptive analysis sensory panel that rated the intensities of 26 different flavor and texture attributes using 15-point line scales. Data were analyzed using general linear model SAS procedures to determine significant differences (P < or = 0.05) in individual sensory attributes due to marinade treatment.
