The prognosis of postinfectious forms of IBS is more favorable compared with people with idiopathic forms of the disorder. SUMMARY: With full characterization of postdiarrhea forms of FGDs, we should be able to define the mechanisms of disease early in the course of chronic illness and to better understand the more common idiopathic forms of the disease. We are likely to identify specific alteration of gut pathophysiology in postinfectious FGDs and to then classify them not as a poorly characterized group of functional disorders but as specific gastrointestinal disorders.
