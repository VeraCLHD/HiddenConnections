In risk assessment, low dose extrapolation of cancer incidence data from both experimental animals and epidemiology studies has been largely based on models assuming linear correlation at low doses, despite existence of evidence showing otherwise. Another weakness of ED risk assessment is poor exposure data in ecological studies. Those are frequently rough estimates derived from contaminated items of local food basket surveys.
