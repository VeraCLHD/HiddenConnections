Thirty-eight diabetics (DM) with or without KD and five healthy subjects (NL) received a single meal of egg white (56 g protein), cooked with (AGE-diet) or without fructose (100 g) (CL-diet). Serum and urine samples, collected for 48 hr, were monitored for AGE immunoreactivity by ELISA and for AGE-specific crosslinking reactivity, based on complex formation with 125I-labeled fibronectin. The AGE-diet, but not the CL-diet, produced distinct elevations in serum AGE levels in direct proportion to amount ingested (r = 0.8, P < 0.05): the area under the curve for serum (≈10% of ingested AGE) correlated directly with severity of KD; renal excretion of dietary AGE, although normally incomplete (only ≈30% of amount absorbed), in DM it correlated inversely with degree of albuminuria, and directly with creatinine clearance (r = 0.8, P < 0.05), reduced to <5% in DM with renal failure.
