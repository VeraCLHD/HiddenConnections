There were significant correlations between CGRP and IL-6 changes (P = 0.011) and between DLQI and IL-8 changes (P = 0.026) in the curcumin group. In the curcumin group, changes in serum IL-8 concentrations were found as the significant predictor of DLQI scores (P = 0.026) but none of the independent variables could predict pruritus scores. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin supplementation effectively mitigates inflammation in patients suffering from chronic SM-induced cutaneous complications.
