Data were synthesized into pooled odd ratios based on the random effects model, and results were tabulated with the aid of Forest plots. RESULTS: We identified 135 potentially relevant records; only 6 studies met the final criteria. Of the total 508 subjects, 256 and 252 subjects were randomly assigned to receive ginger and placebo, respectively.
