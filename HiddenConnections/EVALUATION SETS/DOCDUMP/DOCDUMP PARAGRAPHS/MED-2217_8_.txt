RESULTS: The mean level of 25(OH)D3 was 31.8 ng/ml, and 47% (n=106) of the patients had insufficient 25(OH)D levels (<30 ng/ml). Baseline characteristics were similar between VD-insufficient and VD-sufficient groups. The incidence of SCF was significantly higher in the VD-insufficient group than in patients with sufficient VD (relative risk=3.5, 95% confidence interval=1.1-10.5, P=0.01).
