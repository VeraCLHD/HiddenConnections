In men, the elevation of GGT induced by heavy drinking (>280 g/week) was found to be significantly reduced by coffee consumption exceeding 4 cups per day. A similar trend was also observed among women, which however, did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Coffee modulates the effect of ethanol on serum GGT activities in a dose- and gender-dependent manner.
