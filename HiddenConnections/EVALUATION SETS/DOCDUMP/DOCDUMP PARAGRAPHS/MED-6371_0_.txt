Abstract The sensitivity of a large number of antibiotic-resistant and nonresistant Helicobacter pylori isolates to the antiadhesion effect of a high-molecular-mass, nondialysable constituent of cranberry juice was tested. Confluent monolayers of gastric cell line in microtiter plate wells were exposed to bacterial suspensions prepared from 83 H. pylori isolates from antibiotic-treated and untreated patients in the presence and absence of the cranberry constituent. Urease assay was used to calculate the percentage of adhesion inhibition.
