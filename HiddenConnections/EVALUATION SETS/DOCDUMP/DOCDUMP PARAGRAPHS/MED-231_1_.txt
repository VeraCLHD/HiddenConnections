Further the aim was to examine factors, including history and concurrent risk of coronary heart disease, associated with a higher and lower treatment belief. METHODS: Eight hundred and twenty-nine (829) Swedish patients using statins completed postal questionnaires about their health, life style, cardiovascular risk factors and expectation of the treatment. Expected treatment benefit was used as outcome measurement.
