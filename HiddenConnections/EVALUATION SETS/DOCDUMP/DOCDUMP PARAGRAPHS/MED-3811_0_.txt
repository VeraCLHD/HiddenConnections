Abstract BACKGROUND: Higher intake of fiber, especially cereal fiber, has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there are limited data on the effect of fiber intake on measures of progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim was to examine the association between intakes of total fiber and fiber from different dietary sources and progression of coronary-artery atherosclerosis among women with established CAD.
