Alterations in this superorganism will be manifest in the metabolite complement within its serum and urine samples. The unraveling of this metabolic compartmentalization in this complex ecosystem will certainly be a challenge for systems biology and necessary for defining human health at the molecular level. Within the systems biology framework, functional analyses at the level of gene expression (transcriptomics), protein translation (proteomics), and, more recently, the metabolite network (metabolomics) have become increasingly popular.
