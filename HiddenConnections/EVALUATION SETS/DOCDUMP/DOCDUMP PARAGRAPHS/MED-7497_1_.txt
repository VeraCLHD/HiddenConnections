Previous intervention studies on fish PUFA and inflammatory markers in healthy individuals did not analyze a broad spectrum of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules, or their interrelationships.

METHODS: Individuals (n=77) aged 50-70 years completed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study.
