In sons of "high beef consumers" (>7 beef meals/week), sperm concentration was 24.3% lower (P = 0.014) and the proportion of men with sperm concentration below 20 x 10(6)/ml was three times higher (17.7 versus 5.7%, P = 0.002) than in men whose mothers ate less beef. A history of previous subfertility was also more frequent among sons of "high beef consumers" (P = 0.015). Sperm concentration was not significantly related to mother's consumption of other meat or to the man's consumption of any meat.
