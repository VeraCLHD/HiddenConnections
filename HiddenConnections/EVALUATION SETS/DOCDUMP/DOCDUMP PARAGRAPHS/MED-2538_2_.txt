We investigated whether DBP exposure impairs steroidogenesis by the human fetal testis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine effects of DBP exposure on testosterone production by normally growing human fetal testis xenografts. DESIGN: Human fetal testes (14-20 wk gestation; n=12) were xenografted into castrate male nude mice that were treated for 4-21 d with vehicle, or 500 mg/kgÂ·d DBP, or monobutyl phthalate (active metabolite of DBP); all mice were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin to mimic normal human pregnancy.
