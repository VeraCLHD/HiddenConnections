Change in telomere length was inversely correlated with baseline telomere length (r=âˆ’0.47, p<0.0001). No significant difference in leukocyte telomere length was detected in any intervention group compared to controls, nor was the magnitude of weight loss associated with telomere length at 12 months. Conclusions Twelve-months of dietary weight loss and exercise did not change telomere length in postmenopausal women.
