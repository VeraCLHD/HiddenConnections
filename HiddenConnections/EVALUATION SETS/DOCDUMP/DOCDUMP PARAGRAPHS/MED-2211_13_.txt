For individual patient data, between-group differences in BP at the final follow up, adjusted for baseline BP, were calculated before combining in a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in SBP and DBP measured in an office setting. RESULTS: We included 46 trials (4541 participants) in the trial-level meta-analysis.
