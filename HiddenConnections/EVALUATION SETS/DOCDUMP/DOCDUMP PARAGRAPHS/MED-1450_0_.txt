Abstract Although assays for the most popular markers of exercise-induced oxidative stress may experience methodological flaws, there is sufficient credible evidence to suggest that exercise is accompanied by an increased generation of free radicals, resulting in a measurable degree of oxidative modifications to various molecules. However, the mechanisms responsible are unclear. A common assumption that increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption leads per se to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is not supported by in vitro and in vivo data.
