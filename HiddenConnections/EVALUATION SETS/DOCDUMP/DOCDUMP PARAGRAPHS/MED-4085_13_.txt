In final regression models, higher gonadotropin levels were associated with lower spinal BMD in women (p = 0.017); serum calcium was a significant predictor of hip (p = 0.014) and spine (p = 0.013) BMD in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Bone density in adults with galactosemia is low, indicating the potential for increased fracture risk, the etiology of which appears to be multifactorial.
