Blood samples were drawn from 14 normal subjects prior to, at 1, 2 and 3 h following ingestion of 75 g glucose. ROS generation by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) and mononuclear cells (MNC) increased to a peak of 244 +/- 42% and 233 +/- 34% of the basal respectively at 2h. The levels of p47phox in MNC homogenates increased significantly at 2 h and 3 h after glucose intake.
