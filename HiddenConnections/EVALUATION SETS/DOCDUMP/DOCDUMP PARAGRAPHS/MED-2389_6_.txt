In the clinical setting, there are no standard laboratory diagnostics for NO status and no prescription therapies to safely and effectively restore NO homeostasis, despite being recognized as the earliest indicator for a number of different chronic diseases. This review will reveal how many modern therapies and western lifestyles actually lead to a decrease in NO homeostasis in patients, from pediatrics to geriatrics. The findings outlined here highlight why nitric oxide homeostasis should be accounted for and considered in the treatment of patients and in the development of new therapies.
