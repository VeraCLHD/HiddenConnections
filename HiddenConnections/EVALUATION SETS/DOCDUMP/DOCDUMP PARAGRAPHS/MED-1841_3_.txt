Progestins generally attenuate the effects of estrogen on the concentrations of HDLC.

Recent studies suggest that estrogen may protect against coronary heart disease in other ways besides favorably altering serum concentrations of lipoproteins and that progestins might not have adverse effects on the risk of heart disease.
