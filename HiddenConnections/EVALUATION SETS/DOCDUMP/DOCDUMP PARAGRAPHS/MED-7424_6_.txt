The iodine status of pregnant women was borderline sufficient (median UIC = 153 microg/L; 95% CI = 105-196), while lactating (115 microg/L; 95% CI = 62-162) and nonpregnant, nonlactating (130 microg/L; 95% CI = 117-140) women were iodine sufficient. Dairy product consumption was an important contributor to iodine status among both pregnant and nonpregnant, nonlactating women, and those who do not consume dairy products may be at risk for iodine deficiency. Although larger samples are needed to confirm these findings, these results raise concerns about the iodine status of pregnant women and women of reproductive age who are not consuming dairy products.
