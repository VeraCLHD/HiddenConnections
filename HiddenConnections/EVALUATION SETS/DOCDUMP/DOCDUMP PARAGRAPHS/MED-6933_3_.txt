Oxidative stress, inflammation, and the evasion of apoptosis are important biological mechanisms by which carcinogenesis occurs. Subsequently, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic activity represent important activities for preventing, suppressing, or reversing the development of carcinogenesis. Ultimately, these mechanisms of action may provide a useful basis for screening novel phytochemicals for chemopreventive activity.
