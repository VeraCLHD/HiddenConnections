The best detection limits were obtained with B394; therefore, this biosensor was used to produce calibration data in milk with three OPs in the concentration range of 5 × 10(-6)M to 5 × 10(-12)M. The limit of detection (LOD) obtained in milk for CPO, EPOx and MOx were 5 × 10(-12)M, 5 × 10(-9)M and 5 × 10(-10)M, respectively, with a correlation coefficient R(2)=0.9910. The automated flow-based biosensor successfully quantified the OPs in different fat-containing milk samples.
