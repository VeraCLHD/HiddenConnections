Major determinants of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene excretion were smoking, dietary PAH intake, and age. The mean 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in the urine of the volunteers in this study ranged between 0.05 and 0.79 mumol/mol creatinine. Smokers excreted on average 0.25 mumol/mol creatinine (range: 0.10-0.79 mumol/mol creatinine), and nonsmokers on average 0.12 mumol/mol creatinine (range: 0.04-0.29 mumol/mol creatinine).
