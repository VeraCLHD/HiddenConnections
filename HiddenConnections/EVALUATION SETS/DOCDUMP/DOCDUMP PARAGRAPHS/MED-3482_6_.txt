Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was performed in fasting conditions and 3h after the intake of the oil rich meal. Furthermore, blood samples were taken at these stages for the lipid profiles and plasma glucose determinations. All the meals resulted in a similar acute endothelial impairment (FMD decrease of 32.1%, confidence interval [CI] 95%, 28.0-36.2) and postprandial increase in triglycerides (27.03%, CI 95%, 20.5-33.3), independently of the type of oil ingested (p=0.44) and regardless of its deep-fry level (p=0.62).
