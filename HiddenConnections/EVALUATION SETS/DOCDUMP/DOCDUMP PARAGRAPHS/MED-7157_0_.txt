Abstract OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between vegetable and fruit consumption and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a case-control study was conducted in central Japan in 2006. METHODS: A total of 278 referred patients with COPD diagnosed within the past four years and 340 community-based controls undertook spirometric measurements of respiratory function. A structured questionnaire was administered face-to-face to obtain information on demographics, lifestyle and habitual food consumption.
