Abstract A 24-year-old female patient presented to her community hospital with mild elevations of serum transaminase and bilirubin levels. Because of multiple sclerosis, she was treated with interferon beta-1a for 6 weeks. After exclusion of viral hepatitis due to hepatitis A-E, interferon beta-1a was withdrawn under the suspicion of drug-induced hepatitis.
