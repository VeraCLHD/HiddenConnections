All analyses were cross-sectional and no study included in the review received a positive quality rating (twelve negative, six neutral). Eight studies observed a statistically significant positive association between urinary or serum BPA levels and BMI, and ten studies observed no association. Studies where BMI was a primary outcome and studies of neutral quality were more likely to observe an association.
