In 2008, 47.8 million prescriptions were written for HCTZ alone and 87.1 million prescriptions for HCTZ combinations. However, there is no evidence that HCTZ in its usual dose of 12.5-25 mg daily reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. In a meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials with over 1400 patients, the 24-hour decrease in blood pressure with HCTZ was inferior to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers (P <.001 for all).
