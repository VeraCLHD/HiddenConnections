In multivariate analysis with adjustment of lifestyle and dietary factors, in comparison with women in the lowest quartile of BPA concentration, those in the highest quartile had 0.23 kg per year (95% CI, 0.07â€“0.38 kg per year) greater weight gain during the 10-year follow-up (P-trend = 0.02). Several phthalate metabolites, including phthalic acid, MBzP and monobutyl phthalate, were also associated with faster prospective weight gain in a dose-response fashion (P-trend < 0.01), whereas other phthalates metabolites, including MEP and monoethylhexyl phthalate, were not monotonically associated with body weight change. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest urinary concentrations of BPA and certain individual phthalate metabolites that were associated with modestly greater weight gain in a dose-response fashion.
