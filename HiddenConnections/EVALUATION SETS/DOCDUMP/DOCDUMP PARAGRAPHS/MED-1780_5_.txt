In diabetes with macroalbuminuria, GFR decreased after ingestion of tuna fish meal and did not significantly change after intake of bean curd. In both normal subjects and diabetic patients, urinary AER did not increase after each kind of protein loading. Plasma concentrations of alanine, glycine, and arginine, known to induce glomerular hyperfiltration, increased to a greater degree after ingestion of tuna fish meal than after administration of bean curd.
