Abstract A human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was used to develop an in vitro screening assay for the detection of xenoestrogenic environmental pollutants. MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). An estrogenic response was defined as an increase in the frequency of proliferating MCF-7 cells, and was measured using a thymidine analog, bromodeoxyuridine, and flow cytometry.
