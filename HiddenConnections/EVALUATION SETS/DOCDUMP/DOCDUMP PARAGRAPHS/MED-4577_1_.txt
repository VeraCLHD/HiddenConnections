Using ion-exchange chromatography the diphenols are separated into two fractions 1) the biologically "active" fraction containing the free compounds + mono- and disulfates and 2) the biologically "inactive" fraction containing the mono- and diglucuronides and the sulfoglucuronides. After hydrolysis the fractions are further purified by solid phase extraction and ion exchange chromatography. Losses during the complete procedure are corrected for using radioactive estrogen conjugates during the first steps and later by adding deuterated internal standards of all compounds measured (matairesinol, enterodiol, enterolactone, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin, equol, and genistein).
