MEGF markedly reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and induced the G2/M arrest of the cell cycle in a concentration dependent manner. These effects were associated with the down-regulation of cyclin A, up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21 (WAF1/CIP1) and dephosphorylation of Cdc25C. Furthermore, it was found that MEGF decreased the levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression without significant changes in the levels of COX-1, which was correlated with a decrease in prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis.
