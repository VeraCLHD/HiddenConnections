The low gross mortality (4% per year) and the progression rate (from -8 to 0 mL/min/year at 6 months) are reassuring concerning safety. None of the baseline conditions, including age, educational level, comorbidity or kidney function, discriminated the patients who followed the diet for at least 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a wider offer of LPD-KA to patients with severe and progressive CKD.
