It is possible that in sophisticated populations, the higher concentrations of fecal bile acids and sterols, and longer transit time, favor the production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites. Of secular changes in diet, evidence suggests that the following may have etiological importance: 1) the fall in intake of fiber-containing foods with its effects on bowel physiology, and 2) the decreased fiber but increased fat intakes, in their respective capacities to raise concentrations of fecal bile acids, sterols, and other noxious substances. For possible prophylaxis against colon cancer, recommendations for a lower fat intake, or a higher intake of fiber-containing foods (apart from fiber ingestion from bran) are extremely unlikely to be adopted.
