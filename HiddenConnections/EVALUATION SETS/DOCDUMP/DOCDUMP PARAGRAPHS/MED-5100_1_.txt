It interacts specifically with the carbohydrate epitope Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R (termed the alpha-galactosyl epitope). This epitope is expressed in large amounts on thyrocytes of nonprimate mammals, but not of humans. We have previously found that binding of anti-Gal to alpha-galactosyl epitopes on porcine thyrocytes results in stimulatory effects similar to those exerted by thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin).
