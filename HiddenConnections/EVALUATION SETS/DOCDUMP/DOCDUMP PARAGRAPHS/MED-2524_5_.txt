Cell proliferation was significantly increased at 10(-8)-10(-5) mol/l of BBP and DBP, and at 10(-8)-10(-6) mol/l of DEHP treatment. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was substantially increased in cultures with DEHP (10(-8)-10(-6) mol/l), BBP (10(-8)-10(-5) mol/l), and DBP (10(-7)-10(-5) mol/l). Obvious increases in PI3K, p-AKT, and PCNA were noted in cultures with 17Î²-estradiol, BBP, DBP, and DEHP.
