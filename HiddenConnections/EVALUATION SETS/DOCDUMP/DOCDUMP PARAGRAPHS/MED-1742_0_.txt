Abstract Seventy-six male volunteers, who were not occupationally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), participated in a study on the effect of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary PAH intake, age, and body fat content on the baseline excretion of 1-hydroxypyrene in urine. Major determinants of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene excretion were smoking, dietary PAH intake, and age. The mean 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in the urine of the volunteers in this study ranged between 0.05 and 0.79 mumol/mol creatinine.
