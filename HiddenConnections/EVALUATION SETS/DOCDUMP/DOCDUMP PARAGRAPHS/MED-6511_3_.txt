Subjects completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (subjects completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (subscales for restraint, hunger, and disinhibition) and kept three 3-d food records. Vegetarians had lower BMIs (21.1 +/- 2.3 vs 22.7 +/- 1.9, P < 0.05), percentage body fat (24.0 +/- 5.5% vs 27.4 +/- 5.1%, P < 0.05), and restraint scores (6.4 +/- 4.4 vs 9.5 +/- 3.7, P < 0.05). Mean cycle lengths were similar, but vegetarians had longer luteal phase lengths (11.2 +/- 2.6 vs 9.1 +/- 3.8 d, P < 0.05).
