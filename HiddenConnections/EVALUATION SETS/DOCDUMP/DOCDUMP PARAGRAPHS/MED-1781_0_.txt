Abstract The renal response to 100 g/1.73 m2 protein load in the form of a meat meal was studied in 19 normal subjects and 35 normoalbuminuric insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDs) under conditions of sustained euglycemia. The area under the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) curve rose above base line by 1,904 +/- 292 in normals and 502 +/- 237 ml/1.73 m2 in IDDs (P less than 0.01). The meat meal induced a greater increment in the area under the glucagon curve in normals (14,930 +/- 186 pg.ml-1.
