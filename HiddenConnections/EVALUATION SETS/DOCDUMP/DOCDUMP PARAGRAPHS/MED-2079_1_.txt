Numerous risk factors have been linked to this disease. The safety of using growth promoters, such as zeranol, remains under debate due to the lack of sufficient in vitro and in vivo evidence. Using CellTiter 96â„¢ Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation assay, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we evaluated the effects of sera harvested from experimental and control heifers before and after one month of zeranol implantation on the growth of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 as well as the involved mechanisms.
