Abstract OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of postprandial lipid changes on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after a high-fat meal. METHODS: We studied 50 CAD patients and 25 control participants, who were all normocholesterolemic. Flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery was evaluated by the high-resolution ultrasound technique before and after a single high-fat meal (800 calories; 50 g fat).
