In multivariate analyses, those that believe their personal physician receives gifts were more likely to report low physician trust (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.56–3.30) and high health care system distrust (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.49–2.77). Similarly, those that believe almost all doctors accept gifts were more likely to report low physician trust (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.25–2.29) and high health care system distrust (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.82–3.62). CONCLUSIONS Patients perceive physician–industry gift relationships as common.
