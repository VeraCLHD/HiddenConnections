Our primary objective was to investigate the dose-response of nitrate intake on nitric oxide status and nitrate reduction in the mouth. We also assessed whether antibacterial toothpaste can inhibit nitrate reduction and blunt subsequent increases in circulating nitric oxide. A randomised, controlled, crossover trial with healthy women (n = 16) was conducted.
