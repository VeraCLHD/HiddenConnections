Abstract AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Sedentary (sitting) behaviours are ubiquitous in modern society. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association of sedentary time with diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. METHODS: Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for terms related to sedentary time and health outcomes.
