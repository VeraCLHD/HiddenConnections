Smokers excreted on average 0.25 mumol/mol creatinine (range: 0.10-0.79 mumol/mol creatinine), and nonsmokers on average 0.12 mumol/mol creatinine (range: 0.04-0.29 mumol/mol creatinine). The average number of cigarettes smoked per day correlated well with urinary 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations (rs = 0.67, P < 0.001). The consumption of PAH-containing food products and active smoking account for 99% of total pyrene intake.
