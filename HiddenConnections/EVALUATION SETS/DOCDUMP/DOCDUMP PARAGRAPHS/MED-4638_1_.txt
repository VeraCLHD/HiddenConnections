In the present study we analyzed the effect of eggs consumption for 3 weeks on lipoprotein atherogenicity. Consumption of 2 eggs per day with the meals, for 3 weeks resulted in a minor elevation in plasma glucose and urea concentrations. Plasma cholesterol concentration increased by 11% (p < 0.05) as a result of increased plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.
