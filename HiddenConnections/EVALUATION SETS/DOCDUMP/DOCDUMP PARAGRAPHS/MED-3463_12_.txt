CONCLUSION: Available evidences showed that caffeine had different effects on IOP in different groups of individuals. For normal individuals, IOP was not changed by ingestion of caffeine, while for patients with glaucoma or OHT, IOP increased significantly. More high-quality RCTs are warranted to confirm this.
