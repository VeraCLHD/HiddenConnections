Strikingly, age was no longer associated with the proportions of senescent or naïve T-cells after adjusting for VO(2max), while the association between VO(2max) and these T-cell subsets withstood adjustment for age, BMI and percentage body fat. Ranking participants by age-adjusted VO(2max) revealed that the highest tertile had 17% more naïve CD8+ T-cells and 57% and 37% less senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, respectively, compared to the lowest tertile. VO(2max) was not associated with latent cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection, indicating that the moderating associations of VO(2max) were not confounded by persistent viral infections.
