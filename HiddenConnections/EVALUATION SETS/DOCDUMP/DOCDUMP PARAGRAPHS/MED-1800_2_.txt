In the decade after the discovery of BLV in 1969, studies using agar gel immunodiffusion and complement fixation assays failed to find antibodies to BLV in human sera. This led to the prevailing opinion that exposure of humans to BLV and/or the potential for infection are not significant and therefore the virus is not a public health hazard. We reexamined this issue using more sensitive immunological techniques available today.
