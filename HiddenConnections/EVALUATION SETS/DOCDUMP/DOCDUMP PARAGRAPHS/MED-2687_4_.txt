For possible prophylaxis against colon cancer, recommendations for a lower fat intake, or a higher intake of fiber-containing foods (apart from fiber ingestion from bran) are extremely unlikely to be adopted. For future research, western populations with considerably lower than average mortality rates, e.g., Seventh Day Adventists, Mormons, the rural Finnish population, as well as developing populations, demand intensive study. Also requiring elucidation are the respective roles of diet and of genetic constitution on concentrations of fecal bile acids, etc., and on transit time, in prone and nonprone populations.
