RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) protein requirement was not different between the younger and older subjects: 0.61 +/- 0.14 compared with 0.58 +/- 0.12 g protein x kg body wt(-1) . d(-1). On the basis of individual requirement estimates from the younger and older subjects combined (2.5% trimming from each tail and variation estimated by the bootstrap), an adequate protein allowance for these subjects was calculated to be 0.85 +/- 0.21 g protein x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1).
