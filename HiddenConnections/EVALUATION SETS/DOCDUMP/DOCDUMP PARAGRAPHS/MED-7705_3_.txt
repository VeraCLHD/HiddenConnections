The 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs) were also calculated to evaluate the potential risk of these compounds for the two species. In general, POP levels were higher in the tissues of T. bernacchii than in C. hamatus and the highest concentrations were found in the liver of both species. The PBDE levels varied from 160.5 pg g(-1) wet wt in C. hamatus muscle to 789.9 pg g(-1) wet wt in T. bernacchii liver and were lower than the levels of PCBs.
