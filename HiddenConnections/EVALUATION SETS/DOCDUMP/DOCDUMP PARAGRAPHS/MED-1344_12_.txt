An inverse association between PRALdiet and proximal femur BMD was detected among men <800 mg/d dietary calcium (p=0.02); and no associations â‰¥800 mg/d (p=0.98). A significant interaction with PRALtotal was not observed. In conclusion, when supplemental calcium is considered, there is no association between DAL and BMD among adults.
