RESULTS Ten patients completed the study and had the following characteristics: age, 53.2 years (95% CI, 48.0–58.4); BMI, 51.2 kg/m2 (46.1–56.4); diabetes duration, 7.4 years (4.8–10.0); and HbA1c, 8.52% (7.08–9.96). Patients lost 7.3 kg (8.1–6.5) during the presurgery period versus 4.0 kg (6.2–1.7) during the postsurgery period (P = 0.01 between periods). Daily glycemia in the presurgery period was significantly lower (1,293.58 mg/dL·day [1,096.83–1,490.33) vs. 1,478.80 mg/dL·day [1,277.47–1,680.13]) compared with the postsurgery period (P = 0.02 between periods).
