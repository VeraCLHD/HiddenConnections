Raw vegetable intake was significantly inversely associated with ischemic stroke (>27 vs ≤27 g/day; HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.34-0.73), and raw fruit borderline significantly with hemorrhagic stroke (>120 vs ≤120 g/day; HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.28-1.01). CONCLUSIONS: High intake of raw fruit and vegetables may protect against stroke. No association was found between processed fruit and vegetable consumption and incident stroke.
