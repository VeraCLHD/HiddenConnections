Next, I discuss a number of important studies that have addressed the question whether it is the lack of calories and/or specific nutrients that determines the longevity response to dietary restriction. Finally, I review the evidence for hormesis as a proximate mechanism underpinning the impact of dietary restriction on lifespan. In aggregate, the currently available demographic data suggest that dietary restriction can both slow the age-related progressive accumulation of cellular damage and also enhance the ability of organisms to cope with irreversible injury.
