RESULTS: A total of 213 and 85 deaths from suicide were recorded during 403,019 and 473,351 person-years of follow-up for men and women, respectively. Higher intakes of fish, EPA, or DHA were not associated with a lower risk of suicide. Multivariate HRs (95% CI) of suicide death for the highest versus lowest quintile of fish consumption were 0.95 (0.60-1.49) and 1.20 (0.58-2.47) for men and women, respectively.
