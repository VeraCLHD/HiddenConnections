Increased colonic pressure activity after food discussion correlated significantly (r=0.45, p<0.02) with gastric acid output. There was no correlation (r=-0.1, p>0.5) between colonic pressure activity and gastric acid output in the control study. These data show that there is a cephalic phase of the colonic response to food.
