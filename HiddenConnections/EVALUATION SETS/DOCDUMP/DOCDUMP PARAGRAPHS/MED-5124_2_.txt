To provide perspective on the magnitude of the effect, we also analysed the effect of smoking (pack-years). METHODS: Consecutive patients attending vascular prevention clinics at University Hospital had baseline measurement of TPA by duplex ultrasound, and filled out questionnaires regarding their lifestyle and medications, including pack-years of smoking, and the number of egg yolks consumed per week times the number of years consumed (egg-yolk years). RESULTS: Data were available in 1262 patients; mean (SD) age was 61.5 (14.8) years; 47% were women.
