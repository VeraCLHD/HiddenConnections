Using sodium-containing (glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 both active) and sodium-free (only GLUT2 active) conditions, we show that the inhibition of GLUT2 was greater than that of SGLT1. The extracts were analyzed and some of the constituent PPTs were also tested. Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (IC₅₀ =31 μM), phloridzin (IC₅₀=146 μM), and 5-caffeoylquinic acid (IC₅₀=2570 μM) contributed 26, 52 and 12%, respectively, to the inhibitory activity of the apple extract, whereas pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (IC₅₀=802 μM) contributed 26% to the total inhibition by the strawberry extract.
