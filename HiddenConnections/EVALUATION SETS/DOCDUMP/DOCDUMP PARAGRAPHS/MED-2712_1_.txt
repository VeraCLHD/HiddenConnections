Studies indicate that peripheral markers of oxidative stress in AD patients could be informative about the pathophysiology of this brain condition. Here, we present a pilot study examining the efficacy of the copper-chelating agent d-penicillamine in reducing oxidative stress in AD patients. DESIGN: Serum levels of copper sampled in AD patients and healthy controls indicate a copper homeostasis imbalance in AD.
