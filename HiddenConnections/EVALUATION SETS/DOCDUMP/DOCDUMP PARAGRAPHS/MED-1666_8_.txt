Ulcer incidence in 113 patients followed for 3 months was 7% (95% CI 2.4-11.8%). Helicobacter pylori infection increased the risk of a duodenal ulcer [odds ratio (OR) 18.5, 95% CI 2.3-149.4], as did age >70 for ulcers in stomach and duodenum combined (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.7). CONCLUSIONS: Gastroduodenal ulcers are found in one in 10 patients taking low-dose aspirin, and most are asymptomatic; this needs considering when discussing risks/benefits with patients.
