Weight gains, protein content of jejunum, and morphometric indices of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were greater in challenged poults fed 0.3 g/100 g putrescine than in controls. We conclude that dietary putrescine supplementation may be beneficial to poult growth, mucosal development of the small intestine, and to recovery from subclinical coccidiosis.
