Four of the groups received a chlorophyll based marker at a rate of 2g/d: i) Mg-Chlorophyllin (MgC), ii) Fe-Chlorophyllin (FeC), iii) Zn-Chlorophyllin (ZnC) or iv) Spirulina (Chlorophyll a extract from blue green algae, Sp). The last group received no supplement as the control (Con). The appearance of chlorophyllin markers and their derivatives in faeces was similar with mean concentrations of 3.1 and 7.2 Î¼g/g DM, respectively.
