Abstract The effect of the food matrix and dietary fibre on the bioavailability of folate is not known. In a controlled, 3-week dietary intervention study, 28 men and 42 women were divided into six groups to receive either a control diet (n = 10), or the control diet plus 20 g/MJ per day (n = 12 per group) of whole-leaf spinach, minced spinach, liquefied spinach, or liquefied spinach to which dietary fibre (10 g/kg wet weight) was added. The sixth group received the control diet plus a synthetic carotenoid supplement with similar amounts of beta-carotene and lutein as found in spinach.
