The statistical analysis demonstrated that an increase in the distance to the nearest poultry farm by 1 km was associated with a six-fold decreased risk of an outbreak of colibacillosis (odds ratio=0.16). Furthermore, a 1 l increase in cage volume per hen was associated with a 33% decrease in the risk of an outbreak (odds ratio=0.75). It was concluded that the distance between poultry farms and the hen density in the cages are important risk factors for outbreaks of colibacillosis in flocks of layer hens.
