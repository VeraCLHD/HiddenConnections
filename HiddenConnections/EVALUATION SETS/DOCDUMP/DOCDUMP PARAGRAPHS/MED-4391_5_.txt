Caffeinated coffee led to a decline of FMD (7.78, 2.86, 2.12, 4.44 and 4.57% at baseline, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min respectively; P < 0.001). This adverse effect was focused at 30 (P = 0.004) and 60 min (P < 0.001). No significant effect on FMD was found with the decaffeinated coffee session (7.07, 6.24, 5.21, 7.41 and 5.20%; P = NS).
