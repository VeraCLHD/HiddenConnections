Plasma glucose iAUC also differed between interventions (overall P < 0.001). Regular activity breaks lowered values by 18.9 mmol · L(-1) · 9 h(-1) (95% CI: 10.0, 28.0 mmol · L(-1) · 9 h(-1); P < 0.001) when compared with prolonged sitting and by 17.4 mmol · L(-1) · 9 h(-1) (95% CI: 8.4, 26.3 mmol · L(-1) · 9 h(-1); P < 0.001) when compared with physical activity. Plasma triglyceride iAUC differed between interventions (overall P = 0.023).
