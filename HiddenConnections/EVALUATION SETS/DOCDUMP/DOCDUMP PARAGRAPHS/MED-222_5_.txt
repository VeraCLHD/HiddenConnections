Relative risks for incident diabetes (fourth vs. first quartile of FFAs) were increased in a basic model adjusted for age, sex, race, and center (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.20-2.34) and in a model further adjusted for baseline fasting glucose, insulin, BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, and the inflammation score (1.63, 1.04-2.57). Relative risks associated with a greater FFA level were lowest among those of normal weight and highest among the obese, but a formal test of interaction between FFAs and BMI was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with higher fasting levels of plasma FFAs were at modestly higher risk of type 2 diabetes in this cohort of middle-aged adults.
