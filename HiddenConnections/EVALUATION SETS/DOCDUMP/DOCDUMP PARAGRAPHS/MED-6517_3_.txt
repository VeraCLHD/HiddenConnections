We followed 47,302 men and identified a total of 987 incident colorectal cancer cases from 1986 to 2004. We assessed dietary and supplemental choline and betaine intake every four years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate multivariate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
