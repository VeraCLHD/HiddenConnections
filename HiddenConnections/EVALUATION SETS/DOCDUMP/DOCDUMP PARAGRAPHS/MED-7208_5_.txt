RESULTS: In the present study, sulforaphane was found to induce dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile. Additionally, a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine was found to increase the growth inhibition in a synergistic manner in HeLa cells compared to the individual drugs. Also, the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1Î² upon treatment with sulforaphane.
