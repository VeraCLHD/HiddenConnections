In aggregate, the currently available demographic data suggest that dietary restriction can both slow the age-related progressive accumulation of cellular damage and also enhance the ability of organisms to cope with irreversible injury. Restriction of essential nutrients as well as calories may affect life expectancy, perhaps in a species specific fashion. Hormesis, i.e. an evolutionary conserved stress response routine providing protection against a wide variety of (other) hazards in response to low levels of stress, is very likely to contribute to the beneficial health effects of dietary restriction.
