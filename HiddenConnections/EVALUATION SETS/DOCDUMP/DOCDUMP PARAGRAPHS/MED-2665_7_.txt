Dyslipidemia in renal disease is usually characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides. After an initial glomerular injury, likely to be inflammatory, a series of self-perpetuating events occur. Increased glomerular basement permeability leads to loss of lipoprotein lipase activators, which results in hyperlipidemia.
