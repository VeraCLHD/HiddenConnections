Results Based on double-blind RCTs, 8 for falls (n=2426) and 12 for non-vertebral fractures (n=42,279), there was a significant dose-response relationship between higher dose and higher achieved 25(OH)D and greater fall and fracture prevention. Optimal benefits were observed at the highest dose tested to date for, 700 to 1000 IU vitamin D/d, or mean 25(OH)D between 75 to 110 nmol/l (30â€“44 ng/ml). Prospective cohort data on cardiovascular health and colo-rectal cancer prevention suggested increased benefits with the highest categories of 25(OH)D evaluated (median levels between 75 and 110 nmol/l).
