Three control samples of healthy, young, cadavers were analysed and showed the absence of debris within the normal, healthy colon mucosa. The study reveals the presence of particulate debris, generally considered as biocompatible, in pathological specimens of human colon. The findings suggest a possible link between the presence of such particles and the underlying pathology in the cases analysed.
