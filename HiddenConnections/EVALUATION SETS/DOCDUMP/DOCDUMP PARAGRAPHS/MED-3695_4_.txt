The acid exposure time in subjects in the upright position was significantly longer in the 800-ml group than in the 500-ml group for the entire PP (2.7 +/- 1.5%; mean +/- SE, 0.7 +/- 0.4%; P < 0.05). Of subjects in the supine position, the high-fat group showed significantly longer acid exposure time than the low-fat group both for the entire PP (7.6 +/- 3.0%, 0.7 +/- 0.5%; p < 0.05) and for the second hour (P < 0.05). We have demonstrated that differences in the meal volume and fat content influence gastroesophageal reflux in healthy asymptomatic subjects and that this influence varies with the position.
