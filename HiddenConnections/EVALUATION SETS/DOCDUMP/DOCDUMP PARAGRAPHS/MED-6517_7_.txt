We did not find any statistically significant associations between choline intake or betaine intake and risk of colorectal cancer. Comparing the top quintile with bottom quintile, multivariate RRs (95% CI) were 0.97 (0.79-1.20; Ptrend = 0.87) for choline intake and 0.94 (0.77-1.16; Ptrend = 0.79) for betaine intake. Similarly, we observed no associations between colorectal cancer risk and choline from free choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, or sphingomyelin.
