The aim was to compare the effects of 9 g salt/day with 6 g salt/day intake on measures of vascular function and explore mechanisms of effect in overweight and obese adults. METHODS: Twenty-five overweight/obese subjects (BMI 27-40 kg/m(2)) completed a randomised cross-over study of 6 weeks each on a reduced salt (RS) (6 g/day) and usual salt diet (US) (9 g/day). Flow-mediated-dilatation (FMD), 24 h blood pressure (BP), augmentation index (AIx), pulse wave velocity (PWV), plasma and urinary nitrate/nitrite, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 and vascular adhesion molecules were measured after 2 days and 6 weeks.
