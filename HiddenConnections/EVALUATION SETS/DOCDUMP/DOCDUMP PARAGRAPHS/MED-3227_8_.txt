Results Cerebral Aβ was quantified using a global PIB index, which averages PIB retention in cortical areas prone to amyloidosis. Statistical models that controlled for age and the apoE ε4 allele showed independent associations between LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and PIB index. Higher LDL and lower HDL were both associated with higher PIB index.
