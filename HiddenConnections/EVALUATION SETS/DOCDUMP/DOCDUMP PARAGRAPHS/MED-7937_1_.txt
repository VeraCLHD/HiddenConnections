The authors prospectively evaluated intakes of flavonols and flavones in relation to risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD in the Nurses' Health Study. They assessed dietary information from the study's 1990, 1994, and 1998 food frequency questionnaires and computed cumulative average intakes of flavonols and flavones. Cox proportional hazards regression with time-varying variables was used for analysis.
