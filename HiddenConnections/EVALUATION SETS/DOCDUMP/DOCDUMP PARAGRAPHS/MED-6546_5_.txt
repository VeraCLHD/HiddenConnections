Cinnamon ingestion also reduced insulin responses to OGTT on day 14 (-27.1 +/- 6.2% vs. day 0; P < 0.05), as well as improving insulin sensitivity on day 14 (vs. day 0; P < 0.05). These effects were lost following cessation of cinnamon feeding. Cinnamon may improve glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity, but the effects are quickly reversed.
