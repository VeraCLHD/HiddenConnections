Abstract Although uncommon in North America, Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been identified in some industrialized countries in patients without a history of travel to HEV-endemic countries. Its presence is ubiquitous worldwide in swine populations. Zoonotic transmission of swine HEV to non human primates has been achieved experimentally and transmission of HEV after ingestion of contaminated raw or undercooked meat is well documented.
