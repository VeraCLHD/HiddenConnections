Conventional detection of ESBL production remains time-consuming (24 to 48 h). Therefore, the ESBL NDP (Nordmann/Dortet/Poirel) test was developed for a rapid identification of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae. This biochemical test was based on the in vitro detection of a cephalosporin (cefotaxime) hydrolysis that is inhibited by tazobactam addition.
