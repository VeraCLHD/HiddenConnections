Abstract This study evaluated the relationship between phytate urinary levels and bone characteristics in a large population of postmenopausal women. The study population consisted of 180 postmenopausal women who participated in a descriptive cross-sectional study. A urine sample was collected from each subject to determine phytate levels and the volunteers were divided into two groups according to phytate urinary concentration (i.e., low and high levels).
