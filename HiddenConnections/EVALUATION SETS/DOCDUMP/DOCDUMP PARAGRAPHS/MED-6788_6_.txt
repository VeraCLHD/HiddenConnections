Diallyl sulfide (DAS) has been shown to prevent cancer in several animal models, presumably by metabolic modulation. We hypothesize that PhIP produces reactive oxygen species causing DNA strand breaks and that DAS will inhibit the formation of PhIP induced DNA strand breaks. To test this hypothesis we treated normal breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cells with PhIP, DAS and a combination of PhIP and DAS.
