According to the 'classical' theory, an inadequate intake of protein leads to a low plasma albumin concentration, which in turn causes oedema. This theory has been contested from several points of view: that hypoalbuminaemia is not the major factor determining the presence of oedema, and that there is no real evidence of dietary protein deficiency. The resolution of this question is of some importance from the point of view of public health diagnosis and prevention.
