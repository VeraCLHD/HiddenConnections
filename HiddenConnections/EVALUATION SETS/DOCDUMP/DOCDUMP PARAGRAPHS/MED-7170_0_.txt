Abstract OBJECTIVE Prevention of paraplegia following repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) requires understanding the anatomy and physiology of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Recent laboratory studies and clinical observations suggest that a robust collateral network must exist to explain preservation of spinal cord perfusion when segmental vessels are interrupted. An anatomical study was undertaken.
