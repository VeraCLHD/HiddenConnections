We sought association between plasma 25-OHD and stage-specific survival and tested for interaction between 25-OHD level and variation at the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene locus. Blood was sampled postoperatively, and plasma was assayed for 25-OHD by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. VDR polymorphisms (rs1544410, rs10735810, rs7975232, rs11568820) were genotyped, and haplotypes were inferred by using BEAGLE software.
