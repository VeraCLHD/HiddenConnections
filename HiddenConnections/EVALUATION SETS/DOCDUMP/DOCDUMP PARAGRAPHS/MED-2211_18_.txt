Similar results were found analyzing individual patient data for SBP (effect size, -0.5 [95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4] mm Hg; P=.27; I2=0%) and DBP (effect size, 0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.7] mm Hg; P=.38; I2=0%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any baseline factor predictive of a better response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vitamin D supplementation is ineffective as an agent for lowering BP and thus should not be used as an antihypertensive agent.
