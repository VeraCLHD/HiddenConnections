Daily supplementation with dietary nitrate was associated with reduction in blood pressure measured by 3 different methods. Mean (95% CI) reduction in clinic blood pressure was 7.7/2.4mmHg (3.6-11-8/0.0-4.9,p<0.001 and p=0.050). 24h ambulatory blood pressure was reduced by 7.7/5.2mmHg (4.1-11.2/2.7-7.7,p<0.001 for both).
