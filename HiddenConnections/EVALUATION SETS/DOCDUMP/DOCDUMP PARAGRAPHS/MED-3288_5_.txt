NFTs were seen in discrete, mostly single neurons of the structure, already noted, whereas SPs occurred in a more generalized distribution over the base and convexity of the cerebrum. The plaques were usually small (30 mu in diameter) and consisted of delicate fibrillary material. Other types of SP were also seen.
