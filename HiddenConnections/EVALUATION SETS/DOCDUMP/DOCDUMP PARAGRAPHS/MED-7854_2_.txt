Their chemical structures were identified using MS, NMR, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Antiproliferative activities of isolated compounds against Caco-2 human colon cancer cells, HepG2 human liver cancer cells, and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were evaluated. Among the compounds isolated, compounds 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, and 20 showed potent inhibitory activities against the proliferation of HepG2 cells, with EC50 values of 238.8 +/- 19.2, 120.6 +/- 7.3, 94.4 +/- 3.4, 98.9 +/- 3.3, 32.1 +/- 6.3, 306.4 +/- 131.3, 156.9 +/- 11.8, 410.3 +/- 17.4, 435.9 +/- 47.7, 202.3 +/- 42.9, and 779.3 +/- 37.4 microM, respectively.
