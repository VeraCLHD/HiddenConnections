In ROC curves, the area under the curve of black tea (0.898 (95% CI: 0.819-0.977) and vegetables-fruits (0.833 (95% CI: 0.727-0.938) provided high accuracy to distinguish between COPD group and controls (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High intakes of black tea and vegetables-fruits consumptions may be protecting male smokers from developing COPD.
