A big challenge remains to identify biomarkers for predicting who may have higher cancer risk and are able to respond to certain chemopreventive agents as well as for assessing a patientâ€™s response during treatment. Although a large body of evidence indicates that chronic inflammation is a risk factor for cancer, it is unclear whether inflammatory biomarkers can be used to predict cancer risk, progression, and death. Considering the importance of the pro-inflammatory COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in inflammation and cancers, Morris and colleagues found that urinary PGE-M is positively associated with obesity, smoking, and lung metastases in breast cancer patients (beginning on page XXX).
