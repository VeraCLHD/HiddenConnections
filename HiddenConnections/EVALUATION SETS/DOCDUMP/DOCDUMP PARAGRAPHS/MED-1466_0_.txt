Abstract BACKGROUND: Although numerous human studies have shown consistent effects of some polyphenol-rich foods on several intermediate markers for cardiovascular diseases, it is still unknown whether their action could be specifically related to polyphenols. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of orange juice and its major flavonoid, hesperidin, on microvascular reactivity, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk biomarkers through both postprandial and chronic intervention studies. DESIGN: Twenty-four healthy, overweight men (age 50-65 y) were included in a randomized, controlled, crossover study.
