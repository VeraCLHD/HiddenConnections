Abstract BACKGROUND: It was shown that men who were conceived during the Dutch famine of 1944-1945 had higher rates of obesity at age 19 y than those conceived before or after it. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the effects of prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine on obesity in women and men at age 50 y. DESIGN: We measured the body size of 741 people born at term between November 1943 and February 1947 in Amsterdam. We compared people exposed to famine in late, mid, or early gestation (exposed participants) with those born before or conceived after the famine period (nonexposed participants).
