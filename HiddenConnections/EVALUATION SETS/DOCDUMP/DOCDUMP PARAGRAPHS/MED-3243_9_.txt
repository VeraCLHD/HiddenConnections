CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence from interventional studies to support specific dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, people with IBD deserve advice based on 'best available evidence' rather than no advice at all, although dietary intake should not be inappropriately restrictive. Further interventional studies of dietary manipulation are urgently required.
