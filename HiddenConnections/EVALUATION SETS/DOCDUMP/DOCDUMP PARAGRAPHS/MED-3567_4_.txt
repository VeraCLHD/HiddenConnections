Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and at the 3- and 6-year follow-up using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Depressed mood was defined as CES-D≥20. Results At baseline, higher total carotenoids level were associated with lower probability of depressed mood (OR=0.82, 95%CI=0.68–0.99, p=0.04) after adjustment for sociodemographic, health and inflammation.
