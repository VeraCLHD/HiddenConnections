Nine cohort studies were identified by two authors, and summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS We identified nine cohort studies, including 324,141 participants and 11,400 incident cases of type 2 diabetes with follow-up ranging from 5 to 18 years. The summary adjusted RR did not show that tea consumption was associated with a reduced type 2 diabetes risk (RR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92–1.01).
