In girls only, a higher-GI diet was associated with narrower retinal arterioles (0.98-Î¼m narrowing of retinal arteriolar caliber per SD increase in GI, P = 0.01). Carbohydrate intake and a high-GL diet were associated with greater retinal fractal dimension in girls (highest compared with lowest tertiles: P-trend = 0.003 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Greater consumption of carbohydrates and soft drinks was associated with retinal arteriolar narrowing and venular widening.
