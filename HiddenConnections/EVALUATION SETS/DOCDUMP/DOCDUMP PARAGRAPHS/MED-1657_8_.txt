The subjects in the highest quartiles of these lipid profiles had significantly higher risks of NPs compared to subjects in the lower respective quartiles, which may suggest a threshold effect. Conversely, there was no relationship between any lipid profile and NFTs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that dyslipidemia increases the risk of plaque-type pathology.
