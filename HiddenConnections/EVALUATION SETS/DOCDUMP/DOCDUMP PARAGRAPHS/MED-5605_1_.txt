Increases in serum lutein and zeaxanthin were observed in previous egg interventions, but no study measured macular carotenoids. The objective of this project was to determine whether increased consumption of eggs would increase retinal lutein and zeaxanthin, or macular pigment. Twenty-four females, between 24 and 59 y, were assigned to a pill treatment (PILL) or 1 of 2 egg treatments for 12 wk.
