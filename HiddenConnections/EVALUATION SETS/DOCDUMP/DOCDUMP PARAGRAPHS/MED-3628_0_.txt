Abstract There has been an underestimation of the impact of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on an individual's functioning and quality of life (QoL). The general health status of both young and elderly individuals with IBS is generally found to be poorer than that of the general population. Patients with IBS seem to have worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than patients with certain other conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes, and end-stage renal disease.
