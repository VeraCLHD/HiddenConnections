There was no evidence of differences in the proportionate risk reductions achieved with different blood pressure-lowering regimens across groups defined according to higher or lower levels of baseline SBP (all P for trend > 0.17). This finding was broadly consistent for comparisons of different regimens, for DBP categories, and for commonly used blood pressure cut-points. CONCLUSION: It appears unlikely that the effectiveness of blood pressure-lowering treatments depends substantively upon starting blood pressure level.
