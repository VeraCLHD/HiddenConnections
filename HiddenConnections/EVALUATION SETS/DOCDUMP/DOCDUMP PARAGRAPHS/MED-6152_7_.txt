Risk of CV mortality was higher in men with CV disease prior to ED (adjusted HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.6) or with history of hospital admissions for CV events (adjusted HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3, 3.8), compared with those without the respective history. MRR was significantly increased in the 40-69 years age group (MRR 4.1; 95% CI 3.2, 5.2). The median time interval between manifestation of ED and CV death was 10.0 years.
