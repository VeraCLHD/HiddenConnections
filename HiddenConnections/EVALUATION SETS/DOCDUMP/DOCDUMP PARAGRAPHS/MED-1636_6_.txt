In the ST group, mean of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) increased significantly (p = 0.002) at the end of the study, whereas changes in apolipoprotein-A1, and lipoprotein (a) were not significant. Also, a significant decrease in the mean of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo-B100 were seen in this group. In the BT group, only HDLc showed significant change (p = 0.002) at the end of the study and changes in the other measures were not statistically significant.
