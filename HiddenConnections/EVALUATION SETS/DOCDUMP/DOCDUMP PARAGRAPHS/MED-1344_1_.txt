The objectives of the study were to: 1) evaluate the cross-sectional relation between DAL and BMD; 2) determine whether calcium intake modifies this association. Men (n=1218) and women (n=907) ≥60y were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008. Nutrient intake from 2–24h recalls was used to calculate net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and potential renal acid load (PRAL) (mEq/d).
