Abstract BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive marker of inflammation, is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a major cause of death worldwide. In epidemiological trials, high-fibre intakes have consistently been associated with reduction in CVD risk and CRP levels. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the influence of dietary fibre (DF) on CRP in clinical trials.
