Abstract Epidemiological evidence has shown that the habitual consumption of diets high in fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of cancers. The challenge is to identify causal mechanisms of effect. The aim of the current study was to determine whether an increase in rate of removal of DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) following oxidative challenge could be provoked ex vivo in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).
