Objective To determine whether fetal DHA insufficiency occurs and constrains CNS development in term gestation infants. Design A risk reduction model using a randomized prospective study of term gestation single birth healthy infants born to women (n = 270) given a placebo or 400 mg/day DHA from 16 wk gestation to delivery.
