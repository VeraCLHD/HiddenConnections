By application of computational methods for distant homology detection, comparative modeling, and molecular docking, guided by available experimental data, we have generated a three-dimensional structural model of a partial telomerase elongation complex composed of three essential protein domains bound to a single-stranded telomeric DNA sequence in the form of a heteroduplex with the template region of the human RNA subunit, TER. This model provides a structural mechanism for the processivity of telomerase and offers new insights into elongation. We conclude that the RNAâˆ¶DNA heteroduplex is constrained by the telomerase TEN domain through repeated extension cycles and that the TEN domain controls the process by moving the template ahead one base at a time by translation and rotation of the double helix.
