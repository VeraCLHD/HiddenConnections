CGE at 10 and 20 microg/mL and delphinidin at 0.6 microM concentrations significantly inhibited BP-DNA adduct formation. This was associated with a significant increase in activities of the phase II detoxification enzymes glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H:quinone reductase 1. In addition, these grape components also suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, but did not induce antioxidant response element-dependent transcription.
