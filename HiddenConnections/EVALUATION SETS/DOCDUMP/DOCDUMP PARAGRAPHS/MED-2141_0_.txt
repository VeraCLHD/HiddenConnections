Abstract BACKGROUND: Sun exposure is the single most important risk factor for skin cancer, but sun exposure may also have beneficial effects on health. We tested the hypothesis that individuals with skin cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer and cutaneous malignant melanoma) have less myocardial infarction, hip fracture and death from any cause, compared with general population controls. METHODS: We examined the entire Danish population above age 40 years from 1980 through 2006, comprising 4.4 million individuals.
