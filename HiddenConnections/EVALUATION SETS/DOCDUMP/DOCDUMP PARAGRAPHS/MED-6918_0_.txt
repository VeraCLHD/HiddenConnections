Abstract Exposure of pregnant women to organochlorine (OC) pesticides largely derives from contaminated food, but environmental, occupational, and domestic factors have also been implicated. We investigated the presence of nine OC residues in the umbilical cord blood of newborns in Southern Spain and analyzed the relationship of this exposure with maternal and pregnancy variables, including maternal adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD). OCs were detected in 95% of umbilical cord blood samples from the 318 mothers, who had a mean degree of adherence to the MD of 56.77 (SD: 16.35) (range, 0-100).
