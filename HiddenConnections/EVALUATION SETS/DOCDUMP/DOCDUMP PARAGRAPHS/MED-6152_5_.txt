RESULTS: CV mortality was 4.0%. Compared with the reference population, the risk of CV death was higher in men with ED (SMRR 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6, 3.0). Risk of CV mortality was higher in men with CV disease prior to ED (adjusted HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1, 2.6) or with history of hospital admissions for CV events (adjusted HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3, 3.8), compared with those without the respective history.
