Specifically, the offspring of gravid crickets exposed to a wolf spider Hogna helluo exhibit greater antipredator immobility in response to Hogna chemical cues than do offspring of nonexposed females. These "forewarned" crickets exhibit greater survival in the presence of Hogna than do those not forewarned. Accordingly, gravid crickets from areas with significant Hogna populations produce offspring that are more responsive to Hogna cues than do those from nearby Hogna-free areas.
