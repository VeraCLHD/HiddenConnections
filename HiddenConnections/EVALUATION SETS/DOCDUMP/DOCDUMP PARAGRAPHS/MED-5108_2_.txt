Furthermore, we hypothesized that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients display increased anti-Gal titers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We drew serum from healthy probands (n=20) weekly for 8 weeks and obtained plasma samples of from patients suffering from Crohn's disease (n=20) and ulcerative colitis (n=20). We measured anti-Gal ABs of all isotypes and total immunoglobulin (Ig) content using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.
