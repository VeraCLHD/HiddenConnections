The results from published risk assessments for these pathogen-food commodity combinations have been evaluated and conclusions regarding the relative risk of internal and external contamination of poultry meat and eggs were drawn. In conclusion, cross-contamination events from activities such as use of the same cutting board for chicken meat and salad without intermediate cleaning or spreading of pathogens via the kitchen environment seem to be of greater importance than the risk associated with undercooking of poultry meat or eggs. Risk management options are discussed against the background of risk communication strategies used in different countries.
