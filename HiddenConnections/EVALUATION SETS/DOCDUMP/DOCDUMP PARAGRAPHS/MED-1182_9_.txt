Likewise, MPOD increased in both the EGG 1 (P = 0.001) and EGG 2 (P = 0.049) groups. Although the aggregate concentration of carotenoid in 1 egg yolk may be modest relative to other sources, such as spinach, their bioavailability to the retina appears to be high. Increasing egg consumption to 6 eggs/wk may be an effective method to increase MPOD.
