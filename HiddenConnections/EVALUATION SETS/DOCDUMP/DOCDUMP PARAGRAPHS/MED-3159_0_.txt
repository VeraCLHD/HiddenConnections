Abstract The human can be thought of as a human-microbe hybrid, and the health of this superorganism will be affected by intrinsic properties such as human genetics, diurnal cycles, and age and by extrinsic factors such as lifestyle choices (food and drink, drug intake) and the acquisition of a stable "healthy" gut microflora (the so-called microbiome). Alterations in this superorganism will be manifest in the metabolite complement within its serum and urine samples. The unraveling of this metabolic compartmentalization in this complex ecosystem will certainly be a challenge for systems biology and necessary for defining human health at the molecular level.
