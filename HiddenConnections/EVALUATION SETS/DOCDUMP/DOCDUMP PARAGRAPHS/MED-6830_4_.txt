RESULTS: A total of 1,151 (21.2%) events of 5,427 total deaths were ascribed to CVD (mean followup 8.2 years). Hazard ratios (HRs) for hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level >7 mg/dl) were estimated with Cox regression model after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, hypertension, heavy cigarette smoking, and frequent alcohol consumption. In all patients, HRs were 1.16 (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.39 (P < 0.001) for total CVD, and 1.35 (P = 0.02) for ischemic stroke.
