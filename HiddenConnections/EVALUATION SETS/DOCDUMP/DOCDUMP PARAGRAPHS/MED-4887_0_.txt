Abstract CONTEXT: Restricting caloric intake is one of the most effective ways to extend lifespan and to reduce spontaneous tumor occurrence in experimental animals, but whether similar associations hold in humans has not been appropriately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether caloric restriction in early life reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study using data from the Swedish Inpatient Registry, the Swedish Cancer Registry, the Swedish Death Registry, and the Swedish Fertility Registry.
