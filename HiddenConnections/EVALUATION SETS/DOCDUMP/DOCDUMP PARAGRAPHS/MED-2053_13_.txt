In conjunction with reports that isoflavones may have a modestly beneficial impact on menopausal symptoms - perhaps reflecting the presence of ERbeta in the hypothalamus - these considerations suggest that soy isoflavone regimens of sufficient potency may represent a safe and moderately effective alternative to HRT in postmenopausal women. Further clinical research is required to characterize the impact of optimal genistein intakes on endothelial and bone function in men. Studies with ERbeta-knockout mice could be helpful for clarifying whether ERbeta does indeed mediate the chief physiological effects of low nanomolar genistein.
