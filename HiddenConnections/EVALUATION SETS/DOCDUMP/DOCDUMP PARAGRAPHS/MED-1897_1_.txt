For over two decades, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made a number of efforts to reduce dietary lead exposure of the general population, and especially of vulnerable subpopulations such as infants and children and, indirectly, the foetus. Through cooperation with infant food manufacturers, reductions of about 80-90% in the lead content of infant foods were achieved, primarily through eliminating the use of cans for infant food products and following good manufacturing practices. Another major reduction in dietary lead was realized by discontinuing the use of lead solder in domestically produced food cans.
