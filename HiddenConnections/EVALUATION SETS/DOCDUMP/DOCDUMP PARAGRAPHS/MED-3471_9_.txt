After adjusting for multiple factors, caffeine in take in the highest quartile (≥204 mg/day) was associated with any UI (prevalence odds ratio (POR)1.47, 95% CI 1.07, 2.01), but not moderate/severe UI (POR 1.42, 95% CI 0.98, 2.07). Type of UI (stress, urgency, mixed) was not associated with caffeine intake. Conclusions Caffeine intake ≥204 mg/day was associated with any UI, but not moderate/severe UI, in US women.
