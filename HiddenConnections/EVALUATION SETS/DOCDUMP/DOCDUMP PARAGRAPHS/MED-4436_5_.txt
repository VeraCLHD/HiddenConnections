RESULTS: The inhibition of ADP-, collagen-, thrombin-, and arachidonate-mediated platelet aggregation by tomato extract components appears to be linked to the inhibition of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and platelet secretory mechanisms. We found a significant inhibition of baseline platelet function, from 2.9 +/- 1.4% (optimal ADP concentrations; P = 0.03) to 20.0 +/- 4.9% (suboptimal ADP concentrations; P < 0.001), 3 h after supplementation with a dose of tomato extract equivalent to 6 tomatoes. The observed effects persisted for >12 h. Coagulation variables were not affected.
