Differences in physiochemical properties and lesion depths between beverages were investigated using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD test. Relationships among lesion depths and physiochemical properties were evaluated using the Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: pH, titratable acidity and fluoride concentrations differed between tea flavors (P < 0.05) and between brands (P < 0.05).
