This is a secondary, observational data analysis using data from PREMIER, an 18-month randomized clinical trial that enrolled a total of 810 participants. Participants completed group and individual sessions designed to help them improve blood pressure (BP) control by making lifestyle changes. Dietary intakes were assessed by two 24-h diet recalls at baseline, 6, and 18 months.
