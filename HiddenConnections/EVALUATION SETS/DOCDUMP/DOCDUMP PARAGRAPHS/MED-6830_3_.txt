Mortality from all causes, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischemic stroke, congestive heart failure, hypertensive disease, and coronary heart disease were compared according to increasing serum uric acid levels. RESULTS: A total of 1,151 (21.2%) events of 5,427 total deaths were ascribed to CVD (mean followup 8.2 years). Hazard ratios (HRs) for hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level >7 mg/dl) were estimated with Cox regression model after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, hypertension, heavy cigarette smoking, and frequent alcohol consumption.
