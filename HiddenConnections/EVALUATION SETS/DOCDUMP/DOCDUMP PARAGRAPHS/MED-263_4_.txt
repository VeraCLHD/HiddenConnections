The subjects of three groups ran on treadmill according to Bruce test. Heart rate, time of running, VO2max, VO2, VE and RER were measured by Gas Analyzer. After collecting the data, ANOVA was done (p < 0.05) and the results showed that in this study the inhaling of fragrant odors did not have any significant effect on the time of running, MHR, VO2max, VO2, VE and RER, which we think is due to the intensity and duration of training.
