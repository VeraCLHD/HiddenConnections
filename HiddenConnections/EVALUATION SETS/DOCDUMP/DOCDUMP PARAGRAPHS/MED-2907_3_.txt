Following a baseline examination for plaque, gingival inflammation and bleeding, 75 qualified healthy adult males and females, ages 18-70 were selected to participate in the study. Dental prophylaxis was performed and subjects were provided with two tubes of toothpaste (Colgate Total) and a soft-bristle toothbrush (Colgate Wave Toothbrush). The subjects were instructed to brush twice daily using a modified Bass brushing technique.
