Then cellular Cd uptake from the digests and reference CdCl2 solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: Cd bioavailability from animal-based foods was higher than that from vegetable-based foods. In addition, raw kale exhibited an inhibitory effect on Cd bioavailability when mixed with boiled pig kidney.
