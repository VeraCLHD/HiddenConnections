STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of a birth cohort in the Faroe Islands, where 878 of eligible children (87%) were examined at age 14 years. Latencies of brainstem evoked potential peaks I, III, and V at 20 and 40 Hz constituted the outcome variables. Mercury concentrations were determined in cord blood and maternal hair, and in the child's hair at ages 7 and 14.
