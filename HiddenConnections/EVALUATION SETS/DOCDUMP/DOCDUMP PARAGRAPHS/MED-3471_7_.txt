Results From the 4309 non-pregnant women (aged ≥20 years) who had complete UI and dietary data, UI prevalence for any UI was 41.0% and 16.5% for moderate/severe UI, with stress UI the most common UI type (36.6%). Women consumed a mean caffeine intake of 126.7 mg/day. After adjusting for multiple factors, caffeine in take in the highest quartile (≥204 mg/day) was associated with any UI (prevalence odds ratio (POR)1.47, 95% CI 1.07, 2.01), but not moderate/severe UI (POR 1.42, 95% CI 0.98, 2.07).
