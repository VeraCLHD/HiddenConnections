Severity of symptoms was directly proportional to duration (number of affected cycles) (R = 0.78). A linear model found that symptom prevalence (duration Ã— severity) was associated with age (linear and quadratic effects), parity, current smoking and country. Premenstrual physical and mental symptom domains had similar negative effects on ADL.
