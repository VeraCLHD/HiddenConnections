More importantly, it has yet to be determined whether treatment strategies guided by, or targeting, these measures improve cardiovascular outcomes. Drug therapies known to alter advanced lipoprotein analysis parameters, specifically niacin and fenofibrate, have not been shown to additionally reduce cardiovascular risk in recent randomized trials of high-risk patients treated with statin therapy. These findings suggest advanced lipoprotein analysis-guided strategies may not further reduce cardiovascular events and could lead to increased adverse effects and costs; this approach needs further research to establish its role in individualizing therapies for cardiovascular prevention.
