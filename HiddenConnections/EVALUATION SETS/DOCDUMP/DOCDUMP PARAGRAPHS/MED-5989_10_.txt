These results reinforce the notion that high longevity in homeothermic vertebrates is achieved in part by constitutively decreasing the sensitivity of both tissue proteins and lipids to oxidative damage. This is obtained by modifying the constituent structural components of proteins and lipids, selecting those less sensitive to oxidative modifications.
