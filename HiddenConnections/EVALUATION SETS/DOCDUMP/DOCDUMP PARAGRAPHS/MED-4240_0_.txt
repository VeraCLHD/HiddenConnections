Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes a major global health and socio-economic problem with neurobehavioral sequelae contributing to long-term disability. It causes brain swelling, axonal injury and hypoxia, disrupts blood brain barrier function and increases inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, neurodegeneration and leads to cognitive impairment. Epidemiological studies show that 30% of patients, who die of TBI, have AÎ² plaques which are pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
