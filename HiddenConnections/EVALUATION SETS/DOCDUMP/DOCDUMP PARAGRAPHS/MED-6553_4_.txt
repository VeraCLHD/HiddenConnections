RESULTS: Compared with nondiabetic subjects, diabetic patients had higher fasting IL-8 (P < 0.05) and IL-18 (P < 0.01) concentrations and lower adiponectin concentrations (P < 0.01) at baseline. In both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, IL-18 concentrations increased and adiponectin concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) from baseline concentrations after consumption of the high-fat meal. After consumption of the high-carbohydrate, high-fiber meal, serum IL-18 concentrations decreased from baseline concentrations (P < 0.05) in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects; adiponectin concentrations decreased after the high-carbohydrate, low-fiber meal in diabetic patients.
