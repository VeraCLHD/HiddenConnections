Plasma total phenolics and quercetin levels were not associated with FRAP and serum DPPH radical-scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that rapid consumption of apple juice increased plasma antioxidant activity in healthy subjects; this was caused by the fructose-induced rise of serum uric acid levels, but was not due to the presence of antioxidant polyphenols in juice. Thus, short-term consumption of apple juice seems not to be the effective dietary intervention to augment plasma antioxidant activity due to the concomitant possibility for uric acid to be a risk factor for several diseases, as verified by other authors.
