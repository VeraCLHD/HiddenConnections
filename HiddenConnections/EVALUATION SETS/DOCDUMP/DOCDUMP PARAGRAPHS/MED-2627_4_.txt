On the other hand, physical exercise can also elicit systemic molecular pathways connected with angiogenesis and chronic anti-inflammatory action with consequent modification of the endothelial function. However, its benefit depends on the type and intensity of training performed. While strenuous exercise increases oxidative metabolism and produces a pro-oxidant environment, only regular moderate physical activity promotes an antioxidant state and preserves endothelial function.
