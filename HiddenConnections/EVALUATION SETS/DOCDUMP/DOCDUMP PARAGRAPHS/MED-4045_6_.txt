Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography was performed in 58 and liver biopsy in 34 patients. RESULTS: In patients, consumption of whole grains was associated with lower abdominal fat level (β = -0.24, p = 0.02) and lower levels of insulin resistance index (β = -0.28, p = 0.009), while it also correlated inversely with interleukin-6 levels (ρ = -0.23, p = 0.05). Consumption of whole grains was associated with lower likelihood of having histological steatohepatitis (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-1.000), after adjusting for sex and energy intake, but the association became weaker after further adjusting for abdominal fat or interleukin-6 levels.
