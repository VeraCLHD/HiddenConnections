The PBL were isolated from apparently healthy volunteers following dietary intervention with: (1) a mixed carotene capsule; (2) a daily portion of cooked minced carrots; (3) a matched placebo; (4) a portion of mandarin oranges; (5) vitamin C tablets. Single-cell gel electrophoresis was employed to measure baseline levels of SSB and DNA susceptibility to oxidative damage, and to monitor the number of SSB over 4 h, in both unchallenged and H2O2-treated PBL. The enzymatic capacity for repair of different types of DNA oxidative lesions was also measured using two related cell-free assays.
