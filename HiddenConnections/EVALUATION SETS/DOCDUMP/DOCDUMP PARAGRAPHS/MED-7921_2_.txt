In this comparative, double-blind study, we examined 160 subjects who ingested either cocoa powder containing low-polyphenolic compounds (placebo-cocoa group) or 3 levels of cocoa powder containing high-polyphenolic compounds (13, 19.5, and 26 g/d for low-, middle-, and high-cocoa groups, respectively) for 4 wk. The test powders were consumed as a beverage after the addition of hot water, twice each day. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 4 wk after intake of the test beverages for the measurement of plasma lipids.
