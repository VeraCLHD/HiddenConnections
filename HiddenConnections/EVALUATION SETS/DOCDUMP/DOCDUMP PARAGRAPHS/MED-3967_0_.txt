Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the life history consequences of cow milk consumption at different stages in early life (prenatal to adolescence), especially with regard to linear growth and age at menarche and the role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in mediating a relationship among milk, growth and development, and long-term biological outcomes. METHODS: United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2004 and review of existing literature. RESULTS: The literature tends to support milk's role in enhancing growth early in life (prior to age 5 years), but there is less support for this relationship during middle childhood.
