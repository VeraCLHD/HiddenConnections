In parallel, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) decreased progressively, reaching a minimum of 60.4 +/- 5.4% of baseline after 6 h. Over time, the GIR was strongly correlated with IMCL in TA (r = -0.98, P < or = 0.003) and SOL muscle (r = -0.97, P < or = 0.005). In the diet protocol, 12 male subjects ingested both a high-fat and low-fat diet for 3 days each. Before and after completion of each diet, IMCL levels and insulin sensitivity were assessed.
