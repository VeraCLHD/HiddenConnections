Each subject's protein requirement was estimated by using linear regression of protein intake and nitrogen balance data from all 3 trials and inverse prediction. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) protein requirement was not different between the younger and older subjects: 0.61 +/- 0.14 compared with 0.58 +/- 0.12 g protein x kg body wt(-1) . d(-1).
