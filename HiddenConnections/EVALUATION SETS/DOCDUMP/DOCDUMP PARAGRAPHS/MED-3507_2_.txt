MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysis. RESULTS: In the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted, with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest duration. In the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductions.
