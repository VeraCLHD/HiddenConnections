NAFLD severity ranges from simple steatosis to acute steatohepatitis, but the molecular mechanisms controlling progression of this disease are poorly understood. Recent literature suggests that elevated free fatty acids (FFAs), especially saturated FFAs, may play an important role in lipotoxic mechanisms, both in experimental models and in NAFLD patients. This review highlights important cellular pathways involved in hepatic lipotoxicity and how the degree of intrahepatic lipid saturation controls cell fate in response to an elevated FFA load.
