Abstract OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the long-term effect of commonly used whole soy foods (soy flour) and purified daidzein (one major isoflavone and the precursor of equol) on renal function among prehypertensive postmenopausal women who are also equol producers, a population most likely to benefit from soy intervention. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 6-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundred seventy eligible Chinese women were randomized to either one of the three treatments: 40 g soy flour (whole soy group), 40 g low-fat milk powder + 63 mg daidzein (daidzein group) or 40 g low-fat milk powder (placebo group) daily each for 6 months.
