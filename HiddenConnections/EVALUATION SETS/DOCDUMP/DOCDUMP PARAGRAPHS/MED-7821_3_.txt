A third group ingested 50 g of soy and 3 g of green tea daily, and the control group had a hypocholesterolemic diet. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 45 and 90 d. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and triacylglycerols were evaluated by automated methods. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation.
