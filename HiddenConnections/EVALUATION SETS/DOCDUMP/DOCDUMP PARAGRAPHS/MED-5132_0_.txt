Abstract During the last decades, nuts have attracted the attention of researchers for their potential benefits in cardiovascular prevention. We discuss here some aspects of the assumed beneficial effects of nuts, weighing them against potential harm. Epidemiological observations and controlled intervention trials consistently suggest that nuts consumption is associated with improved serum lipid profile, thus helping decrease cardiovascular risk.
