The lactic acid bacteria count decreased significantly during the storage time for the cheeses from both low- and high-SCC milks, but at a faster rate for the cheese from high-SCC milk. Cheeses from high-SCC milk presented lower psychrotrophic bacteria counts and higher yeast and mold counts than cheeses from low-SCC milk. Cheeses from low-SCC milk showed better overall acceptance by the consumers.
