Specifically, it is unclear whether atherosclerosis can cause the neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that define Alzheimer neuropathology and whether atherosclerosis, a potentially reversible risk factor, can influence cognition independent of brain infarcts. Methods We examined the relationship between systemic atherosclerosis, Alzheimer type pathology and dementia in autopsies from 200 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a prospective study of the effect of aging on cognition, 175 of whom had complete body autopsies. Results Using a quantitative analysis of atherosclerosis in the aorta, heart and intracranial vessels, we found no relationship between the degree of atherosclerosis in any of these systems and the degree of Alzheimerâ€™s type brain pathology.
