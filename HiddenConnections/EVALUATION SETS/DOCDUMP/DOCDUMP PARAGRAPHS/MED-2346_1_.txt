Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), i.e. total cholesterol minus HDL, is a well-established risk factor for CVD; however, its association with NAFLD development has not been established.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 213 subjects from the general population, without liver disease, was studied.
