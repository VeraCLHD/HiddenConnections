Abstract Increasing evidence suggests that acetaldehyde, the first and genotoxic metabolite of ethanol, mediates the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages. Ethanol is also contained in a number of ready-to-use mouthwashes typically between 5 and 27% vol. An increased risk of oral cancer has been discussed for users of such mouthwashes; however, epidemiological evidence had remained inconclusive.
