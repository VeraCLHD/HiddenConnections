Energy from TFA was compared to energy from all other sources, carbohydrates or unsaturated cis-fatty acids with different multivariable models. During follow-up, 3870 subjects died of CVD, 2383 of CHD, 732 of cerebrovascular diseases and 243 of sudden death. Significant risks, comparing highest to lowest intake category, were found for: TFA from PHVO and CHD (HR 1.23 (95 % CI 1.00, 1.50)) and cerebrovascular diseases (HR 0.65 (95 % CI 0.45, 0.94)); TFA from PHFO and CVD (HR 1.14 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.26)) and cerebrovascular diseases (HR 1.32 (95 % CI 1.04, 1.69)); and rTFA intake and CVD (HR 1.30 (95 % CI 1.05, 1.61)), CHD (HR 1.50 (95 % CI 1.11, 2.03)) and sudden death (HR 2.73 (95 % CI 1.19, 6.25)) in women.
