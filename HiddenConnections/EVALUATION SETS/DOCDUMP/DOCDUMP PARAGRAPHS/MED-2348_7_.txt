In conclusion, dietary habits may promote steatohepatitis directly by modulating hepatic triglyceride accumulation and antioxidant activity as well as indirectly by affecting insulin sensitivity and postprandial triglyceride metabolism. Our findings provide further rationale for more specific alimentary interventions, particularly in nonobese, nondiabetic normolipidemic NASH patients.
