Instillation of a solution containing short-chain fatty acids twice daily resulted in the disappearance of symptoms and the inflammatory changes observed at endoscopy, over a period of four to six weeks. Remission has been maintained for up to 14 months (in one patient) by instillation daily to twice weekly. Administering enemas containing isotonic saline, or omitting treatment for periods of two to four weeks during the regimen, by contrast, did not produce any improvement or rapid relapse of the colitis.
