Secondary outcomes are change in markers of bone metabolism between groups, death rates between groups, and the number of subjects proceeding to renal replacement therapy across groups. Adverse events, such as worsening of arterial hypertension due to the additional sodium consumption, will be accurately monitored. Discussion We hypothesize that sufficiently balanced acidâ€“base homeostasis leads to a reduction of decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease.
