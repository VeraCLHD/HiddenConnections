In in vivo distribution studies with conventional biochemical assays, target cell populations associated with non-target tissues frequently remain unrecognized without the resolution achieved by cellular autoradiography. Autoradiography, alone or combined with immunohistochemistry when applied to in vivo drug targeting and target characterization, has provided information on cellular-subcellular receptor distribution in over 50 tissues. These discoveries, importantly, contribute to a new understanding of the biological role of vitamin D and challenge the concept of "the calcium homeostatic steroid hormone" as being too narrow.
