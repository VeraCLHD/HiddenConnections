Several research studies have provided in-depth analysis of multiple targets through which curcumin induces protective effects against cancers including gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecological, hematological, pulmonary, thymic, brain, breast, and bone. The molecular mechanisms of action of curcumin in treating different types of cancers remain under investigation. The multifaceted role of this dietary agent is mediated through its inhibition of several cell signaling pathways at multiple levels.
