Abstract BACKGROUND: We previously reported that 'benifuuki' green tea containing O-methylated catechin significantly relieved the symptoms of perennial or seasonal rhinitis compared with a placebo green tea that did not contain O-methylated catechin in randomized double-blind clinical trials. In this study we assessed the effects of 'benifuuki' green tea on clinical symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. METHODS: An open-label, single-dose, randomized, parallel-group study was performed on 38 subjects with Japanese cedar pollinosis.
