Abstract The properties of N-nitroso compounds (NNC) and of vitamins C and E are briefly described. The author reviews the ability of vitamins C and E to inhibit NNC formation in chemical systems, in nitrite-preserved meat, in experimental animals and in humans. Dietary vitamins C and E both produced 30% to 60% inhibitions in most carcinogenesis experiments employing preformed carcinogens.
