Abstract Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection satisfactory for sexual performance. Evidence is accumulating to consider ED as a vascular disorder. Common risk factors for atherosclerosis are frequently found in association with ED, and ED is frequently reported in vascular syndromes, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and diabetes mellitus.
