Abstract Background Effect of fish oil supplementation on flow-mediated dilation, an index of endothelial function in humans, remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to determine whether fish oil supplementation could improve endothelial function. Methods Human intervention studies were identified by systematic searches of Medline, Embase, Cochrane's library and references of related reviews and studies.
