Suppression was also obtained with A23187-stimulated rat peritoneal mast cells. The extent of inhibition of these 2 markers of the immune response was accompanied by an influx of calcium ions. The inhibition of the immune process by the pigmented brans was confirmed by the observed modulation of the proinflammatory cytokine gene expressions and cytokine release, as indicated by the reduction in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, and IL-6 mRNA expressions determined with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
