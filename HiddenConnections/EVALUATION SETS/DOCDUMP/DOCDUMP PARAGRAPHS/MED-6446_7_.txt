RESULTS: Allergic patients showed a significantly higher frequency of CD3(+)CD161(+), CD4(+)CD161(+) and CD8(+)CD161(+) cells than healthy non-allergic subjects (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the expression of CD161 cells was significantly related to clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that a higher frequency of CD161(+) T cells is present in the peripheral blood of AR patients.
