Fourteen healthy salt resistant adults were studied (9M, 5F; age 33 ± 2.4 years) in a controlled feeding study. After a baseline run-in diet, participants were randomized to a 7 day high sodium (HS) (300-350 mmol/day) and 7 day low sodium (LS) (20 mmol/day) diet. Salt resistance, defined as a ≤ 5 mm Hg change in a 24-hour mean arterial pressure, was individually assessed while on the low sodium and high sodium diets and confirmed in the subjects undergoing study (LS: 85±1 mm Hg; HS: 85±2 mmHg).
