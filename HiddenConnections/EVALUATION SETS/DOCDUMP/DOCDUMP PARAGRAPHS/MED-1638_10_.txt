These changes were more clearly observed when the data for each subject was presented individually. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a uricosuric effect of Roselle calyces. Since the various chemical constituents in Roselle calyces have been identified, the one(s) exerting this uricosuric effect need to be identified.
