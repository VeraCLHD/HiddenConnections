Abstract Background Over 320,000 hip fractures occur in North America each year and they are associated with a mortality rate ranging from 14% to 36% within 1 year of surgery. We assessed whether mortality and reoperation rates have improved in hip fracture patients over the past 31 years. Methods 3 electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on hip fracture management, published between 1950 and 2013.
