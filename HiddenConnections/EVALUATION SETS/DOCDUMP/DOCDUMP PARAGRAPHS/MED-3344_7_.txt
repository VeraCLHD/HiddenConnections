TRL carotenoid concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector. Considering all carotenoids, absorption expressed as area under the curve was greatest when ≥75% of vegetables were consumed in a single meal (P < .05). Absorption of carotenes also followed this trend (P < .05 for α- and β-carotene).
