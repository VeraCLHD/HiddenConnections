Abstract A few patients remain severely affected by atopic dermatitis into adult life despite treatment with systemic steroids, azathioprine, and photochemotherapy. 33 patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of cyclosporin (5 mg/kg per day) in adults with severe refractory atopic dermatitis. Treatments were given for eight weeks each with one group (n = 16) receiving placebo followed by cyclosporin and another (n = 17) receiving cyclosporin and then placebo.
