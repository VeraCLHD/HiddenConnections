The ratio of dietary protein, the major source of nonvolatile acid, to dietary potassium, which is naturally bound to alkali precursors, can be used to estimate net endogenous acid production (NEAP). We tested the association between estimated NEAP and serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements NEAP was estimated among 462 African American adults with hypertensive CKD using published equations: NEAP (mEq/d) = âˆ’10.2 + 54.5 (protein [g/d]/potassium [mEq/d]).
