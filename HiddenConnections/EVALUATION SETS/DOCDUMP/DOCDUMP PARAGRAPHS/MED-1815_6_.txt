Thereafter, GM increased more slowly and reached a plateau in the 4th decade; it decreased by 13% in the oldest volunteers. The GM-WM ratio decreased exponentially from early childhood through the 4th decade; thereafter, it gradually declined. In vivo patterns of change in the intracranial space, whole brain, and GM-WM ratio agreed with published postmortem data.
