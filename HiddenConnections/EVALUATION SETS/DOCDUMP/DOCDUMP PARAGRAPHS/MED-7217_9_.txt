Also, consumption of four cups of green tea per day (2 g) significantly decreased excretion of NDMA during days 4-7 (p=0.0035), but not during days 1-3. Surprisingly, consumption of eight cups of green tea per day (4 g) significantly increased NDMA excretion during days 4-7 (p=0.0001), again not during days 1-3. This increase is probably a result of catalytic effects of tea polyphenols on nitrosation, or of another, yet unknown, mechanism.
