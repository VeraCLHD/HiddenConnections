Based on IPD cases detected up to June 30, 1994, the age-adjusted incidence rate in smokers was less than half that in nonsmokers: 34.4 versus 94.2 cases per 100,000 person-years of pre-illness follow-up, respectively. When data were stratified by 5-year age group, lower IPD incidence in smokers was observed at all ages between 50 and 90 years. Age-specific mortality trends for smokers and nonsmokers with and without IPD suggested that increased mortality in IPD patients was mostly associated with IPD itself and not with smoking.
