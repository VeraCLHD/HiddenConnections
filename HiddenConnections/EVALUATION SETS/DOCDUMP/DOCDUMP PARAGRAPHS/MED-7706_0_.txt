Abstract Objective To test the effect of four polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCB-77, PCB-105, PCB 153 and PCB 180) on expression of three adhesion markers, TGF-Î²1, VEGF, and type I collagen in normal human peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts Design Cell culture study Settings University Research Laboratory Patients Primary cultures of normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts were established from three patients. Interventions Fibroblasts were treated with PCB-77, PCB-105, PCB-153 or PCB-180, 20 ppm for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from each treatment and subjected to real-time RT/PCR.
