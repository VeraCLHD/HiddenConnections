Mean decreases in plasma cholesterol, 16 and 13%, for responders in the animal and soy groups were significant, p less than 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. Responders in both groups had higher initial plasma cholesterol values than nonresponders. Although plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased slightly, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to cholesterol ratio (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol) remained constant for most individuals.
