Further, we assessed the anti-oxidative effect against LDL after balsamic vinegar consumption in human subjects. Balsamic vinegar prolonged the LDL oxidation lag time and decreased lipid peroxide (LPO) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) in LDL particles. We next examined the effect of balsamic vinegar on foam cell formation.
