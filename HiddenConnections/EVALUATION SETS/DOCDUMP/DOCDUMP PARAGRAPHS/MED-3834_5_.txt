Acid exposure for each hour over a 3-h postprandial (PP) period was assessed as the percent time pH less than 4.0. Increased upright acid exposure occurred in normals after the high fat (6.2 +/- 2.1%; mean +/- SE) compared with the low fat meal (1.5 +/- 0.5%; p less than 0.05). GER patients had greater (p less than 0.05) acid exposure than normals in all study periods, but no differences were found between low and high fat meals in either study position.
