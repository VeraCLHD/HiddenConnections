Subjects with sensitive skin had mainly dry (34.5%) or mixed skin (35.7%), fair phototypes, dermatological disorders, higher skin reactivity to cosmetics and various environmental factors in comparison with subjects who stated having only a "slightly" sensitive or not sensitive skin. The dermatologist had a strong influence on subjects with "sensitive" or "very sensitive" skin through the prescription of skin care products. CONCLUSION: This study, based on a representative sample of the American population, reveals a high prevalence of sensitive skin in the USA.
