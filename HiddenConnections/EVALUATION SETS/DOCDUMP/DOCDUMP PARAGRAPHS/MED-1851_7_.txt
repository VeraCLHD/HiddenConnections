Dietary intake of RS was associated with higher concentrations of faecal ammonia (r = 0.34, P < 0.05), but this association was reversed when RS was combined with NSP in the diet (r = 0.07, NS). In contrast to dietary intake, the faecal excretion of RS was negatively related to faecal ammonia concentration (r = -0.40, P < 0.01) and positively related to faecal output (r = 0.64, P < 0.01). Individuals who consumed more NSP in their diet (19 +/- 7 g/d) excreted more than 150 g faeces per day and had higher quantities of faecal-RS and -NSP; faster transit times; higher concentrations of short chain fatty acids and lower concentrations of potentially harmful ammonia and phenols.
