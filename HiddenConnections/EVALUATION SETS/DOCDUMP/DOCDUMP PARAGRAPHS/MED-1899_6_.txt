The summary RR for each 100 mg/day increment in dietary vitamin C was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.93) (10 studies), and for each 20 μmol/L increment in circulating vitamin C was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75 to 0.88) (5 studies). Few studies reported results for vitamin C supplements (RR for high‐versus‐low intake=0.83, 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.10, 3 studies). Conclusions This meta‐analysis suggests significant inverse relationships between dietary vitamin C intake, circulating vitamin C, and risk of stroke.
