Abstract BACKGROUND: Studies of single nutrients on depression have produced inconsistent results, and they have failed to consider the complex interactions between nutrients. An increasing number of studies in recent years are investigating the association of overall dietary patterns and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review current literature and conduct meta-analyses of studies addressing the association between dietary patterns and depression.
