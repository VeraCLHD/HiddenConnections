In the future this technique may be applied to study the influence of smoking, mechanical loading of the discs, abnormal posture, and atherosclerosis of the lumbar arteries on diffusion. These conditions have all been implicated in disc degeneration through a final common pathway of altered diffusion and decreased nutrition. This review article focuses on the current knowledge, methodology, various factors that influence the diffusion properties of the discs, and future applications of this promising technique.
