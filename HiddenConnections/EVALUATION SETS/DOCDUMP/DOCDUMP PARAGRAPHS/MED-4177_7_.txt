As for TG, those values were 155.68 +/- 119.84 mg/dl and 81.67 +/- 81.90 mg/dl (p < 0.01). As for HDL level no difference was reported between the samples, but HDL/TC ratio was significantly higher in vegans (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Vegetarian diet was associated to lower levels of TG, TC and LDL as compared to the diet of omnivores.
