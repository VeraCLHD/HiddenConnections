Baseline characteristics were similar between VD-insufficient and VD-sufficient groups. The incidence of SCF was significantly higher in the VD-insufficient group than in patients with sufficient VD (relative risk=3.5, 95% confidence interval=1.1-10.5, P=0.01). After adjusting for cardiovascular disease risk factors, VD insufficiency was independently associated with SCF.
