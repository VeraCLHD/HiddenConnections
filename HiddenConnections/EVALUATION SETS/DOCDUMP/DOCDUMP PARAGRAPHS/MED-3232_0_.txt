Abstract The premature presence of senile plaques (SP) in coronary artery disease (CAD), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) as well as SP in hypertension (HyperT), suggest a neuropathologic link between CAD, HyperT, and AD. Previous MI, CAD and HyperT often occur in and may increase the risk of AD. Expression of Apo-E4 likely increases risk of CAD by elevating blood cholesterol and the risk of AD via proposed interactions with beta-amyloid and/or free radicals (FRs).
