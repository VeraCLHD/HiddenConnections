Meta-analyses using random effects models were performed to estimate pooled hazard ratios. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded five studies including 2330 colorectal cancer patients and five studies including 4413 breast cancer patients all of which compared mortality across two to five categories of 25(OH)D levels. Among colorectal cancer patients, pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing highest with lowest categories were 0.71 (0.55-0.91) and 0.65 (0.49-0.86) for overall and disease-specific mortality, respectively.
