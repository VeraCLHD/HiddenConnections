Abstract Studies of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam direct suspicion to a heat-labile component of vegetables found in greatest concentration in seeds. We therefore surveyed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) regarding early adult consumption of fruits and vegetables usually eaten raw, with seeds that are swallowed or scraped with the teeth. We administered a pretested questionnaire by telephone to 81 nondemented patients with PD and to a same-sex married sibling without PD.
