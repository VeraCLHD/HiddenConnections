The lipid levels in the vegetarian sample were similar to levels reported in the literature (mean, 4.23%, range, 1.23-7.4%). For the 7 contaminants reported for U. S. women by Rogan et al. and Savage, we compared the concentrations in the vegetarian women. For every contaminant except polychlorinated biphenyls, in which there were no strong differences between groups, there was no overlap in the range of scores; the highest vegetarian value was lower than the lowest value obtained in the U. S. sample.
