Abstract Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus that commonly infects cattle and causes B cell leukosis in 1-5% of infected cattle. BLV-infected cells are present in marketed beef and dairy products. In the decade after the discovery of BLV in 1969, studies using agar gel immunodiffusion and complement fixation assays failed to find antibodies to BLV in human sera.
