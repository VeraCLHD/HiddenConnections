Hydrolytic degradation of the chitin polymer is essential for hyphal growth, branching, and septum formation in fungal systems as well as for the normal molting of arthropods. Recently, insect chitinase activity was strongly and specifically suppressed by allosamidin, an actimomycetes-derived metabolite. In part, the defense mechanism in plants against invasion of pathogens is associated with induced chitinases.
