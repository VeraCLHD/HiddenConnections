Total energy and carbohydrate intake tended to be higher in the obese group. A characteristic feature was that dietary cholesterol intake was significantly higher, while the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was significantly lower in the non-obese group. CONCLUSIONS: In non-obese NAFLD patients: 1) although visceral fat was increased, insulin resistance and/or dysregulated secretion of adipocytokines was not necessarily shown; 2) intakes of total energy and carbohydrates were not excessive, although dietary cholesterol was superabundant and dietary PUFAs were significantly lower compared with those in obese patients; and 3) characteristic fat intake may be associated with the formation of NAFLD.
