Abstract Cicely Williams, in her original description of kwashiorkor, implied that deficiency of protein in the baby's food could be a main cause of the syndrome. The hallmark of kwashiorkor is oedema. According to the 'classical' theory, an inadequate intake of protein leads to a low plasma albumin concentration, which in turn causes oedema.
