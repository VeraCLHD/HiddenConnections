Most studies of protected environments have included patients who receive prophylactic oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, prophylactic systemic antibiotics, or oral absorbable antibiotics (selective decontamination). Another variable that needs to be considered is the use of sterile food--included in some studies, not used in others, and not mentioned in still others. No studies have used the only appropriate control, which is the same laminar airflow room, but with the airflow turned off and without gowns, masks, or gloves, only assiduous hand-washing.
