METHODS: Ankle and brachial systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cAIx, ABI, and heart rate (HR) were evaluated in the supine position in 14 adults (11 women/3 men, age 58 ± 1 years) with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (153 ± 4 mm Hg). Subjects were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of watermelon extract supplementation (L-citrulline/L-arginine, 6 g daily) or placebo followed by a 2-week washout period and then crossover. RESULTS: Ankle and brachial SBP (-11.5 ± 3.8 and -15.1 ± 2.8 mm Hg), DBP (-7.8 ± 2.3 and -7.6 ± 1.8 mm Hg), and MAP (-9.8 ± 2.6 and -7.3 ± 1.8 mm Hg), and cAIx (-8.8 ± 2.6 %) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after watermelon supplementation compared to placebo.
