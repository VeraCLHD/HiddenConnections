Four RCTs reported on the progression to new diabetes and found no effect of vitamin D (odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10, I2 = 0%). Adverse events were rare, and there was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: Evidence from available trials shows no effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on glucose homeostasis or diabetes prevention.
