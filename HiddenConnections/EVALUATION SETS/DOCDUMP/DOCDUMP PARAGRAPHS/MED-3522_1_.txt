This increase in metabolic rate was originally called 'specific dynamic action' (SDA) and is now widely referred to as the thermic effect (TE) of food or diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) (Rothwell & Stock, 1981). Much of the early work on the thermic effect was confined to the type and amount of food, notably the macronutrients--proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Later, it was shown that certain minor constituents of the diet such as caffeine and associated methylxanthines (Zahorska-Markrewicz, 1980; Jung et al., 1981) in tea and coffee could also have a profound effect on metabolic rate.
