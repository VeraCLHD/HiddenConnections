After the high-fat meal, the decrease in blood pressure in response to L-arginine was reduced (-1 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), and platelet aggregation showed a paradoxical increase (4.1 +/- 2.1%; P < 0.01 compared with the high-carbohydrate meal). The high-fat meal with antioxidants partially restored the vascular response to L-arginine. CONCLUSION: Compared with a high-carbohydrate meal, a high-fat meal can modify endothelial functions toward a more atherogenetic profile, which is partially prevented by dietary antioxidants.
