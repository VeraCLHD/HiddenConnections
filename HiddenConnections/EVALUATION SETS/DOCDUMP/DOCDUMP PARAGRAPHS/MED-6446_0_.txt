Abstract BACKGROUND: Th17 is a subset of T-helper lymphocytes that produce proinflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-17. Serum IL-17 is increased in allergic patients and relates to clinical severity. Recently, it has been reported that CD161 is a highly upregulated gene in Th17 clones and all IL-17-producing cells are contained in CD161(+) T cells.
