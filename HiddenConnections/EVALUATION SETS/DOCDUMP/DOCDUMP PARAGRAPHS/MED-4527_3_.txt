Of the patients, 56 had varicocele, eight had varicocele with prostatitis, 35 had vasectomy reversals, and 28 had idiopathic infertility. ROS levels were higher among infertile men, especially those with varicocele with prostatitis (mean +/- SE, 3.25 +/- 0.89) and vasectomy reversals (2.65 +/- 1.01). All infertile groups had significantly lower ROS-TAC scores than control.
