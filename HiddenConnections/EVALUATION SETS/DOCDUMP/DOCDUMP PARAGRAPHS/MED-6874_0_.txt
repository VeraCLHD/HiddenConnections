Abstract Swine have been identified as the primary reservoir of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica (YE), but little research has focused on the epidemiology of YE at the farm level. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of YE in different production phases on swine farms. In this cross-sectional study, individual pigs on eight swine operations were sampled for the presence of YE.
