Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs assessing different intervention and control diets in 192 patients (97 randomised to intervention diet; 95 to control diet) with different types of malignancies. Co-interventions (e.g. protective environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, central venous catheter care, oral care, hygiene practices and colony-stimulating factors) and outcome definitions also differed between studies.
