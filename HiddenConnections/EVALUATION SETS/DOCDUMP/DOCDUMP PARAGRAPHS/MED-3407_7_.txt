In addition, bile acids may also act as regulatory molecules involved in different cell signaling pathways in colon cells. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that the continuous exposure to certain hydrophobic bile acids, due to a fat-rich diet or pathological conditions, may induce oxidative DNA damage that, in turn, may lead to colorectal carcinogenesis as a consequence of the appearance of cell populations resistant to bile acid-induced apoptosis. Finally, some bile acids, such as UDCA, or low concentrations of hydrophobic bile acids, can protect colon cells against apoptosis induced by high concentrations of cytotoxic bile acids, suggesting a dual behavior of these agents as pro-death or pro-survival molecules.
