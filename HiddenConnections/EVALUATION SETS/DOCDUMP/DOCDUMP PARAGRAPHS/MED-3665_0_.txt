Abstract OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of self-experience multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention on health care providers (HCPs), patients and clinics. METHODS: We randomized 15 primary-care clinics (serving 93,821 members), matched by patient profile, to provide the HCPs, either intervention or control HMO program. We followed personally 77 HCPs and 496 patients, and evaluated clinical measurement rate (CMR) changes (January-September 2010; Israel).
