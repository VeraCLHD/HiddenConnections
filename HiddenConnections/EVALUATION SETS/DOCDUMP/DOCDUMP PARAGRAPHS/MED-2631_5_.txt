Serum markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and angiogenesis were performed only in the experimental group. After 12 weeks, FMD had improved in the experimental group from a baseline of 4.23 + or - 0.13 to 4.65 + or - 0.15 mm, whereas in the control group it decreased from 4.62 + or - 0.16 to 4.48 + or - 0.17 mm. Changes were significantly different in favor of the experimental group (p <0.0001).
