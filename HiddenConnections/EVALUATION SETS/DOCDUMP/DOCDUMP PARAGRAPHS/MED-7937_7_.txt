Women in the highest quintile of kaempferol intake relative to those in the lowest had a multivariate relative risk of 0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.48, 0.93; p for trend = 0.04). The lower risk associated with kaempferol intake was probably attributable to broccoli consumption. These prospective data do not support an inverse association between flavonol or flavone intake and CHD risk.
