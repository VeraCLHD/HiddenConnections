Abstract The potential causes of excessive, prolonged crying in early infancy represent a broad range of conditions. The underlying etiology causing an acute episode of crying may not be recognized in a single emergency department encounter. An adverse outcome may result when an infant with unexplained crying is discharged with a diagnosis of colic.
