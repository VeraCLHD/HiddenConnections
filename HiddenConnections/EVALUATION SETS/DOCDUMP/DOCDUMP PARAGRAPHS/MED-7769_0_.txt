Abstract Curcumin has been reported to have the potential to prevent obesity as well as cancers. The downstream targets regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) for inhibiting adipocyte differentiation or cancer cell proliferation of curcumin were investigated. The activation of AMPK by curcumin was crucial for the inhibition of differentiation or growth in both adipocytes and cancer cells.
