OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether body composition and certain dietary intakes are associated with AA production in children after accounting for urinary indicators of major adrenarche-related steroidogenic enzymes. DESIGN: Androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites were profiled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 24-h urine samples of 137 healthy prepubertal children aged 3-12 y, for whom birth characteristics, growth velocity data, and 3-d weighed-diet record information were available. Associations of the sum of C19 metabolites (reflecting daily AA secretion) with nutritional factors [fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), nutrient intakes, glycemic index, and glycemic load] and AA-relevant estimates of steroidogenic enzyme were examined in stepwise multiple regression models adjusted for age, sex, urine volume, and total energy intake.
