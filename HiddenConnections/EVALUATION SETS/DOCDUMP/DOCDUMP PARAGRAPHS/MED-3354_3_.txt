RESULTS: Orange peel extracts had the strongest inhibition of MMP in Caco-2 and LoVo cells, while shaddock had the least. Shaddock peel extracts also had the least MMP inhibition in LoVo/ADR lysates. Grapefruit had the least proteasome inhibition in Caco-2 and LoVo lysates, while there was no significant (p>0.05) difference in the proteasome inhibition of the peel extracts in LoVo/ADR lysates.
