Conclusions Intensive glycemic treatment did not reduce the risk of advanced measures of microvascular outcomes, but delayed the onset of macroalbuminuria and some measures of eye complications and neuropathy. These benefits must be weighed against the increase in total and CVD-related mortality, increased weight gain, and higher risk for severe hypoglycemia.
