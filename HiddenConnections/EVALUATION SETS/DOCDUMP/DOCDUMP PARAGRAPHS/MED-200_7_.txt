The interactions of sMG with diabetes, sex, age, kidney function, and APOE4 genotype were not significant. Conclusions Higher levels of baseline sMG were associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline, after adjusting for several sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. This relationship did not differ by sex, APOE4 genotype, or diabetes status suggesting its generality.
