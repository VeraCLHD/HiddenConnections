Similarly, treatment of lymphocytes with zingerone prior to radiation exposure showed significant decrease in the DNA damage as assessed by comet parameters, such as percent tail DNA and Olive tail moment. Further, treatment with zingerone (10Î¼g/ml) before irradiation significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells analyzed microscopically method and by DNA ladder assay. Similarly, the radiation induced reactive oxygen species levels were significantly (P<0.01) inhibited by zingerone.
