Both in males and females, plant protein intake was inversely associated with BMI (males: β = - 0·036; P < 0·001; females: β = - 0·046; P = 0·001) and WC (male: β = - 0·137; P < 0·001; female: β = - 0·096; P = 0·024). In conclusion, plant protein intakes were lower than animal protein intakes among a representative sample of the Belgian population and decreased with age. Associations with anthropometric data indicated that plant proteins could offer a protective effect in the prevention of overweight and OB in the Belgian population.
