Several of the general characteristics of the unknown compounds were reported after one (referred to as compound 180/442) was found to have a cyclic pattern of excretion during the menstrual cycle of an adult vervet monkey (Fig. 1). An investigation of the nature and distribution of the compounds has shown them to be urinary constituents in humans, baboons, vervet monkeys and rats, and further related compounds have been detected, so far only in vervet monkey urine. We now report spectroscopic and chemical studies that show the two original compounds to be lignans, which have a 2,3-dibenzylbutane skeleton as their basic structure.
