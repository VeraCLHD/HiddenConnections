Abstract Interest in dietary phytochemicals for potential cancer chemoprevention has increased substantially. Screening dietary compounds for chemopreventive activity however, requires a systematic and wide-ranging approach to encompass the complexity of carcinogenesis. We present some of the molecular pathways that underpin the broad biological processes involved in carcinogenesis.
