Prespecified composite outcomes were: 1) dialysis or renal transplantation, or serum creatinine >291.7 micromol/L, or retinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy, and 2) these plus peripheral neuropathy. Thirteen prespecified secondary measures of kidney, eye, and peripheral nerve function were also evaluated. Randomization was performed at clinical sites using a central randomization routine available on the study website.
