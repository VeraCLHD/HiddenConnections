Increasing FR content in the blood is related to increasing CAD severity, while the severity of elevated FR level correlates with how deep into a blood vessel there is activation of the FR scavenger enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD). The ApoE genotype and SP/NFT areal densities were determined in a large population of non-demented CAD, HyperT and non-heart disease (non-HD) control subjects, and compared to findings in a similar number of AD patients. ApoE immunoreactivity was determined in many individuals.
