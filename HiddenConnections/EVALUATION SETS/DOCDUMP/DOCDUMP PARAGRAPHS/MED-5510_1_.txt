This retrospective and observational study was designed to determine if related adverse event reports were significant, and to investigate potential mechanism for their occurrence in this group of subjects, many of whom were concurrently receiving oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Incidence of nausea, vomiting, rash, and total complaints in the 3 months following the change of the multivitamin formulation was compared with the same complaints in the 3 months before the change. In the 3 months following the multivitamin change, there were 166 complaints of nausea and vomiting, 9 complaints of rash and 194 total complaints from a group of 88,468 patients.
