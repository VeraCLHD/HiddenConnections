In hyperglycemic and oxidative conditions, sulforaphane has the potential to activate the NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response-signaling pathway, induces phase 2 enzymes, attenuates oxidative stress, and inactivates nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB), a key modulator of inflammatory pathways. Interestingly, sulforaphane induces some peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, which contribute to lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. In animal and in vitro models, sulforaphane also shows antihypertensive, anticancer, cardioprotective, and hypocholesterolemic capacity, and has bactericidal properties against Helicobacter pylori.
