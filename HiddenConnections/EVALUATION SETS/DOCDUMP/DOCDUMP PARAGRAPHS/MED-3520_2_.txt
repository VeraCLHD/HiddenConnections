The prevalence of hypertension is rising rapidly in Nigeria, from 11% two decades ago to about 30% in recent times.

The evidence behind this strategy is explored, methods of how this goal was achieved in other countries are investigated and recommendations on how it could be accomplished in the Nigerian context are considered.
