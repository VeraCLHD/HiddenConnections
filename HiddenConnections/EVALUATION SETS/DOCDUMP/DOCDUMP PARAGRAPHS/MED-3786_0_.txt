Abstract BACKGROUND: Neutropenia is a potentially serious side effect of chemotherapy and a major risk factor for infections, which can be life-threatening. It has been hypothesised that a low bacterial diet (LBD) can prevent the occurrence of infections and (infection-related) mortality in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia, but much remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of an LBD versus a control diet in preventing the occurrence of infection and to decrease (infection-related) mortality in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia.
