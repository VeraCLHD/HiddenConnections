Abstract BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have implicated cerebrovascular disease and its antecedents as risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD). Cerebral atherosclerosis or strokes may increase the deposition of neuritic plaques or the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Alternatively, they may simply hasten the age at onset of disease, or increase the severity of disease symptoms.
