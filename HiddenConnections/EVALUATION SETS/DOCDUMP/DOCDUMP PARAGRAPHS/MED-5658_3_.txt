There were numerous heterotopic neurons, both isolated and in groups, in the white matter of cerebrum and cerebellum and the laminar cortical pattern of the laminar cortical pattern of the cerebrum was disturbed in many regions as was shown by the irregular groupings and the deranged alignment of cortical. Prominent in the white matter of the cerebrum and the cerebellum was diffuse gemistocytic astrocytosis accompanied by an accumulation of mercury grains in their cytoplasm. These findings indicate a high degree of vulnerability of human fetal brain to maternal intoxication by methylmercury.
