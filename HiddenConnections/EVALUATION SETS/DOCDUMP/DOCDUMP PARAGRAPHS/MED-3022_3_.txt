DATA SOURCES: Databases were searched from the earliest record to April 2008 and supplemented by crosschecking reference lists of relevant publications. STUDY SELECTION: Human adult intervention trials, at least 2 weeks in duration, with an increased and measurable consumption of DF were included and rated for quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven clinical trials were included, and six of these reported significantly lower CRP concentrations of 25-54% with increased DF consumption with dosages ranging between 3.3-7.8 g/MJ.
