RESULTS: The total urinary excretion of ITCs correlated significantly with the two doses of ITC from diets with high or low cruciferous content (r (s )= 0.90, P < 0.01). The fraction of urinary ITC excreted was 69.02 +/- 11.57% and 74.53 +/- 8.39% of the amounts ingested for 80 and 350 g cruciferous vegetables, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results in this study indicate that the urinary excretion of ITCs, measured by use of the cyclocondesation reaction, is a useful and precise tool that may be used as a biomarker of ITC exposure in population based studies.
