Given the constant exposure to these microbes, the intestinal immune system has the difficult task of maintaining tolerance to commensal bacteria while remaining responsive to potential pathogens. The mechanisms by which this balance is achieved are relatively unknown. Here, we identify a bacterial metabolite, n-butyrate, that exerts immunomodulatory effects on intestinal macrophages and renders them hyporesponsive to commensals that reside in the colon.
