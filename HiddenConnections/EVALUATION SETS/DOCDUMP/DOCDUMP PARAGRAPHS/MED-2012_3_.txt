Personal activity patterns were recorded with a diary to investigate non-dietary routes of exposure. All urine void events during the fast were collected, as well as events before and after the fast. The pattern of BPA concentrations was similar for all participants: they rose near the beginning of the fast (after the pre-fast meal), declined over the next 24h, fluctuated at lower levels during the second day, and then rose after the post-fast meal.
