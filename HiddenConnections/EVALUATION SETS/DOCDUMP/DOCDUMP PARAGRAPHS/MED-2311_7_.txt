Secondary analyses suggested a trend towards increased efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in trials of lower methodological quality, trials of shorter duration, trials, which utilized completers rather than intention-to-treat analysis, and trials in which study participants had greater baseline depression severity, Current published trials suggest a small, non-significant benefit of omega-3 fatty acids for major depression. Nearly all of the treatment efficacy observed in the published literature may be attributable to publication bias.
