RESULTS: Following oral ingestion of any of the three fat emulsions over 24 h, plasma NEFAs were elevated by approximately 1.5- to 2-fold over the basal level. Ingestion of any of the three fat emulsions resulted in reduction in insulin clearance, and SFA ingestion reduced insulin sensitivity. PUFA ingestion was associated with an absolute reduction in GSIS, whereas insulin secretion failed to compensate for insulin resistance in subjects who ingested SFA.
