Uptake in USA-fat was typically bilateral and symmetric, intense, more often multifocal than linear, and located in fat on PET/CT. Age was not significantly different for group C versus the 2 other groups. Intensity; mean standardized uptake value, lean (SUV(L MEAN)); or maximum standardized uptake value, lean (SUV(L MAX)), did not allow differentiation between patterns A and C (P > 0.05).
