Flavonoids with three vicinal hydroxyl groups exhibited enhanced inhibitory effects on alpha-synuclein fibrillation. The antioxidant activities of flavonoids were generally correlated with their in vitro inhibitory effects on alpha-synuclein fibrillation. The flavonoids inhibiting alpha-synuclein fibrillation and stabilizing the protein monomeric conformation can serve as a model for the development of therapeutic drugs in combating Parkinson's disease.
