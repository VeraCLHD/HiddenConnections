A 1-mmol/l increase in plasma sodium was associated with a 1.91-mmâ€‰Hg increase in systolic blood pressure by linear regression. Thus, changes in plasma sodium concentration occur each time a meal containing salt is consumed. A potential mechanism for the changes in blood pressure seen with salt intake may be through its effects on plasma sodium concentration.
