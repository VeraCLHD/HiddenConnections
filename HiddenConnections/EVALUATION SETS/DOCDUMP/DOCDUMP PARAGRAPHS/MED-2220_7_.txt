In Ely, 37 incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified among 777 participants. In meta-analysis, the combined RR of type 2 diabetes comparing the highest with lowest quartile of 25(OH)D was 0.59 (0.52, 0.67), with little heterogeneity (I (2)â€‰=2.7%, p=0.42) between the 11 studies included (3,612 cases and 55,713 non-cases). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings demonstrate an inverse association between circulating 25(OH)D and incident type 2 diabetes.
