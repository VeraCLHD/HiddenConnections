High dietary SFA intake was significantly associated with a greater number of periodontal disease events among non-smokers. The multivariate adjusted relative risk (95% confidence intervals) in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles of dietary SFAs was 1.00, 1.19 (0.72-1.97), 1.55 (0.95-2.52), and 1.92 (1.19-3.11), respectively. These findings suggest an independent association of dietary SFA intake to the progression of periodontal disease in older Japanese non-smokers.
