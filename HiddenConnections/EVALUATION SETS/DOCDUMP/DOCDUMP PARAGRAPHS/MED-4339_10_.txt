Results The mean age of the 272 participants was 41.9Â±4.5 years. Serum E1 (85 vs 100 pg/mL, p=0.04) and E2 (140 vs 154 pg/mL, p=0.04) levels were lower in the 37 semi-vegetarians than in the 235 non-vegetarians. The sum of the 9 urinary estrogen metabolites (183 vs 200 pmol/mg creatinine, p=0.27) and the proportions of individual estrogens and pathways did not differ by meat-eating status.
