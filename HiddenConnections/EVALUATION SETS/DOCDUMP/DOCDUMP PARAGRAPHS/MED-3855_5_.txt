Urine, as a morning second-void sample, was collected at each visit for urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen. RESULTS: Our results show that oral curcumin is able to decrease paraprotein load in a select group (i.e., those having a paraprotein level of >20 g/L) of patients with MGUS. Fifty percent (5 of 10) of these patients had a 12% to 30% reduction in their paraprotein levels, while on curcumin therapy.
