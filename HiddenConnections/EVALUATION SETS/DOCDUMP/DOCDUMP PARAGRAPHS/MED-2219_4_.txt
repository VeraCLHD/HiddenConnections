Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers collected data and assessed trial quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Random-effects models were used to estimate mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios. The main outcomes of interest were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homeostasis model assessment of Î²-cell function, hemoglobin A1c levels, fasting blood glucose, incident diabetes, and adverse events.
