RESULTS: There were no significant differences in HADS depression or SPHERE scores between the randomly assigned groups. However, HADS anxiety scores were significantly lower at treatment completion in the carrier oil only group compared with either of the fragrant arms (P =.04). CONCLUSION: Aromatherapy, as administered in this study, is not beneficial.
