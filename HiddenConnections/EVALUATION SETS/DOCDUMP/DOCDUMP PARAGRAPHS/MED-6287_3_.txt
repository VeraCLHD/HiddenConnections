Fisetin also caused cell cycle arrest at G(1) (strong) and G(2)/M (moderate) phases together with a decrease in cyclin D1 and an increase in p53 levels. Fisetin-caused cell death was accompanied by decreased expression of survivin and an increase in cleaved levels of caspases-3 and -7 and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase along with an increased ratio of Bax to Bcl-2. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel (up to 85%, P < 0.001) as well as migration (up to 66%, P < 0.001), which were associated with decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and VEGF in HUVEC.
