We are presenting a 63-year-old male reported in emergency with painful abdomen and diagnosed as having peritonitis. On laparotomy, we incidentally found giant and multiple jejunal diverticula along with ileal perforation. Nothing was done to the jejunal diverticula, as these were multiple and non-obstructive.
