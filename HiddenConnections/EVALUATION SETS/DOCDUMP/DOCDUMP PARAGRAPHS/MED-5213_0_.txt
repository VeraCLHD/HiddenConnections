Abstract BACKGROUND: In recent decades, children's diet quality has changed and asthma prevalence has increased, although it remains unclear if these events are associated. OBJECTIVE: To examine children's total and component diet quality and asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a proxy for asthma severity. METHODS: Food frequency questionnaires adapted from the Nurses' Health Study and supplemented with foods whose nutrients which have garnered interest of late in relation to asthma were administered.
