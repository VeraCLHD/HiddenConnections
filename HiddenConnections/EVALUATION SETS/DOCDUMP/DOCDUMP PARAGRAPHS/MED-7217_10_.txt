Surprisingly, consumption of eight cups of green tea per day (4 g) significantly increased NDMA excretion during days 4-7 (p=0.0001), again not during days 1-3. This increase is probably a result of catalytic effects of tea polyphenols on nitrosation, or of another, yet unknown, mechanism. These results suggest that intake of ascorbic acid and moderate consumption of green tea can reduce endogenous NDMA formation.
