A 3 d weighed food record was used to assess the diet composition during HT and LT diet intake. Significant increases in the intake of TAC, vitamins E and C and phenolic compounds were observed during the HT diet intake. The higher intake of antioxidants led to increased 48 h stool output (324 (SD 38) g in HT v. 218 (SD 22) g in LT), and to higher TAC and total phenolic concentrations in faecal water.
