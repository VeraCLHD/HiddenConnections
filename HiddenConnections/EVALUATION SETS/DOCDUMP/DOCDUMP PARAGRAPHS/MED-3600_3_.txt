Most evidence accumulated so far implicates HHcy as a risk factor for AD onset, but conflicting results also exist. In this review, we summarize reports on the relationship between HHCy and AD from epidemiological investigations, including observational studies and randomized controlled clinical trials. We also examine recent in vivo and in vitro studies of potential mechanisms whereby HHcy may influence AD development.
