Abstract The ability of sorbic acid and its potassium and sodium salts to induce chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and gene mutations in cultured Chinese hamster V79 cells was examined. Sodium sorbate caused significant induction of chromosome aberrations and SCE, and also induced 6-thioguanine-resistant mutations in a dose-dependent manner. The clastogenic potency of sodium sorbate was found to be less than one hundredth of that of the potent clastogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine.
