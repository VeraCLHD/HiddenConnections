Abstract Restriction of food intake by 10-50% of ad libitum on a per unit of weight or energy content basis can extend the lifespan of a wide variety of species and prevent or delay age-related disease. This review first briefly summarizes the data delineating mortality trajectories of various species' populations maintained on restricted diets to provide insight into the effects of nutrient deprivation on distinct components of the aging process. Next, I discuss a number of important studies that have addressed the question whether it is the lack of calories and/or specific nutrients that determines the longevity response to dietary restriction.
