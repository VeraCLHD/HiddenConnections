Abstract OBJECTIVE: To report experience with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in 108 severely obese children and adolescents. BACKGROUND: Obesity during childhood and adolescence can be accompanied by serious long-term adverse health and longevity outcomes. With increased use of bariatric surgery to treat obesity in these patients, diverse guidelines have been published, most of which exclude children aged younger than 14 years.
