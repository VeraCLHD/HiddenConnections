Filtered lipoprotein accumulates in mesangial cells and stimulates them to proliferate and produce excess basement membrane material. The proximal tubular cells metabolise some of the filtered lipoprotein and the remainder are altered on passage down the nephron. Luminal apoprotein precipitates, initiating or aggravating tubulo-interstitial disease, if the intraluminal pH is close to the isoelectric point of the apoprotein.
