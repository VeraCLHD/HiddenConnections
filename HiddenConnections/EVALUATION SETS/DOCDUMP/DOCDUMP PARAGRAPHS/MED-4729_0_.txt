Abstract Enterobacterial strains producing clavulanic-acid-inhibited extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs) are increasingly reported worldwide. Conventional detection of ESBL production remains time-consuming (24 to 48 h). Therefore, the ESBL NDP (Nordmann/Dortet/Poirel) test was developed for a rapid identification of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae.
