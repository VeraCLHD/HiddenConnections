15 patients with CRF (51Cr-EDTA-measured glomerular filtration rate 15-50 ml/min/1.73 m2) were studied. In a randomized crossover trial, the patients were given each diet (each containing 0.75 g protein and 32 kcal per kilogram body weight) for a 6-month period. Nine patients completed the trial, 2 others dropped out because they could not tolerate the VPD, 3 because of unrelated medical complications, and 1 for technical reasons.
