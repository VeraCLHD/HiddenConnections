Abstract In this study, 10 perfluorochemicals (PFCs) were measured in meat, meat products, and eggs, and in indoor dust, collected in China. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were the most frequently detected PFCs in these samples. Mean concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in foodstuffs were in the range of 0.05-1.99 ng/g fresh wt and 0.06-12.5 ng/g fresh wt, respectively.
