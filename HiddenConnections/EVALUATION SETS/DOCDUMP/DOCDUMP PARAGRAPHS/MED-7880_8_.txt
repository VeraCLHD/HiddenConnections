As Rogan et al. stated, "For certain fat-soluble chemicals, nursing infants can be regarded as living at the top of the food chain and are exposed to much more than background levels." Nursing infants of vegetarian women whose diets are low on the food chain are exposed to less chemical pollution. These preliminary results indicate that diet may indeed be a major predictor of chemical pollutants in the body.
