RESULTS: Of the 192 (7.0%) questionnaires with a 'Yes' response (report of a food allergy), 182 were retained as reporting true food allergies (6.7%). The cumulative and point prevalences were 6.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8-7.6] and 4.7% [95% CI 3.9-5.5], respectively. The point prevalences were 4.0% for the children aged 2-5 years, 6.8% for the children aged 6-10 years, and 3.4% for the children aged 11-14 years.
