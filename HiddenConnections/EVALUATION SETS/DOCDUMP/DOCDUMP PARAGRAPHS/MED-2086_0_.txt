Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is unclear if a modest reduction in dietary salt intake has beneficial effects on vascular function. The aim was to compare the effects of 9 g salt/day with 6 g salt/day intake on measures of vascular function and explore mechanisms of effect in overweight and obese adults. METHODS: Twenty-five overweight/obese subjects (BMI 27-40 kg/m(2)) completed a randomised cross-over study of 6 weeks each on a reduced salt (RS) (6 g/day) and usual salt diet (US) (9 g/day).
