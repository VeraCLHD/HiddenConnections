Four HAA MeIQx (0.3-0.6 ng/g), PhIP (0.02-0.06 ng/g), co-mutagenic norharmane (0.4-0.7 ng/g), and harmane (0.8-1.1 ng/g) were found at low levels. The concentration of MeIQx was reduced by about 50% and 40% by applying marinades containing the highest amount of extract compared to sunflower oil and control marinade, respectively. The antioxidant capacity (TEAC-Assay/Folin-Ciocalteu-Assay) was determined as 0.9, 1.7, 2.6 and 3.5 micromol Trolox antioxidant equivalents and total phenolic compounds were 49, 97, 146 and 195 microg/g marinade.
