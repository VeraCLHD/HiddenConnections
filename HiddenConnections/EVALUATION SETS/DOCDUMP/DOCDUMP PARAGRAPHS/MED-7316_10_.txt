Although there was some temporal improvement in the rate of LLT from 2005 to 2007, a decline in use of LLT was noted in 2008 and 2009. This was attributed to a sharp reduction in use of ezetimibe in combination with statin, without corresponding increases in intensive statin monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients admitted with ACS, most of the eligible patients were not discharged on LLT.
