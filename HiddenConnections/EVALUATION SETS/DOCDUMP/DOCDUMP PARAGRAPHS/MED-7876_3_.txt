Regarding the recommendation, two scenarios were developed differing in LC n-3 PUFAs intake: a 0.3 E% and a 0.46 E% scenario. Total exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like substances in the 0.3 E% LC n-3 PUFAs scenario ranges from 2.31 pg TEQ/kg bw/day at the 5th percentile, over 4.37 pg TEQ/kgbw/day at the 50th percentile to 8.41 pg TEQ/kgbw/day at the 95th percentile. In the 0.46 E% LC n-3 PUFAs scenario, 5, 50 and 95th percentile are exposed to 2.74, 5.52 and 9.98 pg TEQ/kgbw/day, respectively.
