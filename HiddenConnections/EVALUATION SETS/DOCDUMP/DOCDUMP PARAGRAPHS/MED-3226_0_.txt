Abstract The Abeta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), the main component of amyloid plaques, is derived by proteolytic cleavage from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Epidemiologic and biochemical data suggest a link between cholesterol, APP processing, Abeta, and Alzheimer's disease. Two recent epidemiologic studies indicate that there is a decreased prevalence of AD associated with the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins).
