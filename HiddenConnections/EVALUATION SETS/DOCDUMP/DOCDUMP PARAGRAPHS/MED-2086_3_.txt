Flow-mediated-dilatation (FMD), 24 h blood pressure (BP), augmentation index (AIx), pulse wave velocity (PWV), plasma and urinary nitrate/nitrite, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 and vascular adhesion molecules were measured after 2 days and 6 weeks. Adherence to the diets was determined from two 24 h urine collections. RESULTS: Urinary sodium excretion was 155 ± 58 mmol/24 h US vs 113 ± 45 mmol/24 h RS (p = 0.002).
