Median %CD16+ cells was 17% (range 7%-33%) in trained vs 11% (3%-29%) in untrained (P = 0.007). Indomethacin in vitro enhanced the NK cell activity in both groups. There was, however, no significant difference between the NK cell activity in trained and untrained after exposure to indomethacin in vitro.
