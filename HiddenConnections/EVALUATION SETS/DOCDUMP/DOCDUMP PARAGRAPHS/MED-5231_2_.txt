We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on school children (age, 6-12 years) with asthma and AR. The eligible study subjects received either L. gasseri A5 (n = 49) or a placebo (n = 56) daily for 2 months. Pulmonary function tests were performed, and the clinical severity of asthma and AR was evaluated by the attending physicians in the study period.
