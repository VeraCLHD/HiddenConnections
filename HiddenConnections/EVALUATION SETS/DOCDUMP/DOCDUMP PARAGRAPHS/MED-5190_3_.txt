Disease activity, extent of disease, sleep and itch, topical steroid use, and adverse events were assessed every two weeks. Both extent and activity of dermatitis were significantly improved (p less than 0.001) as were subjective measures of disease. 20 patients receiving cyclosporin reported adverse events compared with 8 taking placebo, although no patient required withdrawal from the study.
