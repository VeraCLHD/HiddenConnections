RECENT FINDINGS: Groups of patients with acute diarrhea or dysentery (passage of grossly bloody stools) are being followed for development of PI-IBS. Persistent mucosal inflammation, air trapping in the gut, and alteration of intestinal motility contribute to the disease symptoms in genetically susceptible persons. The prognosis of postinfectious forms of IBS is more favorable compared with people with idiopathic forms of the disorder.
