RESULTS: Information was provided by 511 (86%) of the 591 men. A large majority of the men participating in this study ended up in one of two extreme categories: either they accepted the therapy-induced symptom to gain survival or they did not. For fecal leakage, 78% of the men chose one of two extreme categories compared with 74% for urinary leakage, 71% for tender enlarged breasts, 73% for erectile dysfunction, and 78% for restricted diet.
