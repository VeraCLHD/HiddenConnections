Abstract Diabetes is increasing rapidly worldwide and frequently results in severe vascular complications. A target glycated hemoglobin of less than 7% has commonly been recommended in hopes of preventing both macrovascular and microvascular complications. Although results from trials of intensive glycemic control have generally supported the notion that lower glycated hemoglobin values reduce microvascular disease, the evidence for similar benefits for macrovascular disease has been less clear.
