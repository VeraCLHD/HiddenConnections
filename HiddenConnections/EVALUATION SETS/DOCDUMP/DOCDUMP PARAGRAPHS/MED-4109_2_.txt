Dietary habits were assessed with validated FFQ at baseline and repeatedly every year during 4 years of follow-up. Using multivariate models to adjust for covariates, long-term weight and waist circumference changes according to quartiles of change in energy-adjusted white and whole-grain bread consumption were calculated. The present results showed that over 4 years, participants in the highest quartile of change in white bread intake gained 0路76 kg more than those in the lowest quartile (P for trend = 0路003) and 1路28 cm more than those in the lowest quartile (P for trend < 0路001).
