Abstract The consequences of a change from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet for 12 mo on trace element concentrations in plasma, hair, urine, and feces were studied in 16 women and 4 men. After the diet shift, intakes of zinc and magnesium did not change but that of selenium decreased by 40%. Three months after the diet shift, plasma and hair concentrations of zinc, copper, and selenium had decreased but those of magnesium had increased and the concentrations of mercury, lead, and cadmium in hair were lower.
