OBJECTIVES The analysis was designed to investigate the potential endocrine disruption of PBDEs on the age at menarche in adolescent girls. METHODS We analyzed the data from a sample of 271 adolescent girls (age 12–19 years) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003–2004. We estimated the associations between individual and total serum BDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, and -154, lipid adjusted) and mean age at menarche.
