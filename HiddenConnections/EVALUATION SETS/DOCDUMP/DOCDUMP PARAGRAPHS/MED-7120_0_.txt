Abstract OBJECTIVE: To determine possible exposure-associated delays in auditory brainstem evoked potential latencies as an objective measure of neurobehavioral toxicity in 14-year-old children with developmental exposure to methylmercury (MeHg) from seafood. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of a birth cohort in the Faroe Islands, where 878 of eligible children (87%) were examined at age 14 years. Latencies of brainstem evoked potential peaks I, III, and V at 20 and 40 Hz constituted the outcome variables.
