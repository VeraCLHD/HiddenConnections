Food boluses obtained just before swallowing were analyzed in ten subjects (aged 36.7 +/- 9.5 yrs) with normal dentition. Food samples of 3 nuts (peanut, almond, pistachio) and 3 vegetables (cauliflower, radish, and carrot) were chewed and expectorated after self-estimated complete mastication. Measurements with sieving and laser diffraction methods indicated that particles were much larger in vegetables than in nuts.
