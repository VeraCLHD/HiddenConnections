We have compared the effect of a soya-based vegetarian low-protein diet (VPD) and an animal-based low-protein diet (APD) in 15 patients with CRF. 15 patients with CRF (51Cr-EDTA-measured glomerular filtration rate 15-50 ml/min/1.73 m2) were studied. In a randomized crossover trial, the patients were given each diet (each containing 0.75 g protein and 32 kcal per kilogram body weight) for a 6-month period.
