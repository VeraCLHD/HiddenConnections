Abstract CONTEXT: Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] may affect the prognosis of cancer patients; however, the epidemiological results are not consistent. OBJECTIVE: To perform a meta-analysis of all published studies to assess the associations of circulating 25(OH)D levels measured at or near the time of diagnosis and outcomes for cancer patients. DATA SOURCES: Searches of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases were performed and updated to December 2013.
