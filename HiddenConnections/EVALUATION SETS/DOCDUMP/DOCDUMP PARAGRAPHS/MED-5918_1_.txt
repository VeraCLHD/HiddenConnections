The present study was undertaken to determine whether neurocysticercosis is more common among patients with primary headaches than in other neurological disorders. METHODS: We determined the prevalence of neurocysticercosis in a cohort of patients with primary headache who were seen at our institution over a 20-year period. We used as controls all people from the same cohort with four major different categories of neurological disorders, including cerebrovascular disease, degenerative disorders of the CNS, head trauma, and primary brain tumors.
