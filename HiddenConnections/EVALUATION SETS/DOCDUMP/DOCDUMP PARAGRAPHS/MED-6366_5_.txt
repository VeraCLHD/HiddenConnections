Infertile smoker and nonsmoker patients showed similar sperm parameters, although sperm motility and TEM analysis values in both groups were significantly impaired compared with controls. Smoker patients were then classified as mild (>or=1 and <or=10 cigarettes/d), moderate (>10 and <20 cigarettes/day), or heavy smokers (>or=20 cigarettes/d). Sperm concentration and FI were significantly (P < .05) different among the 3 considered smoker classes.
