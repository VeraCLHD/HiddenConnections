There was a significant negative linear relationship between Cd concentration in kidney and kidney weight. There was no significant difference in liver Cd levels between organic and conventional pigs and the mean +/- SD was 15.4 +/- 3.0. In spite of the lower level of Cd in the organic feed, the organic pigs had significantly higher levels in kidneys than the conventional pigs, 96.1 +/- 19.5 microg/kg wet weight (mean +/- SD; n = 37) and 84.0 +/- 17.6 microg/kg wet weight (n = 40), respectively.
