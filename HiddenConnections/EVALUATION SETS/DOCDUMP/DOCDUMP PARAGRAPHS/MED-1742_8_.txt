Passive smoking and the inhalation of ambient air are relatively in important for total pyrene intake (both account for less than 1%). Neither the consumption of alcohol nor the inhalation of ambient air significantly affected urinary 1-hydroxypyrene excretion. It is concluded that when urinary 1-OH-pyrene excretion is used in the assessment of PAH exposure, one should particularly be aware of the interindividual variability of the baseline excretion of PAH metabolites due to tobacco smoking and dietary PAH intake.
