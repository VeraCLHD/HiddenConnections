Body weights were self-reported at baseline and updated biennially thereafter for 10 years. RESULTS On average, the women gained 2.09 kg (95% confidence interval (CI), − 2.27 to 6.80 kg) during the 10-year follow-up. In multivariate analysis with adjustment of lifestyle and dietary factors, in comparison with women in the lowest quartile of BPA concentration, those in the highest quartile had 0.23 kg per year (95% CI, 0.07–0.38 kg per year) greater weight gain during the 10-year follow-up (P-trend = 0.02).
