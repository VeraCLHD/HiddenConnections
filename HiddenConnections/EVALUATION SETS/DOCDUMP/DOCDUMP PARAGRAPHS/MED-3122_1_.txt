We extended our previous searches on MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 1997 and examined citations from relevant articles. We contacted the authors of eligible trials to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data, and to identify unpublished trials. We included any study in which investigators randomized hypertensive or normotensive people to calcium supplementation or alternative therapy and measured blood pressure for at least 2 weeks.
