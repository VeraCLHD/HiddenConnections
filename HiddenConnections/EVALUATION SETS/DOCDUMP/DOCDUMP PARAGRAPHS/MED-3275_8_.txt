The authors did find a higher frequency of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with increased amyloid angiopathy. Neither plaques nor tangles were associated with small vessel cerebrovascular disease, arteriosclerosis. However, the presence of large-vessel cerebrovascular disease, or atherosclerosis, was strongly associated with an increased frequency of neuritic plaques.
