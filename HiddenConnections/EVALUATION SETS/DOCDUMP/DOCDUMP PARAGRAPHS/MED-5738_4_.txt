Urinary levels of phytate were linked to dietary phytate consumption. Hence, bone mineral density values were significantly higher in the lumbar spines and femoral necks of women who consumed high levels of phytate than in women with low urinary phytate concentrations. Higher urinary levels of phytate correlated with higher bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and femoral necks of postmenopausal women.
