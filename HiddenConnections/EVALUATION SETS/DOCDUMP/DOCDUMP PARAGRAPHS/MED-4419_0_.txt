Abstract The effect of different classes of dietary polyphenols on intestinal glucose uptake was investigated using polarised Caco-2 intestinal cells. Glucose uptake into cells under sodium-dependent conditions was inhibited by flavonoid glycosides and non-glycosylated polyphenols whereas aglycones and phenolic acids were without effect. Under sodium-free conditions, aglycones and non-glycosylated polyphenols inhibited glucose uptake whereas glycosides and phenolic acids were ineffective.
