RESULTS: The overall mortality of aborigines in these townships was approximately 70% higher than the respective male and female general populations over the past 30 years. Mortality from infectious disease, cirrhosis of the liver, accidents, and suicide are substantially higher than the general population. The gap in life expectancy at birth in males was 8.5 years during 1971-1973, increasing to 13.5 years by 1998-2000, however, the gap in females remained relatively stable (8.0 years and 8.4 years, respectively).
