RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment in proportional hazards regression, women who consumed on average 1.9 g refined grain fiber/2,000 kcal and 4.7 g whole grain fiber/2,000 kcal had a 17% lower mortality rate (RR=0.83, 95% CI=0.73-0.94) than women who consumed predominantly refined grain fiber: 4.5 g/2,000 kcal, but only 1.3 g whole grain fiber/2,000 kcal. CONCLUSION: Inferences from studies that have reported associations between grain fiber intake and morbidity or mortality may be limited by not differentiating fiber sources. Future studies should distinguish fiber from whole vs. refined grains.
