We have previously found that binding of anti-Gal to alpha-galactosyl epitopes on porcine thyrocytes results in stimulatory effects similar to those exerted by thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that anti-Gal may contribute to Graves' disease (GD) pathogenesis by stimulation of the thyrocytes of patients with this autoimmune disorder. Anti-Gal binding and stimulatory effects were assessed in primary thyrocyte cultures.
