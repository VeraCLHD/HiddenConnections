The method requires repeated, vigorous agitation of a suspension of faecal solids with detergent, the use of a stomacher, and high-speed centrifugation. By this means the faecal microflora are separated from faecal dietary-fibre residues. These two components, with water-soluble material in the stool, comprise 98.3 +/- 0.9% of faecal solids.
