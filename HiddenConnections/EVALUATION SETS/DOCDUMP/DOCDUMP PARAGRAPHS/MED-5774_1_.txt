High levels of mercury were detected in various regions of the brain at autopsy. Study of the brains revealed a disturbance in the development in both cases, consisting essentially of an incomplete or abnormal migration of neurons to the cerebellar and cerebral cortices, and deranged cortical organization of the cerebrum. There were numerous heterotopic neurons, both isolated and in groups, in the white matter of cerebrum and cerebellum and the laminar cortical pattern of the laminar cortical pattern of the cerebrum was disturbed in many regions as was shown by the irregular groupings and the deranged alignment of cortical.
