The extracts inhibited proteasome activity in extract-treated cells, and HPLC fingerprinting of the extracts revealed the presence of some phenolic compounds such as quercetin, caffeic acid, kaempferol, catechin and naringin. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of MMP and proteasome activities in colon cancer cell lines suggests the potential use of citrus peels as functional food in the management and/or prevention of colon cancer.
