On successive days, patients ingested one of the meals twice, followed by random assignment to 3 h upright and 3 h recumbent position. Acid exposure for each hour over a 3-h postprandial (PP) period was assessed as the percent time pH less than 4.0. Increased upright acid exposure occurred in normals after the high fat (6.2 +/- 2.1%; mean +/- SE) compared with the low fat meal (1.5 +/- 0.5%; p less than 0.05).
