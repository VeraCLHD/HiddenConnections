Consumption of the spinach-supplemented meal did not affect plasma levels of beta-carotene, although the beta-carotene content was 10-fold those of broccoli and green peas, which induced significant increases in plasma beta-carotene levels (28 (95% CI 6.4, 55)% and 26 (95% CI 2.6, 54)% respectively). The beta-carotene-supplemented meal increased plasma concentrations of beta-carotene effectively (517 (95% CI 409, 648)%). All vegetable meals increased the plasma concentrations of lutein and vitamin C significantly.
