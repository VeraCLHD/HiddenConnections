Kiwifruit was taken as an example of a food with putative antioxidant properties, and its effectiveness at decreasing oxidative DNA damage was assessed in ex vivo as well as in vitro tests. The comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) was used to measure DNA damage in lymphocytes collected during a human supplementation trial with a single 0.5-liter drink of kiwifruit juice (with water as a control). The comet assay was also modified to assess the antioxidant effect of kiwifruit in vitro by measuring the ability of an extract to interfere with oxidative damage to DNA induced by H2O2.
