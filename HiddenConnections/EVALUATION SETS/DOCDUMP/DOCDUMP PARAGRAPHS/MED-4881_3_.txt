The regulation and cellular functions of mTORC1 have been the subjects of intense study; despite this, many questions remain to be answered. They include questions about the actual mechanisms by which mTORC1 signaling is stimulated by hormones and growth factors, which involves the small GTPase Rheb, and by amino acids, which involves other GTPase proteins. The control of Rheb and the mechanism by which it activates mTORC1 remain incompletely understood.
