As neurons receive only small amounts of exogenous cholesterol, statins that efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier may reduce the amount of neuronal cholesterol below a critical level. Decreased neuronal cholesterol levels inhibit the Abeta-forming amyloidogenic pathway possibly by removing APP from cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains. In addition, depletion of cellular cholesterol levels reduces the ability of Abeta to act as a seed for further fibril formation.
