The population sample consisted of both sexes and 3 age groups: group 1 (30 years of age), group 2 (40 and 45 years of age), and group 3 (59-60 years of age). In both sexes, HDL decreased and TG increased significantly (p < 0.001) with increasing intake frequency of colas. In contrast, no consistent associations were found between the reported intake of non-cola soft drinks and the serum lipids.
