METHODS: Four male research assistants, posing as asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals, inquired of employees of all retail health food stores in a major Canadian city as to what is recommended for their condition. The research assistants asked about product costs, side effects, potential drug interactions and efficacy. They also inquired as to employee education related to Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and noted whether employees asked about which conventional medications they were taking and whether they recommended that the subjects seek physician or CAM provider advice.
