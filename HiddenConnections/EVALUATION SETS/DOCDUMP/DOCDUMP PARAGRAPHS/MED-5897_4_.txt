After statistically controlling for differences in relative amounts of carbohydrate and fat in the diet and for norepinephrine concentrations, no significant differences in adjusted RMR between vegetarians and nonvegetarians were noted. These results suggest that the higher RMR observed in young male vegetarians is partially mediated by differences in dietary macronutrient composition and increased sympathetic nervous system activity.
