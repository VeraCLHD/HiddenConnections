Abstract Objective To assess the association between animal exposures and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Methods Exposure data were collected from 1,591 cases and 2,515 controls during in-person interviews in a population-based case-control study of NHL in the San Francisco Bay Area. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for potential confounders.
