Serum glucose and insulin area under the curve (180 minutes) increased slightly, but this was significant only with CGJ. Plasma antioxidant capacity did not differ across groups, suggesting no effect of chronic CGJ ingestion on antioxidant status. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of CGJ for 12 weeks did not lead to significant weight gain, but consumption of SGD did.
