Results Compared with daily intake of < 150 mg, the pooled multivariable RRs were 1.05 [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.89–1.25] for consuming 150–299 mg, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.99–1.43] for 300 – 449 mg/day, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.89–1.43] for 450–559 mg and 1.17 [95% CI, 0.90, 1.53] for 600+ mg+ [p for trend = 0.11]. However, for consuming 5+ cups of caffeinated coffee daily, RR was 1.61 [95% CI, 1.00, 2.59; p for trend=0.02]; tea or caffeinated cola intake were not associated with risk. Greater caffeine intake was more adversely associated with POAG among those reporting family history of glaucoma, particularly in relation to POAG with elevated IOP (p for trend =0.0009; p-interaction=0.04).
