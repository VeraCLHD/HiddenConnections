Abstract CONTEXT: Public health authorities around the world recommend widely variable supplementation strategies for adults, whereas several professional organizations, including The Endocrine Society, recommend higher supplementation. METHODS: We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health. CONCLUSIONS: The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies.
