Mean values were 5.7 log CFU/g for total aerobic mesophiles, 6.3 log CFU/g for psychrotrophs, and 1.9 log most probable number (MPN) per gram for coliforms. Differences in these microbial levels between the two kinds of markets and among the four types of fish were not significant (P > 0.05), except that Internet trout fillets had about 0.8-log higher aerobic mesophiles than did trout fillets purchased locally. Although Escherichia coli was detected in 1.4, 1.5, and 5.9% of trout, salmon, and tilapia, respectively, no sample had > or = 1.0 log MPN/g.
