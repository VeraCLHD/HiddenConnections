Strawberry extract concentration-dependently (0.1-1 mg/ml) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP and arachidonic acid. At the same concentrations as strawberry inhibits platelet aggregation, it significantly decreased sP-selectin, sCD40L, RANTES, and IL-1β levels. The strawberry may exert significant protective effects on thromboembolic-related disorders by inhibiting platelet aggregation.
