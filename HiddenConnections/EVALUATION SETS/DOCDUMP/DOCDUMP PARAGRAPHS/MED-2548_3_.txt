The aim of this review is to examine the unique properties of a PBT, like Pb, as well as the analytic methods of detecting and characterizing PBTs. This review offers sections that explore Pb's persistence in the environment, bioaccumulation in fish and birds, and toxic characteristics in the human body. It further examines how Pb's effects on transcription factors could explain the observed Pb lines in Pb-poisoned individuals.
