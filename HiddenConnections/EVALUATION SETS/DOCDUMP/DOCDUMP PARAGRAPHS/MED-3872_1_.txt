In this review, we present data from cellular autoimmune responses, focusing on the interactions between HLA class II molecules, streptococcal peptides and heart tissue proteins and T-cell receptor (TCR) usage. HLA-DR7DR53 associated with DQ molecules seem to be related with the development of valvular lesions in severe RHD patients. DR7DR53 molecules were also involved in the recognition of an immunodominant M5 peptide in these patients.
