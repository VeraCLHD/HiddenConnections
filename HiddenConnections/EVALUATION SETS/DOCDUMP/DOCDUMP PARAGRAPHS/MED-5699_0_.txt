Abstract The hypothesis that plasma chylomicrons in persons who ingest a cholesterol-rich diet are atherogenic is evaluated. Evidence is presented that in humans, and experimental animals, chylomicron remnants as well as low-density lipoproteins are taken up by arterial cells. In persons who do not have familial hyperlipoproteinemia, atherogenesis may occur during the postprandial period.
