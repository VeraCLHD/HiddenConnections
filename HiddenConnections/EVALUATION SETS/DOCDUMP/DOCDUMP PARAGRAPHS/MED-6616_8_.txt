Compared with a more recent period, 2006--2008, incidence in 2010 was lower for STEC O157 and Shigella infection but higher for Vibrio infection. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of STEC O157 infection has declined to reach the 2010 national health objective target of â‰¥1 case per 100,000. This success, as well as marked declines since 1996-1998 in overall incidence of six key foodborne infections, demonstrates the feasibility of preventing foodborne illnesses.
