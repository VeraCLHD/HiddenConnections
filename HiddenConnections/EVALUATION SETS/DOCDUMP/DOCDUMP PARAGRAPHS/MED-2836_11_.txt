These include aspirin-like drugs, which inhibit cyclo-oxygenase. Corticosteroids appear to indirectly inhibit phospholipases thus preventing release of arachidonic acid. Future progress in this field is likely to produce drugs which antagonise arachidonic acid derivatives or inhibit the enzymes involved in their synthesis with greater specificity.
