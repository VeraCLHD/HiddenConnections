Isovaleric and propionic acids, in particular, proved to be effective inducers of both hyperacetylation and apoptosis at 5 mM concentrations, a finding of potential relevance to the unusual pancytopenia occurring after acidotic episodes in isovaleric and propionic acidemias. The duration of butyrate treatment required for chromatin fragmentation (10-20 hr) corresponded to the time required for histone H4 to become predominantly tetraacetylated. Furthermore, trichostatin A, a structurally dissimilar inhibitor of histone deacetylase, mimicked butyrate-induced apoptosis of VACO 5 cells and growth inhibition of HCT 116 cells.
