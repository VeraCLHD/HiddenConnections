Catechin derivatives, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, (−)-epigallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate,and (−)-epicatechin, are the most studied compounds in this topic so far; genistein/genistin, silibinin, quercetin, and anthocyanin have also been widely investigated for their inhibitory activities on invasion/metastasis. Other flavonoids in dietary vegetable foods that are responsible for anti-invasive and anti-metastatic activities of tumors include luteolin,apigenin, myricetin, tangeretin, kaempferol, glycitein, licoricidin,daidzein, and naringenin. To effectively overcome the metastatic cascade, including cell-cell attachment, tissue barrier degradation, migration, invasion, cell-matrix adhesion,and angiogenesis, it is essential that a bioactive compound prevent tumor cells from metastasizing.
