Finally, the ratio of testosterone to estradiol was positively associated with MEHP (p-value=0.07) and MEHP% (p-value=0.007), suggesting potential relationships with aromatase suppression. In conclusion, these results suggest that urinary metabolites of DEHP are inversely associated with circulating steroid hormone levels in adult men. However, additional research is needed to confirm these findings.
