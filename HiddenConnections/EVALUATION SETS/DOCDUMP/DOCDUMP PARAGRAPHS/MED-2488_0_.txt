Abstract AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is activated when the cellular (AMP+ADP)/ATP ratio rises; it therefore serves as a detector of cellular “fuel deficiency.” AMPK activation is suspected to mediate some of the health-protective effects of long-term calorie restriction. Several drugs and nutraceuticals which slightly and safely impede the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP generation—most notably metformin and berberine—can be employed as clinical AMPK activators and, hence, may have potential as calorie restriction mimetics for extending healthspan.
