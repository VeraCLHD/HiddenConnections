Abstract Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is a classic failure of the immune system with a life-threatening attack upon a critical self-component. The active phase of the disease is short, concordant with the latency of a primary adaptive immune response. Triggers for GBS include infection and (rarely) vaccination; cross-reactivity between infectious and neural epitopes has been well demonstrated, particularly for Campylobacter jejuni and motor axonal forms of GBS in which non-protein gangliosides are antigenic.
