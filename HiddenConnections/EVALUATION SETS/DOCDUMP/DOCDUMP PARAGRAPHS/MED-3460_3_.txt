The keywords "coffee," "caffeine," "drink," and "beverage" were used as the exposure factors, and the keyword "fracture" was used as the outcome factor. We determined the overall relative risk (RR) and confidence interval (CI) for the highest and lowest levels of coffee consumption. A dose-response analysis was performed to assess the risk of fractures based on the level of coffee consumption.
