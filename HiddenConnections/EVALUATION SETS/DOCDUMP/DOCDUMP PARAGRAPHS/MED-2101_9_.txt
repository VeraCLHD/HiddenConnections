Diminished osteoblastic activity in post-menopausal osteoporosis was indicated by depressed alkaline phosphatase (P<0.001). Increased serum calcium (P<0.001) and decreased serum phosphorous (P<0.001) in renal osteodystrophy indicated compensatory hyperparathyroidism. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that ROS have a major role to play in bone metabolism.
