Commonly used drugs, such as certain antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, psychotherapeutic agents, and even herbal medicines, may act as photosensitizers that promote retinal UV damage, if they are excited by UVA or visible light and have sufficient retinal penetration. CONCLUSIONS: Although the anterior portion of the eye is the most susceptible to UV damage, the retina is at risk to the longer UV wavelengths that propagate through the ocular media. Some phototoxicity may be counteracted or reduced by dietary intake of antioxidants and protective phytonutrients.
