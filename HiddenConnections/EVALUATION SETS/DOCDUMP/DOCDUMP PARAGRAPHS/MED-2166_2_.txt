Thus, institutionalized older adults are at risk for chronic light deprivation. Testing the hypothesis that chronic light deprivation might be responsible, at least in part, for some depression among institutionalized older adults, the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of morning bright light treatment on depression among older adults residing in a long-term care facility. METHODS: In a placebo controlled, crossover design, participants (N = 10, six women and four men; M age = 83.8) received each of the following: (i) 1 week (5 days) of 10,000 lux (therapeutic dose); (ii) 1 week (5 days) of 300 lux (placebo); or 1 week of no treatment (control).
