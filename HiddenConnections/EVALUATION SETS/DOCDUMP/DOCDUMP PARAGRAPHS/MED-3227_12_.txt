No association was found between statin use and PIB index, nor did controlling for cholesterol treatment in the statistical models alter the basic findings. Conclusions and Relevance Elevated cerebral Aβ was associated with cholesterol fractions in a pattern analogous to that found in coronary artery disease. This finding, in living, non-demented humans, is consistent with prior autopsy reports, with epidemiological findings, and with both animal and in vitro work suggesting an important role for cholesterol in Aβ processing.
