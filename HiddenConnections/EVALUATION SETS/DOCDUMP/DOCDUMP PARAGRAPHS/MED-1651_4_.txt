Breath hydrogen excretion and occurrence of bloating, abdominal pain, discomfort, flatulence, and diarrhea were measured for 8 hr. The administration of 1200 GalU of alpha-galactosidase induced a significant reduction of both breath hydrogen excretion and severity of flatulence. A reduction in severity was apparent for all considered symptoms, but both 300 and 1200 GalU induced a significant reduction in the total symptom score.
