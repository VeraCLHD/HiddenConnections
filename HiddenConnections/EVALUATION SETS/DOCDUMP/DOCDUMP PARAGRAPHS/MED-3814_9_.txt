These results indicate that measured arterial branch lengths or lumen volumes can potentially be used to predict the expected hyperemic flow in an arterial tree. This, in conjunction with measured hyperemic flow in the presence of a stenosis, could be used to predict fractional flow reserve based entirely on angiographic data.
