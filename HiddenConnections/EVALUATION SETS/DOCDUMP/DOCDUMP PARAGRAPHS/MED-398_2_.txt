OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the suitability of a tomato extract for use as a dietary supplement to prevent platelet activation. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted in 90 healthy human subjects selected for normal platelet function. Changes from baseline hemostatic function were measured 3 h after consumption of extract-enriched or control supplements.
