Squatting and leg-crossing aborted syncope in 7 of 8 patients, but handgrip aborted syncope in only 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Squatting and leg-crossing with muscle tensing improved the hemodynamics of normal subjects as well as those of patients with vasovagal syncope. Squatting and leg-crossing can be used as a simple and effective preventive maneuver in patients with vasovagal syncope.
