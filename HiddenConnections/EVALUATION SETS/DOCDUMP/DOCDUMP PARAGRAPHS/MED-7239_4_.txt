If nitrate is taken up by the plant and not metabolised to amino acids, proteins or nucleic acids, it is stored in cell vacuoles as a reserve. However, with an over-supply of nitrate relative to possible photosynthesis, this stored nitrate is still present at harvest and leads to high concentrations in plant tissue. The nitrate content in plants also depends upon other factors, such as plant variety (cultivar), kind and amount of fertiliser, time of harvest and environmental factors such as light intensity, temperature, etc.
