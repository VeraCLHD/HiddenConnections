MPP+ is a substrate for catecholamine uptake sites and is concentrated in these neurons. The molecular mechanism of MPP+ toxicity has not been established definitively, but conversion to a free radical or uptake by mitochondria and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, leading to calcium release and cell death have been suggested. The discovery of toxin which causes an animal model of Parkinson's disease has stimulated new research on environmental factors that might contribute to this progressive degenerative disorder and provides a means for assessing new approaches to therapy.
