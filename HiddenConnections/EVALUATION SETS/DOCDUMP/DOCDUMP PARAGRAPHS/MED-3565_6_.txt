Higher intakes of fish, EPA, or DHA were not associated with a lower risk of suicide. Multivariate HRs (95% CI) of suicide death for the highest versus lowest quintile of fish consumption were 0.95 (0.60-1.49) and 1.20 (0.58-2.47) for men and women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of suicidal death was observed among women with very low intake of fish, with HRs (95% CI) for those in 0-5th percentile versus middle quintile of 3.41 (1.36-8.51).
