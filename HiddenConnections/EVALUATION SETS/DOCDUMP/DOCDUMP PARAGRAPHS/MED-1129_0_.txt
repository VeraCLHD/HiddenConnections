Abstract Context Though multivitamins aim to prevent vitamin and mineral deficiency, there is a perception that multivitamins may prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Observational studies examining regular multivitamin use have been inconsistently associated with CVD, with no long-term clinical trials of multivitamin use. Objective To determine whether long-term multivitamin supplementation decreases the risk of major cardiovascular events among men.
