Results did not vary by diabetes status for microalbuminuria and eGFR outcomes or in those without hypertension at baseline for eGFR decline. No significant associations were seen for other types of protein, fat, vitamins, folate, fructose, or potassium. Conclusions: Higher dietary intake of animal fat and two or more servings per week of red meat may increase risk for microalbuminuria.
