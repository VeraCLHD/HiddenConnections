Therefore, we studied urinary phthalate metabolite patterns over a period of strict fasting and additionally recorded personal activity patterns with a diary to investigate non-dietary routes of exposure. Five individuals (3 female, 2 male, 27-47 years of age) fasted on glass-bottled water only over a 48-h period. All urine void events were captured in full, and measured for metabolites of the high molecular weight (HMW) di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) and di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), and the low molecular weight (LMW) di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di-iso-butyl phthalate (DiBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP).
