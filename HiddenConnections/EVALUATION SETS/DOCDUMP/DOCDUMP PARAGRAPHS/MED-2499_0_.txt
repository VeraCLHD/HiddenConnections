Abstract Around one of three diabetic patients is affected by distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) which represents a major health problem, as it may present with partly excruciating neuropathic pain and is responsible for substantial morbidity and increased mortality. Treatment is based on four cornerstones: (1) multifactorial intervention aimed at (near)-normoglycaemia and reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, (2) treatment based on pathogenetic mechanisms, (3) symptomatic treatment, and (4) avoidance of risk factors and complications. Among the pathogenetic treatments only alpha-lipoic acid and epalrestat are available for treatment in several countries.
