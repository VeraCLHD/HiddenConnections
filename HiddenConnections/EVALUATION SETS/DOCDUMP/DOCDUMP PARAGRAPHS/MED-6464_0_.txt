Abstract Esophageal cancer is highly aggressive and is a common cancer both worldwide and in the US. In the past two decades, the incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in the US have both increased, where as the incidence and mortality of other cancers have decreased. Although esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma differ in their histology and epidemiologic distribution, some of their risk factors (e.g. dietary deficiencies and tobacco) and underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis are the same.
