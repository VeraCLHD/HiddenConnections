Abstract The aim of this work is to assess the association between vasculogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) and coronary artery disease in men above the age of 40 y. The study included 40 patients above 40 y of age with vasculogenic ED of more than 3 months duration. A dynamic duplex study after intracavernosal injection of a bimix solution (60 mg papaverine + 2 mg phentolamine mesylate) was carried out using a color ultrasound machine.
