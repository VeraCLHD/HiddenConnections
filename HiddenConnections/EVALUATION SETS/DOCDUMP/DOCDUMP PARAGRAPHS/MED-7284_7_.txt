TPL was also found to induce dose and time dependent increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species in both the cell lines. Present results have demonstrated that MCF 7 and T 47 D cells exhibited differential sensitivity to TPL, which seems to be dependant on their p53 status. Inhibition of anti-proliferative ability of TPL by antioxidants suggests a role for TPL induced ROS in the induction of apoptosis.
