To this end, we evaluated whether consuming kiwi fruit modulated platelet activity and plasma lipids in human volunteers in a randomized cross-over study. We report that consuming two or three kiwi fruit per day for 28 days reduced platelet aggregation response to collagen and ADP by 18% compared with the controls (P < 0.05). In addition, consumption of kiwi fruit lowered blood triglycerides levels by 15% compared with control (P < 0.05), whereas no such effects were observed in the case of cholesterol levels.
