SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled comparisons of NSAID therapies versus placebo, versus other NSAIDs or versus paracetamol when used to treat primary dysmenorrhoea. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trials for quality and extracted data, calculating odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes. Crossover trial data were presented in additional tables and other data were summarised descriptively.
