The BDG consumption for 4 weeks significantly increased both circulating levels and adipose tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in overweight and obese humans. Insulin sensitivity as well as circulating levels and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines were unaffected by BDG treatment. Increased IL-10 after BDG consumption might be a contributing factor to the known beneficial effects of dietary fiber intake.
