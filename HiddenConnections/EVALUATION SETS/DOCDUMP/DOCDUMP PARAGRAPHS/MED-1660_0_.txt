Abstract During the slaughter process, cattle carcasses are split by sawing centrally down the vertebral column, resulting in contamination of each half with spinal cord material. Using a novel method based on a real-time PCR assay, we measured saw-mediated tissue transfer among carcasses. Up to 2.5% of the tissue recovered from each of the five subsequent carcasses by swabbing the split vertebral face came from the first carcass to be split; approximately 9 mg was spinal cord tissue.
