CONCLUSIONS: In light of the increased use of dietary supplements by women during pregnancy, the willingness of personnel in health food stores to make any recommendations should foster concerns by patients and healthcare providers alike. Use of dietary supplements contraindicated in pregnancy could cause significant harm to the mother and/or fetus. Studies are needed to address the need for more stringent guidelines regarding health food stores and their recommendations.
