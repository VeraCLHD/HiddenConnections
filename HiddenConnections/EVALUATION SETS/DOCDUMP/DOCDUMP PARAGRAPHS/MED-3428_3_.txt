Assessments of DE included tear osmolarity (Tosm), the 5-item dry eye questionnaire (DEQ-5), rating of eye dryness using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and noninvasive tear film breakup time (NITBUT). Hydration assessment was performed by measuring Posm using freezing-point depression osmometry. RESULTS: Posm was higher in DE than control (CON), indicating suboptimal hydration when using the 316 mOsm/L Tosm cutoff for DE (mean Posm + 11 mOsm/kg versus CON, P = 0.004, Cohen's effect size [d]) = 0.83) and the more conservative Tosm classification for DE where Tosm >324 and CON <308 mOsm/L (mean Posm + 12 mOsm/kg versus CON, P = 0.006, d = 0.94).
