Retinal vascular caliber changes reflect cumulative response to aging, cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, nitric oxide-dependent endothelial dysfunction, and other processes. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that changes in retinal arteriolar and venular caliber size may reflect the differential effects of a range of systemic, environmental, and genetic risk factors. Narrower retinal arteriolar caliber and smaller arteriovenous ratio are associated with older age; higher levels of past, current, and future blood pressure and obesity; and predict the incidence of diabetes and coronary heart disease.
