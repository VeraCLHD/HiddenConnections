The study population consisted of 180 postmenopausal women who participated in a descriptive cross-sectional study. A urine sample was collected from each subject to determine phytate levels and the volunteers were divided into two groups according to phytate urinary concentration (i.e., low and high levels). Bone mineral density was determined in the lumbar spine and femoral neck of groups with low and high phytate urinary levels.
