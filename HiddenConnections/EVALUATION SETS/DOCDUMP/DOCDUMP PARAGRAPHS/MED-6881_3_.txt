The aim of this review is to collate data on the effects of these metabolic modifiers on meat quality, and then discuss these overall effects. When data from the literature are collated and subject to meta-analyses it appears that conservative use of each of these technologies will result in a 5-10% (0.3-0.5kg) increase in shear force with a similar reduction in perception of tenderness. However, it should be borne in mind that the magnitude of these increases are similar to those observed with similar increases in carcass leanness obtained through other means (e.g. nutritional, genetic selection) and may be an inherent consequence of the production of leaner meat.
