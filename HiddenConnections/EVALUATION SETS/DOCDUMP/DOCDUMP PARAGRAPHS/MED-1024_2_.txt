The effect of IP6 on the release of IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 by neutrophils attached to either plastic or laminin for up to 6 hours in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was investigated. An increase in IL-8 secretion by stimulated cells occurred in the presence of IP6. The incubation of cells attached to laminin with IP6 alone (100-250 BM) did not effect cell morphology, but in the presence of 10(-7) M fMLP altered cell shape.
