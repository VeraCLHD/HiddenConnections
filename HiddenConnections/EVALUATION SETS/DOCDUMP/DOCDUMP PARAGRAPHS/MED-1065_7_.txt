The Japanese cedar pollen sensitization rate was found to be significantly correlated with the year of survey, age, and degree of urbanization (adjusted R(2) = 0.55). The coefficient for the correlation between the prevalence and the sensitization rate revealed a statistically significant correlation (Pearson's r = 0.70, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Japanese cedar pollinosis among adolescents was predicted to be 28.7% in metropolitan areas and 24.5% in the general population in urban areas in the year 2004, derived from the estimated sensitization rate and the relationship between sensitization rate and prevalence.
