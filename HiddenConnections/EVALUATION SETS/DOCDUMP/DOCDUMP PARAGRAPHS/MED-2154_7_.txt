UVA irradiation (10 mW cm(-2)) increased the yield of NO-related products by microdialysis, peaking after 30 minutes. Dialysis with noradrenaline abrogated this rise. Both the skin and the dermal vasculature contain biologically significant stores of NO, particularly nitrite, which can be directly mobilized by UVA irradiation.
