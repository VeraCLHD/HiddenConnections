Presupplementation, UVR induced an increase in MMP-1 (P = 0·01) and a reduction in fibrillin-1 (P = 0·03). Postsupplementation, UVR-induced MMP-1 was reduced in the tomato paste vs. control group (P = 0·04), while the UVR-induced reduction in fibrillin-1 was similarly abrogated in both groups, and an increase in pCI deposition was seen following tomato paste (P = 0·05). mtDNA 3895-bp deletion following 3 × MED UVR was significantly reduced postsupplementation with tomato paste (P = 0·01).
