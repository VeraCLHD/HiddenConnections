RESULTS: Viewing the weather information video did not cause emotion with tears in any patients, and it failed to modulate allergic responses. In contrast, viewing Kramer vs. Kramer caused emotion with tears in 44 of 60 patients, and it reduced allergic skin wheal responses to latex and latex-specific IgE production in them. CONCLUSION: Emotion with tears reduced allergic responses, and it may be useful in the treatment of allergic diseases.
