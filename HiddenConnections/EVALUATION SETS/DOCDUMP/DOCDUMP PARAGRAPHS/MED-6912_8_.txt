Our calculations indicate that dietary sources (EDI(dietary)) account for the overwhelming proportion of (>99% for PFOS and 98% for PFOA) total daily intake (TDI) in adults. The analyzed foodstuffs (meat, meat products, and eggs) were not the major contributors to dietary exposure to PFOS, whereas, meat was the primary contributor to dietary exposure to PFOA.
