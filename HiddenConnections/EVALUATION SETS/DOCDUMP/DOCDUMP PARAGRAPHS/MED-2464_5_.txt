The intent-to-treat analysis included 56 subjects in the acarbose and 59 in the control group who had a baseline and endpoint measurement. RESULTS: A significant reduction of the progression of IMT(mean) was observed in the acarbose group versus placebo. After an average time of 3.9 years, IMT(mean) increased by 0.02 (0.07) mm in the acarbose group versus 0.05 (0.06) mm in the placebo group (P=0.027).
