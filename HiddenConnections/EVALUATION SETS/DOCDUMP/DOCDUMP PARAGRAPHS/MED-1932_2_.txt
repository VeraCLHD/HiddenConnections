We assessed appendicular muscle mass (AMM) using dual X-ray absorptiometry and calculated the skeletal muscle index (SMI) using the AMM divided by height squared (kg/m(2) ). Low muscle mass was defined as muscle mass minus two standard deviations below the mean for young healthy adults. Leg extension power (watts) was measured as an index of muscle function.
