Abstract Curcumin (Cur), a component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), has been reported to exhibit antimetastatic activities, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Other curcuminoids present in turmeric, demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) have not been investigated whether they exhibit antimetastatic activity to the same extent as curcumin. The regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) play important role in cancer cell invasion by cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM).
