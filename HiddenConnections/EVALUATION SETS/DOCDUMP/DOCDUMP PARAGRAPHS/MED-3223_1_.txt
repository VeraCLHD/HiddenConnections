Both the generation and clearance of Abeta are regulated by cholesterol. Elevated cholesterol levels increase Abeta in cellular and most animals models of AD, and drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis lower Abeta in these models. Recent studies show that not only the total amount, but also the distribution of cholesterol within neurons, impacts Abeta biogenesis.
