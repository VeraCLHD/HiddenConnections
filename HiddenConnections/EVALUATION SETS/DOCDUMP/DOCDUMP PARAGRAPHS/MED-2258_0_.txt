Abstract Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment adversely affect quality of life for most men. The true incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) after prostate cancer therapy is unknown, and the rates of ED in radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiation groups are similar, although the onset of ED is often later in patients treated with radiation therapy. Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of ED include neurovascular injury, local inflammatory changes, damage to nearby supporting structures, cavernosal smooth muscle hypoxia with ensuing smooth muscle apoptosis and fibrosis, and corporal veno-occlusive dysfunction causing venous leakage.
