Single cell gel electrophoresis with the incorporation of lesion-specific endonucleases further revealed that oxidized pyrimidines (endonuclease III-sensitive sites) contributed to most of the postexercise nucleotide oxidation. The oxidative DNA damage correlated significantly with plasma levels of creatinine kinase and lipid peroxidation metabolites, and lasted for more than 1 week following the race. This phenomenon may be one of the mechanisms behind the immune dysfunctions after exhaustive exercise.
