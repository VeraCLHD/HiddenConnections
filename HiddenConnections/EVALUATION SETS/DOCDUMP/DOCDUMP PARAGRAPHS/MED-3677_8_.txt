ER stress was also proposed as a mechanism linking high-fat-diet-induced obesity with insulin resistance. This cellular stress response may thus be a common molecular pathway for the two main causes of Type 2 diabetes, namely insulin resistance and beta-cell loss. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to pancreatic beta-cell loss will pave the way for the development of novel and targeted approaches to prevent Type 2 diabetes.
