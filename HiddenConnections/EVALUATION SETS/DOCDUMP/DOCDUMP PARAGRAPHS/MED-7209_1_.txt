Caco-2 cells were cultured under standard conditions and treated with increasing concentrations of SFN [1-20 μM] and/or Ox [100 nM-10 μM]. For co-incubation, cells were pre-treated with SFN for 24 h. Cell growth was determined by BrdU incorporation. Drug interactions were assessed using the combination-index method (CI) (Cl < 1 indicates synergism).
