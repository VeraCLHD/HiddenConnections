Abstract To our knowledge, there is no previous clinical description in the literature of patients with defecation syncope. We evaluated 20 patients with this disorder who were a subgroup of a larger, prospective study of syncope, 13 women and seven men, with a mean age of 59 years. Eleven patients had had one episode and nine had experienced multiple episodes.
