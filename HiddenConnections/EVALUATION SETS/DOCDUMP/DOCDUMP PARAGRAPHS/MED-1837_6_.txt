The respondents also showed four biases hypothesized to cause resistance to HRT: omission bias (more concern about harmful acts than harmful omissions); proportionality bias (attention to relative risk rather than risk differences); naturalness bias (preference for the natural); and ambiguity (avoiding options with missing information). Proportion bias, naturalness bias, and (weakly) omission bias were related to less favorable attitudes toward HRT. CONCLUSION: Although specialists are highly favorable toward HRT in general, some negativity toward HRT may result from decision biases.
