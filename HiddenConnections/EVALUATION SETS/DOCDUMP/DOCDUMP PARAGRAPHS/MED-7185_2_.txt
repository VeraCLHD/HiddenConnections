The results support literature observations on the preferential accumulation of contaminants in liver tissue, as the highest concentrations of PCDD/Fs were observed in liver, relative to the other organs (e.g. 8.4 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) lamb liver compared to 1.1 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) lamb kidney and 1.27 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) lamb heart). Offal products generally showed lower contaminant levels which may be a result of processing or dilution. For most samples, the main contribution to WHO-TEQ arose from PCDD/Fs rather than PCBs.
