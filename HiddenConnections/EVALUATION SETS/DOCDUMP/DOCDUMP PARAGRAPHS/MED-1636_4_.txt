OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the study for evaluation of lipids, lipoproteins, and apoproteins. RESULTS: Fifty-three (53) patients concluded the study. In the ST group, mean of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) increased significantly (p = 0.002) at the end of the study, whereas changes in apolipoprotein-A1, and lipoprotein (a) were not significant.
