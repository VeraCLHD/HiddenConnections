A secondary objective was to examine the extent to which metabolic (body mass index, high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein) markers mediate the relationship between screen time and CVD events. BACKGROUND: Although some evidence suggests that prolonged sitting is linked to CVD risk factor development regardless of physical activity participation, studies with hard outcomes are scarce. METHODS: A population sample of 4,512 (1,945 men) Scottish Health Survey 2003 respondents (â‰¥35 years) were followed up to 2007 for all-cause mortality and CVD events (fatal and nonfatal combined).
