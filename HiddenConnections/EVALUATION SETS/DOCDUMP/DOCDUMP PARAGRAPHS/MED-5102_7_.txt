α-Gal epitopes produced by Trypanosoma cruzi interact with anti-Gal and induce ‘autoimmune like’ inflammatory reactions in Chagas' disease. Anti-Gal IgM and IgG further mediate rejection of xenografts expressing α-gal epitopes. Because of its abundance, anti-Gal may be exploited for various clinical uses.
