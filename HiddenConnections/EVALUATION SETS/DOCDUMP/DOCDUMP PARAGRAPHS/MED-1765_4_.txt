VDR polymorphisms (rs1544410, rs10735810, rs7975232, rs11568820) were genotyped, and haplotypes were inferred by using BEAGLE software. We tested for association between survival and 25-OHD, VDR genotype/haplotype, and after applying a VDR genotype-25-OHD interaction term. We conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs).
