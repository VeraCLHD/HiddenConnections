No association was present for prostate cancer overall (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.11), Gleason 2-6 disease (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.18), or Gleason 7 disease (OR=0.93, 95% CI 0.69-1.24). Conclusion These prospective results support that men with low cholesterol have a reduced risk of high-grade prostate cancer. These and other contemporary data suggest that cholesterol metabolism should be investigated further in the etiology of prostate cancer.
