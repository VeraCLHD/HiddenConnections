PBDEs were correlated with lipids only in the skinned samples, suggesting that there is greater accumulation and retention of PBDEs in muscle lipids than in skin-associated fat. In skin-on samples, modest correlations were observed between concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs (R(2)=0.47) and mono-ortho PCBs (R(2)=0.50), whereas PBDEs were not correlated with non-ortho PCBs.
