A total of 338 incident cases of acute myeloid leukemia were ascertained. Multivariate Cox models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Compared with those for never smokers, hazard ratios were 1.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.75), 1.79 (95% confidence interval: 1.32, 2.42), 2.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.63, 3.57), and 2.29 (85% confidence interval: 1.38, 3.79) for former smokers who smoked ≤1 or >1 pack/day and for current smokers who smoked ≤1 or >1 pack/day, respectively.
