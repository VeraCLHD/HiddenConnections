Abstract The meat industry is undergoing a period of very mixed fortunes with beef in particular losing market share; however, longer term forecasts are good for all meat species with demand growth coming mainly from developing countries. This review deals in particular with the main problems that are responsible for the decline of beef as a consumer product in developed markets. These are the meat safety crisis and the unreliability of meat eating quality, especially tenderness.
