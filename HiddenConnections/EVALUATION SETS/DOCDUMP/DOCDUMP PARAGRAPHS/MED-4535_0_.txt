Abstract OBJECTIVES: To determine seminal antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress markers, and their association with semen quality as oxidative stress is considered to be a major etiological factor in male infertility. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Semen samples were obtained from 138 men and categorized on the basis of sperm count, motility, and morphology. Seminal oxidative and antioxidant markers are as follows: lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyls (PC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), thiols, and ascorbic acid were determined.
