Abstract BACKGROUND: Few recent epidemiologic studies have assessed the effect that nut consumption (including tree nuts and peanuts) has on health risks, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). OBJECTIVE: This study compared the health risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and MetS of nut consumers with that of nonconsumers. DESIGN: Adults 19+ years (n = 13,292) participating in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used.
