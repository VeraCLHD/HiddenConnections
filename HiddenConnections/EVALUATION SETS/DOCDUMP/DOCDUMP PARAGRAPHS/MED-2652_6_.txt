For green tea, the summary RR indicated a significant association between the highest green tea consumption and reduced risk of CAD (summary RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.89). Furthermore, an increase in green tea consumption of 1 cup/d was associated with a 10% decrease in the risk of developing CAD (summary RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support a protective role of black tea against CAD.
