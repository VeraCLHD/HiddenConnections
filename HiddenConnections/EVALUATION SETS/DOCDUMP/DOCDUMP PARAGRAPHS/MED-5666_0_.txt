Abstract The effect of alternative dietary habits and prolonged lactation on the nutrient and contaminant concentrations in human milk was studied. The study sample consisted of mothers on macrobiotic diets, containing little or no diary products and meat, at 2-3 months postpartum (n = 9) and 9-13 months postpartum (n = 12), and mothers on omnivorous diets at 2-3 months postpartum (n = 10). Protein and zinc concentrations in breast-milk from macrobiotic mothers decreased with stage of lactation.
