Therefore, this study examined different slaughter techniques to determine their effects on pH (24 h), color (L*a*b* values at 24 h), lipid oxidation, residual hemoglobin concentration (24 h), and sensory evaluation (d 1 and 4 postmortem; PM) in broiler breast fillets. The treatments included 1) CO(2) slaughter and not bled, 2) no stunning and bled, 3) electrical stunning (ES) and bled, 4) CO(2) stunning and bled, and 5) ES and decapitation. The birds were conventionally processed, and analyses were performed at 24 h PM except residual hemoglobin for which the samples were frozen (-80 degrees C) until analyses ( < 2 mo).
