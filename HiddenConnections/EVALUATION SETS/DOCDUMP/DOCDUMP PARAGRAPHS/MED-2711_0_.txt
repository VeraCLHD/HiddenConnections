Abstract There is a great deal of evidence to support a pathogenic role of oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the sources of reactive oxygen species have not been directly demonstrated. In this study, using a novel in situ detection system, we show that neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques are major sites for catalytic redox reactivity. Pretreatment with deferoxamine or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid abolishes the ability of the lesions to catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), strongly suggesting the involvement of associated transition metal ions.
