Human intervention studies have documented protective effects for Î²-carotene or for lycopene provided either by a carotenoid-rich diet or by supplementation. In exposed tissues, light induces primary and secondary photooxidative processes. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species is considered to be a mechanism of action underlying the protective activity of carotenoids.
