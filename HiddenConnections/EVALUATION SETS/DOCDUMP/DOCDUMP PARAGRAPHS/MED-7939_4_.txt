RESULTS: A significant treatment-by-time effect impacted serum TC (p = 0.026) and LDL (p = 0.033) after eight weeks. Paired t-tests indicated that pinto beans were responsible for this effect (p = 0.003; p = 0.008). Mean change of serum TC for pinto bean, black-eyed pea and placebo were -19 +/- 5, 2.5 +/- 6, and 1 +/- 5 mg/dL, respectively (p = 0.011).
