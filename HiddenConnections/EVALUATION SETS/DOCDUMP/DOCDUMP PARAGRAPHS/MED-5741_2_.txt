In rats, NTP found "equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity" in females based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and "no evidence of carcinogenic activity" in males. However, dose-related, statistically significant decreases in multiple tumors were observed in both male and female rats exposed to 4-MEI in the NTP bioassay. For example, 4-MEI was associated with a 25-fold decrease in the incidence of mammary tumors among high dose females.
