Abstract Breast pain is a common condition affecting most women at some stage in their reproductive life. Mastalgia is resistant to treatment in 6% of cyclical and 26% non-cyclical patients. Surgery is not widely used to treat this condition and only considered in patients with severe mastalgia resistant to medication.
