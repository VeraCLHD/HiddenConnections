Abstract OBJECTIVES: This prospective, randomised in vitro study was to investigate the pH and titratable acidity of fruit smoothie drinks and to assess the effect of these drinks on enamel erosion. METHOD: Fifty enamel slabs were divided into five groups which were allocated to the sample solutions groups: Innocent(®) smoothie strawberries and bananas (SB), Innocent(®) smoothie mangoes and passion fruit (MP) and Diet Coke. Distilled deionised water (DD) was used as negative control and citric acid 0.3% as positive control.
