DESIGN: Sucrose-dependent biofilm formation by S. mutans cultured in the presence of VcPP was measured by crystal violet dye uptake. Inhibition of adhesion to the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) beads was quantified using fluorescent-labelled cells. The MIC for S. mutans was determined by colony counting on agar plates containing VcPP.
