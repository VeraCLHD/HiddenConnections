To determine if PhIP causes DNA strand breaks in MCF-10A cells, cells were treated for 3, 6, 9, and 24 h with PhIP (100 microM), DAS (100 microM) and a combination of PhIP (100 microM) and DAS (100 microM). DNA strand breaks were evaluated using the Comet assay. PhIP produced DNA strand breaks in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.
