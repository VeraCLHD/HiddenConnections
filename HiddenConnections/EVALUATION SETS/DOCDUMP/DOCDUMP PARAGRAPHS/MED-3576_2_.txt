A series of measures of tactile performance and response were obtained from 22 female subjects, namely: (1) the subjective assessment of lip feel, (2) tactile sensitivity, (3) spatial acuity, (4) thermal sensitivity, and (5) the subjective assessment of thermal stimulation. These measures were obtained from lips in their natural (untreated) state, and lips that had been treated using a hydrating preparation. The preparation altered the subjective feel of the lips consistent with the treatment increasing lip hydration and compliance.
