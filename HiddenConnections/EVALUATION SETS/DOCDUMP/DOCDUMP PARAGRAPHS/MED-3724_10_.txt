In the 32 observational studies (a total of 21,604 participants; mean age, 46.6 years), consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with lower mean systolic BP (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -9.1 to -4.7; P < .001; I2 = 91.4; P < .001 for heterogeneity) and diastolic BP (-4.7 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.3 to -3.1; P < .001; I2 = 92.6; P < .001 for heterogeneity) compared with the consumption of omnivorous diets. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Consumption of vegetarian diets is associated with lower BP. Such diets could be a useful nonpharmacologic means for reducing BP.
