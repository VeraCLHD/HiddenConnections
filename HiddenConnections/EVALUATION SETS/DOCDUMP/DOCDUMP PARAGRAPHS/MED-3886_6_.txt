This warrants detailed evaluations on the contemporary release of PCDD/Fs to the environment after the use of pesticides. Changes in congener profiles (including the ratio of PCDDs to PCDFs (DF ratio)) suggest that pesticide sources of PCDD/Fs after sunlight exposure may not be recognized based on matching source fingerprints established from manufacturing impurities. These changes also provide preliminary insights into the possible formation routes and types of precursors involved.
