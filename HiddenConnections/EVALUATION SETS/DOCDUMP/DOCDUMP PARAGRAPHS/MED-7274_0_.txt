Abstract Evidence suggests that endothelial dysfunction is on the causal pathway for both atherogenesis and destabilization of established plaques. In this review, the role of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) as a non-invasive method to assess endothelial function is discussed. Technical modifications and development of analysis software have significantly improved the variability of the method.
