Placebo ingestion did not restore euglycemia or R. Plasma glucose increased (P less than 0.001) initially to approximately 5 mM and R rose (P less than 0.001) to approximately 0.83 with glucose infusion or carbohydrate ingestion. Plasma glucose and R then fell gradually to 3.9 +/- 0.3 mM and 0.81 +/- 0.01, respectively, after carbohydrate ingestion but were maintained at 5.1 +/- 0.1 mM and 0.83 +/- 0.01, respectively, by glucose infusion. Time to fatigue during this second exercise bout was significantly longer during the carbohydrate ingestion (26 +/- 4 min; P less than 0.05) or glucose infusion (43 +/- 5 min; P less than 0.01) trials compared with the placebo trial (10 +/- 1 min).
