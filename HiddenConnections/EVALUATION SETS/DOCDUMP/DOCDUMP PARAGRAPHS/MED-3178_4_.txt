Nine patients completed the trial, 2 others dropped out because they could not tolerate the VPD, 3 because of unrelated medical complications, and 1 for technical reasons. The caloric intake was higher and the protein, phosphate and essential amino acid intake lower on the VPD than on the APD. The compliance with the suggested caloric intake was better with the VPD than with the APD (97 vs. 88% of recommended intake), as was the compliance with the suggested protein intake (94 vs. 112% of recommended intake) and with the suggested phosphate intake (102 vs. 116%).
