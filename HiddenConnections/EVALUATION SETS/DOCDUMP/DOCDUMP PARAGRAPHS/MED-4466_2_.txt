SUBJECTS: We surveyed 222 patients with congenital IGF-I deficiency (Laron syndrome, GH gene deletion, GHRH receptor defects and IGF-I resistance) and 338 first and second-degree relatives. RESULTS: None of the IGF-I deficient patients had cancer, whereas 9-24% of the family members had a history of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Congenital IGF-I deficiency acts as a protecting factor for the development of cancer.
