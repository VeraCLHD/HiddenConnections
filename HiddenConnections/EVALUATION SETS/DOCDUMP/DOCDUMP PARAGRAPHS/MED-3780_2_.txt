The aim of this study was to examine the associations between heme iron and nonheme iron intake and stroke incidence in men. METHODS: The population-based prospective Cohort of Swedish Men included 38 859 men, aged 45 to 79 years, who had no history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer at baseline. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
