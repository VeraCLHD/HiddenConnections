Furthermore, Akt/GSK-3 signaling was down-regulated in sporamin-treated cells. Consistently, the phosphorylated Bad was significantly declined in sporamin-treated Tca8113 cells. These results suggest the antiproliferative effects of sporamin in Tca8113 cells might result partly from induction of apoptosis by down-regulating Akt/GSK-3 pathway.
