Non-dietary risk factors included miscarriage (especially at first pregnancy), use of fertility drugs, family history of thyroid disease, obesity, and work as a farm laborer. The odds ratio for the combined effect of a high iodine intake and a first-pregnancy miscarriage was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-19.2); and for high iodine intake and use of fertility drugs 7.3 (95 percent CI = 1.5-34.5). Among men, positive associations were found for obesity, work as a farm laborer, and a past history of benign thyroid disease.
