Vitamin D supplementation did not influence the standardized mean difference (SMD) for body weight, FM, %FM or LBM. A small but non-significant decrease in BMI (SMD = -0.097, 95% confidence interval: [-0.210, 0.016], P = 0.092) was observed. Meta-regression confirmed that neither the absolute vitamin D status achieved nor its change from baseline influenced the SMD of any obesity measure.
