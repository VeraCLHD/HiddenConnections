This was also true during the third 10-minute period (P = .03). Thus, on average, the effect size of music on REE is a reduction of approximately 10% to 13% from baseline, an effect obtained within 10 to 30 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to Mozart music significantly lowers REE in healthy preterm infants.
