The aim of this paper is to review the epidemiologic evidence linking ultraviolet (UV) radiation and cataract. METHODS: Published epidemiologic research articles on UV and cataract were reviewed against the epidemiologic criteria for causality: biological plausibility, strength of the association, specificity, experimental evidence, temporal sequence of events, dose-response relationship, and consistency. RESULTS: The majority of the 22 epidemiologic studies reviewed met most of the epidemiologic criteria for causality and support an association between UV-B and the development of cortical cataract and perhaps posterior subcapsular cataract.
