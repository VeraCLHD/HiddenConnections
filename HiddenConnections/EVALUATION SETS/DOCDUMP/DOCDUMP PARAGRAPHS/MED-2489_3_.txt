In fact, the effects of acute and chronic AMPK activation in the WAT induce profound changes in adiposity with important implications for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic disorders. This review discusses the role of AMPK in the regulation of white adipocyte metabolism with respect to energy storage and release, gene expression, mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative capacity, cell differentiation, and the potential impact on whole-body adiposity and energy homeostasis.
