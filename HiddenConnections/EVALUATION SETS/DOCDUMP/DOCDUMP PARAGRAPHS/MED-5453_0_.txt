Abstract Lipid peroxidation is, in most instances, a free radical chain reaction that can be described in terms of initiation, propagation, branching and termination processes. With regard to lipid peroxidation, one of the most important questions concerns the source of the primary catalysts that initiate peroxidation in situ in muscle foods. When cells are injured, such as in muscle foods after slaughtering, lipid peroxidation is favored, and traces of O(2) and H(2)O(2), indicating lipid peroxides, are formed.
