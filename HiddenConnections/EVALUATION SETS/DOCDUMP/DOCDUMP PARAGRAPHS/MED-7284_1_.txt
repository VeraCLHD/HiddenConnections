In vitro studies showed that MCF 7 with wild type p53 was more sensitive to TPL than T 47 D, which is p53 negative. TPL induced loss of cell viability was determined by MTT assay. After 72h incubation, the IC 50 values for MCF 7 was found to be approximately 8microg/ml and that for T 47 D was approximately 26microg/ml.
