RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with detectable IgE antibodies against aeroallergens increased consistently from the oldest to the youngest birth cohorts; chi2 trend=56.809, P<0.0001. Similar progression was not seen in sensitization to dietary allergens. The proportion of those with diagnosed asthma differed significantly (chi2=13.45, P=0.004) across the birth cohorts.
