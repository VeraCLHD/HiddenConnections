OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the bioavailability of Cd from vegetable and animal-based foods. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Caco-2 cells were exposed to Cd in boiled pig kidney, ark shell, kale, raw kale, mixed boiled pig kidney with raw kale and CdCl2 after in vitro digestion. Then cellular Cd uptake from the digests and reference CdCl2 solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry.
