For both techniques, a spatial resolution of 5-10 microm was achieved. FTIRM results showed that the amyloid plaques have elevated beta-sheet content, as demonstrated by a strong amide I absorbance at 1625cm(-1). Using SXRF microprobe, we find that AD tissue also contains "hot spots" of accumulated metal ions, specifically Cu and Zn, with a strong spatial correlation between these two ions.
