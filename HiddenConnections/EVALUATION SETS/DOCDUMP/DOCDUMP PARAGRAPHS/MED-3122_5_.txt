Two pairs of independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed the validity of the study data according to six quality criteria. We calculated the differences in blood pressure change between the calcium supplementation and control groups and pooled the estimates with each trial weighted with the inverse of the variance using a random effects model. The predictors of blood pressure reduction that we examined included method of supplementation, baseline blood pressure, and the methodologic quality of the studies.
