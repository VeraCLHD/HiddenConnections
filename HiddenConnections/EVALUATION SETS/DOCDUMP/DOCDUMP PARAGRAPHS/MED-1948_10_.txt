Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors did not have enough data for a reliable meta-analysis of harm but seemed to be safe. More rigorous data were available for tricyclic antidepressants, alosetron, and rifaximin; the numbers needed to harm were 18.3, 19.4, and 8971, respectively, and the numbers needed to treat were 8, 7.5, and 10.6, respectively. For tricyclic antidepressant and alosetron, an adverse event resulting in discontinuation of the study medication occurred for every 2.3 and 2.6 patients who benefited from a drug, respectively.
