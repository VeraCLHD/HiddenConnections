Identifying persons with prediabetes and informing them about their increased risk for type 2 diabetes are first steps in encouraging persons with prediabetes to make healthy lifestyle changes. However, during 2005-2006, only approximately 7% of persons with prediabetes were aware that they had prediabetes. To examine recent changes in awareness of prediabetes and factors associated with awareness among adults agedâ‰¥20 years, CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
