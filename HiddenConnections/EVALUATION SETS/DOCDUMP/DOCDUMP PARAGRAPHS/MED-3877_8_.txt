However, as many as 12 out of 31 ICSFs (95% CI, 22 to 58%) assigned to a low animal protein diet achieved a reduction in the urine urea excretion rate of more than 50 mmol/day and also exhibited a significant decrease in urinary calcium excretion that averaged 1.8 mmol/day. A significant correlation between urea and calcium outputs was observed only among patients with hypercalciuria. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that only ICSFs who markedly decrease their animal protein intake, especially those with hypercalciuria, can expect to benefit from dietary recommendations.
