The absolute risks of SCD were 22, 17, 18, 13 and 16 cases/100,000 person-years among women with 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 low-risk factors, respectively. Compared to women with 0 low-risk factors, the multivariate relative risk of SCD was 0.54 (95%CI: 0.34, 0.86), 0.41 (95%CI: 0.25, 0.65), 0.33 (95%CI: 0.20, 0.54) and 0.08 (95%CI: 0.03, 0.23) for women with 1, 2, 3, and 4 low-risk factors, respectively. The proportion of SCD attributable to smoking, inactivity, overweight, and poor diet was 81% (95%CI: 52%, 93%).
