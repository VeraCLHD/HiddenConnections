Abstract BACKGROUND: n-3 (omega-3) Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), fish, and nuts can regulate inflammatory processes and responses. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether dietary intakes of PUFAs [n-3, n-6 (omega-6), and α-linolenic acid], fish, and nuts were associated with 15-y mortality attributed to noncardiovascular, noncancer inflammatory diseases. DESIGN: The analyses involved 2514 participants aged ≥49 y at baseline.
