Diastolic BP decreased on average 4.5 mmHg during JTD compared to the control diet (P=0.0066) while systolic BP was not affected. This effect was evident in normotensive subjects and similar to that seen in the recent studies. CONCLUSIONS: An ordinary nitrate rich diet may positively affect blood pressure.
