However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. This meta-analysis on 15,320 cancer cases and 19,534 controls from 34 published case-control studies shows no significant overall main effect of MnSOD Val-9Ala on cancer risk. However, we found that the MnSOD 9Ala allele was associated with an increased prostate cancer risk (Val/Ala versus Val/Val: odds ratio (OR)=1.1; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.0-1.3; Ala/Ala versus Val/Val: OR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.6; Val/Ala+Ala/Ala versus Val/Val: OR=1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3).
