Sodium sorbate caused significant induction of chromosome aberrations and SCE, and also induced 6-thioguanine-resistant mutations in a dose-dependent manner. The clastogenic potency of sodium sorbate was found to be less than one hundredth of that of the potent clastogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The induction of SCE by sodium sorbate was twice the control level, whereas that by methyl methanesulphonate, a potent inducer of SCE, was 14 times the control level.
