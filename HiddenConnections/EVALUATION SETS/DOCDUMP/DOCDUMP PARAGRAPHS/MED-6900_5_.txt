The analyses indicated that animal protein accounted for only 21% of dietary protein. CONCLUSION: This research suggests that the protein DRI for vegetarians consuming less than the expected amounts of animal protein (45% to 50% of total protein) may need to be adjusted from 0.8 to about 1.0 g/kg to account for decreased protein bioavailability.
