Using dermal microdialysis, suction blister epidermal samples, and sweat collection, we demonstrated cutaneous concentrations of total NO-related products of 12+/-5.97 microM, 0.03+/-0.03 micromol mg(-1) epidermal protein, and 22+/-9.34 microM, respectively. The predominant oxyanion was nitrate (60-75%) followed by nitrite. S-Nitrosothiols were barely detectable.
