METHODS: In October 2002, we attempted to collect information from the 591 men who had been diagnosed and registered with prostate cancer in 1999 in Stockholm County. In a postal questionnaire, men were asked to balance absence or presence of certain therapy-induced long-term symptoms against varying lengths of survival gain as a consequence of the therapy. RESULTS: Information was provided by 511 (86%) of the 591 men.
