Endothelial cell stiffness was unaffected by acute changes in sodium concentration <135 mM but rose steeply between 135 and 145 mM. The increase in stiffness occurred within minutes. Lack of aldosterone in the culture medium or treatment with the epithelial sodium channel inhibitor amiloride prevented this response.
