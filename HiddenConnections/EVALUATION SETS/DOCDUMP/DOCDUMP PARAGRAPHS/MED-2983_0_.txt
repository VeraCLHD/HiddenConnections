Abstract The concept of time-energy displacement is based on the hypothesis that unrefined complex carbohydrates of low energy density will prolong eating time and induce satiety at a low energy intake. The present study compared the effects of diets low in energy density and high in energy density on satiety, energy intake, and eating time among 20 obese and nonobese subjects. Each diet was served over a 5-day period, and subjects were allowed to eat to satiety.
