In this study, the effect of traditional heat processing methods on the microstructure and in vitro bioaccessibility of beta-carotene from OFSP were investigated. Bioaccessibility was determined using simulated in vitro digestion model followed by membrane filtration to separate the micellar fraction containing bioaccessible beta-carotene. Processing led to decrease in the amount of all-trans-beta-carotene and increase in 13-cis-beta-carotene.
