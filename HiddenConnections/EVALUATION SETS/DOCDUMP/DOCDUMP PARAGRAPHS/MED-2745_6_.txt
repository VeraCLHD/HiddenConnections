Changes in LV and VAT/SAT area were measured by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) LV, VAT/SAT, and body weight decreased significantly (P < 0.001 for all). The degree of LV reduction was directly related to the reduction in relative body weight (r = 0.54, P = 0.001) and initial LV (r = 0.43, P = 0.015).
