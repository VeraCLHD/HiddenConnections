Food discussion significantly (p < 0.02, Wilcoxon's rank sum test) increased colonic pressure activity compared with control or basal activity. Smell of food without sight or taste also significantly (p < 0.03) increased the colonic pressure activity compared with control and basal periods. Sham feeding and sight and smell of food without taste significantly (p < 0.02 and p < 0.03) increased colonic pressures compared with control but not basal activity.
