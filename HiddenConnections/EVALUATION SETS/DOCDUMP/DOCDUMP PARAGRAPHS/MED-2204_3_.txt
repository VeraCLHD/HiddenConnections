Additional vitamin D-sensitive diseases and conditions that account for 2 to 3% of global mortality rates are Alzheimer's disease, falls, meningitis, Parkinson's disease, maternal sepsis, maternal hypertension (pre-eclampsia) and multiple sclerosis. Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels from 54 to 110â€‰nmol/l would reduce the vitamin D-sensitive disease mortality rate by an estimated 20%. RESULTS: The reduction in all-cause mortality rates range from 7.6% for African females to 17.3% for European females.
