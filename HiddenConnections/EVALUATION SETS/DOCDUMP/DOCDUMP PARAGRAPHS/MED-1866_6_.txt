Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify EGF receptor levels. RESULTS: Butyrate and serum starvation (SS) both induced a cell cycle withdrawal by 24 hours. In response to EGF treatment, SS cells exhibited a growth spurt and induced c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogene expression, whereas butyrate-treated cells exhibited minimal growth response to EGF.
