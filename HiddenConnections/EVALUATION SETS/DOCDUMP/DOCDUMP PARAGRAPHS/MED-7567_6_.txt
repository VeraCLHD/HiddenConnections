CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile could be found relatively commonly in retail chicken meat, albeit at low levels. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to report C. difficile in chicken meat. Contamination of meat with C. difficile strains implicated in human infections raises concerns about food as a source of C. difficile infection.
