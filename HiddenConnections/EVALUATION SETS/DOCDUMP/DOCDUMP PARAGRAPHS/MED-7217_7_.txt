Excretion of NPIP in urine was not related to nitrate intake and composition of the diet. Intake of 250 mg and 1 g of ascorbic acid per day resulted in a significant decrease in urinary NDMA excretion during days 4-7 (p=0.0001), but not during days 1-3. Also, consumption of four cups of green tea per day (2 g) significantly decreased excretion of NDMA during days 4-7 (p=0.0035), but not during days 1-3.
