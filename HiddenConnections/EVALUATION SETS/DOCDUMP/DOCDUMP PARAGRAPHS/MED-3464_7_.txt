Greater caffeine intake was more adversely associated with POAG among those reporting family history of glaucoma, particularly in relation to POAG with elevated IOP (p for trend =0.0009; p-interaction=0.04). Conclusion Overall caffeine intake was not associated with increased risk of POAG. However, in secondary analyses, caffeine appeared to elevate risk of high-tension POAG among those with a family history of glaucoma; this may be due to chance, but warrants further study.
