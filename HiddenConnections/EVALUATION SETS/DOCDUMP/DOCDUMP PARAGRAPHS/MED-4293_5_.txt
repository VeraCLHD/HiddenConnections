Thirty-nine subjects (2.0%) had all four components of the ideal health behaviors index and 27 (1.4%) had all three components of the ideal health factors index. Blacks had significantly fewer ideal cardiovascular health components than whites (2.0±1.2 vs. 2.6±1.4, p<0.001). After adjustment by sex, age and income level, blacks had 82% lower odds of having ≥5 components of ideal cardiovascular health (Odds Ratio 0.18, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=0.10-0.34, p<0.001).
