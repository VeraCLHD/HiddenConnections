Cycle types also differed (chi 2 = 9.64, P < 0.01): vegetarians had fewer anovulatory cycles (4.6% vs 15.1% of cycles). Compared with those with restraint scores below the median, highly restrained women had fewer ovulatory cycles (3.6 +/- 2.3 vs 5.0 +/- 1.4, P < 0.05) and shorter mean luteal phase lengths (7.4 +/- 4.1 vs 10.7 +/- 3.1 d, P < 0.05). We conclude that ovulatory disturbances and restrained eating are less common among vegetarians, and that restraint influences ovulatory function.
