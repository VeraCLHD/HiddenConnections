The neuropathological demonstration of apolipoprotein E (apoE) within neuronal cytoplasm in a location suitable for proposed interaction with microtubule-associated protein tau and MAP2c has introduced a new view of neuronal neurobiology. As apoE is not known to be expressed in neurons, its relationship with cellular receptors, such as the low-density lipoprotein related receptor, and the mechanism of intracellular trafficking are now important research problems. The role of apoE as a metabolic co-factor in neuronal metabolism presents new possibilities for neuronal mechanisms of maintenance and response to stress.
