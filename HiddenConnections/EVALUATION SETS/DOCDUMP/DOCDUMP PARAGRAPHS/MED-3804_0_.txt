Abstract Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is accompanied by smell dysfunction, as measured by psychophysical tests. Currently it is unknown whether AD-related alterations in central olfactory system neural activity, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are detectable beyond those observed in healthy elderly. Moreover, it is not known whether such changes are correlated with indices of odor perception and dementia.
