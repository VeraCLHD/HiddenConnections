Performance was not different (p > 0.05) between the raisin (189.5 +/- 69.9 kJ) and gel (188.0 +/- 64.8 kJ) trials. Prior to exercise, serum concentrations of glucose and other fuel substrates did not differ between trials; however, insulin was higher (p < 0.05) for the gel (110.0 +/- 70.4 microU x ml(-1)) vs. raisin trial (61.4 +/- 37.4 microU x ml(-1)). After 45 minutes of exercise, insulin decreased to 14.2 +/- 6.2 microU x ml(-1) and 13.3 +/- 18.9 microU x ml(-1) for gel and raisin trials, respectively.
