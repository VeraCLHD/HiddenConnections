In studies in vitro, no significant differences in antiplatelet activity was observed in fresh tomato hybrids. Furthermore, the agro-industrial process did not affect the antiplatelet activity of paste and pomace. Likewise, pomace intake of 1.0â€‰g/kg per day prolonged bleeding time and reduced ex vivo platelet aggregation in rats.
