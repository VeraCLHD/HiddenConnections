RESULTS: The postprandial increase in plasma triacylglycerol was lower [74% and 58% lower incremental area under curve (iAUC)] after the WA meal than after the AO and CO meals (P < 0.001). Increases in plasma glucose concentrations (0-180 min) were significantly higher after the WA meal (iAUC: 114; 95% CI: 76, 153) than after the AO meal (iAUC: 74; 95% CI: 48, 99) (P < 0.05), but no significant differences from the CO meal were observed (iAUC: 88; 95% CI: 66, 109). The peak reductions in peripheral augmentation index after the WA, AO, and CO meals (-9.5%, -10.1%, and -12.6%, respectively, at 2 h) were not significantly different between meals.
