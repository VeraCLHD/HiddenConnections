All groups had similar caloric intakes; however, the CTL group experienced a 4% weight gain compared to baseline (p < 0.05), while both flax groups had constant body weights during the study period. All other parameters, including glycemic control, were unchanged by dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Milled FXS and FXO intake does not affect glycemic control in adults with well-controlled type 2 diabetes.
