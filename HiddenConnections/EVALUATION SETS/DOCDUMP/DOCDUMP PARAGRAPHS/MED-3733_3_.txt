We evaluated the effects of watermelon extract on ankle BP and cAIx in individuals with normal ABI and prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. METHODS: Ankle and brachial systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cAIx, ABI, and heart rate (HR) were evaluated in the supine position in 14 adults (11 women/3 men, age 58 ± 1 years) with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (153 ± 4 mm Hg). Subjects were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of watermelon extract supplementation (L-citrulline/L-arginine, 6 g daily) or placebo followed by a 2-week washout period and then crossover.
