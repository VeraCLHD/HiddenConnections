In addition, the observed mutations were classified according to size and type of mutation per wing. Both chlorexidin and benzidamine-HCl were genotoxic in terms of total mutations per wing at the highest doses. Survival rates of flies used in the experiments were significantly lower than those of the control group, with both mouthwash products showing toxic effects on Drosophila melanogaster larvae.
