OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and characteristics of melanoma in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: We reviewed the case notes and pathology of all patients who developed melanoma within the Oxford Renal Transplant Unit. The clinical details were recorded including date of transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, interval between transplant and melanoma, site of occurrence, history of sun exposure, type of clinician diagnosing the melanoma, history of other skin malignancies and outcome.
