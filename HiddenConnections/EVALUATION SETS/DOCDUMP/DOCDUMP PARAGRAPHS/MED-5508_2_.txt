Four categories of multivitamin use were considered: (1) no supplement use, (2) use of multivitamins only, (3) use of multivitamins with other individual vitamin/mineral supplements, and (4) use of other supplements only. We used logistic regression to calculate multivariate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of taking multivitamin supplements for various lifestyle, clinical and dietary factors. RESULTS: Overall, 36% of men reported current multivitamin use.
