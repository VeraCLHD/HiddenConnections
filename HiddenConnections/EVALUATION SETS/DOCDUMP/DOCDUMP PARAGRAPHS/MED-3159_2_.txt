The unraveling of this metabolic compartmentalization in this complex ecosystem will certainly be a challenge for systems biology and necessary for defining human health at the molecular level. Within the systems biology framework, functional analyses at the level of gene expression (transcriptomics), protein translation (proteomics), and, more recently, the metabolite network (metabolomics) have become increasingly popular. Metabolomics experiments aim to quantify all metabolites in a cellular system (cell or tissue) under defined states and at different time points so that the dynamics of any biotic, abiotic, or genetic perturbation can be accurately assessed.
