Treatment with colloidal oatmeal was applied to 11 patients with a rash induced by cetuximab, erlotinib, panitumumab and sorafenib. Of the 10 assessable patients, 6 had complete response and 4 partial response, giving a response rate of 100% with no associated toxicities. Treatment with colloidal oatmeal lotion is efficient in controlling the rash associated with EGFR and multiple TKI, and allows continuation of the antineoplastic treatment.
