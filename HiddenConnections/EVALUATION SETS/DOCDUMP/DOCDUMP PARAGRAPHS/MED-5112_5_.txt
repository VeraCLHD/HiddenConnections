These results are similar to the previous data obtained for active TGF-beta, and therefore we cannot discount the possibility that anti-gal contributed to the previous data. Following further adjustment for several risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, several anti-carbohydrate antibodies were still significantly different between patients and controls. Therefore, anti-carbohydrate antibodies may represent a new class of risk factors that may be associated with presence of advanced atherosclerosis, although larger studies will be required to confirm this hypothesis.
