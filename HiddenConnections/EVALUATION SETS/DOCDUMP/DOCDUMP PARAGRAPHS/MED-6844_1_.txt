Objective: We estimated the distributions of usual daily sodium and potassium intakes by sociodemographic and health characteristics relative to current recommendations. Design: We used 24-h dietary recalls and other data from 12,581 adults aged ≥20 y who participated in NHANES in 2003–2008. Estimates of sodium and potassium intakes were adjusted for within-individual day-to-day variation by using measurement error models.
