Abstract PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of dietary proteins (casein, soy protein) and skimmed milk on the plasma kinetics of green tea (GT) catechins. METHODS: In a randomized cross-over design with one-week intervals, 24 healthy normal-weight women consumed a test drink containing 1.75 g GT extract with or without the addition of different proteins. Treatments were GT (control), GT with skimmed milk (GT + M), GT with caseinate (GT + CS), or GT with soy protein (GT + S).
