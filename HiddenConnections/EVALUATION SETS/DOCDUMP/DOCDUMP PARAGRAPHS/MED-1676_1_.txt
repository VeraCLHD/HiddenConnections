The validity of the RCT rests not just on theoretical arguments, but also on the discrepancy between the RCT and less rigorous evidence (the difference is sometimes considered an objective measure of bias). A brief overview of historical and recent developments in "the discrepancy argument" is presented. The article then examines the possibility that some of this "deviation from truth" may be the result of artifacts introduced by the masked RCT itself.
