Finally, statin users at both baseline and follow-up demonstrated decreased leg strength (-16.17 kg, 95% CI -30.19 to -2.15) and LMQ (-1.13 kg/kg, 95% CI -2.02 to -0.24) compared to those who had ceased statin use at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Statin use may exacerbate muscle performance declines and falls risk associated with aging without a concomitant decrease in muscle mass, and this effect may be reversible with cessation.
