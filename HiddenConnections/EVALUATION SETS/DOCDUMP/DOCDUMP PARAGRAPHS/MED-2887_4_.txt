Results After multivariable adjustment, the highest quartile of Western pattern score compared to the lowest quartile was directly associated with microalbuminuria (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.66; p-for trend=0.01) and rapid eGFR decline of â‰¥3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.03). Women in the top quartile of the DASH score had decreased risk for rapid eGFR decline (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80), but had no association with microalbuminuria. These associations did not vary with diabetes status.
