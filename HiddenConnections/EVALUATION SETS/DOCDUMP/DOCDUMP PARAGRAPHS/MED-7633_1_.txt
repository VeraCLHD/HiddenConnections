The aim of this study was to estimate the cyto- and genotoxicity of mate tea in human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro. We found that yerba mate extract induced a concentration-dependent, statistically significant increase in the level of apoptotic and necrotic cells and a decrease in the nuclear division index (NDI). Mate-exposed lymphocytes had a reduced transcriptional rDNA activity, which may be due to the stress conditions, and showed an elevated production of micronuclei.
