A daily multivitamin was also not significantly associated with total mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88â€“1.02; P=0.13). The effect of a daily multivitamin on major cardiovascular events did not differ between men with or without a baseline history of CVD (P, interaction = 0.62). Conclusions A daily multivitamin did not reduce major cardiovascular events, MI, stroke, and CVD mortality after more than a decade of treatment and follow-up.
