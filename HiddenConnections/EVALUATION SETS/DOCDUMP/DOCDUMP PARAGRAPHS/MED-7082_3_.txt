Endothelial function, in the form of flow-mediated vasoactivity, was assessed in the brachial artery using 7.5-MHz ultrasound as percent arterial diameter change 1 minute after 5 minutes of upper-arm arterial occlusion. Serum lipoproteins and glucose were determined before eating and 2 and 4 hours postprandially. Serum triglycerides increased from 94 +/- 55 mg/dl preprandially to 147 +/- 80 mg/dl 2 hours after the high-fat meal (p = 0.05).
