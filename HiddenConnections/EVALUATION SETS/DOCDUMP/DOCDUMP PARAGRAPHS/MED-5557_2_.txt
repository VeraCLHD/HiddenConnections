Therefore, profound investigation into the in-depth molecular mechanisms of drug resistance is essential and may hopefully translate into effective therapies that can flip the switch from drug resistance to susceptibility. Mechanistically, resistance phenomena may be explained by (i) overexpression of drug efflux pumps, (ii) enhanced drug detoxification, (iii) rapid DNA repair efficiency, (iv) defects in apoptosis regulation, and (v) active cell survival signals. Several adverse effects associated with multidrug resistance and the need for safe multi-targeted anticancer drugs instigated the use of the phytochemical, curcumin, the yellow pigment of the spice turmeric, which has pleotropic activities.
