CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of CGJ for 12 weeks did not lead to significant weight gain, but consumption of SGD did. The basis of this differential response could not be documented, but it is hypothesized to be a result of dietary compensation and effects of CGJ polyphenols on thermogenesis and substrate oxidation.
