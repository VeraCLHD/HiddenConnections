On the ALA diet, walnuts, walnut oil, and flax oil provided 17% energy from PUFA (10.5% LA, 6.5% ALA). Results The ALA and LA diets significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (−2 to −3 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance (−4%), and this effect was evident at rest and during stress (main effect of diet, p < 0.02). FMD increased (+34%) on the diet containing additional ALA.
