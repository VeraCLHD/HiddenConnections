After curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue, the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and using light and electron microscopy. RESULTS All vascular structures ≥ 8μm in diameter were preserved. Thoracic and lumbar segmental arteries (SAs) give rise not only to the anterior spinal artery (ASA), but to an extensive paraspinous network feeding the erector spinae, iliopsoas, and associated muscles.
