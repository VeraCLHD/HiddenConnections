Up to now, the concentration of 8-PN in beer was considered too low to affect human health. However, these results show that the activity of the intestinal microbial community could more than 10-fold increase the exposure concentration. Because prenylflavonoids are present in many beers with IX being the major constituent, the results raise the question whether moderate beer consumption might contribute to increased in vivo levels of 8-PN and even influence human health.
