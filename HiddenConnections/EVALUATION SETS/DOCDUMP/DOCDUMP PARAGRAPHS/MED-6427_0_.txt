Abstract Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis have emerged as major complications associated with use of systemic antimicrobials. In this study, the medical records for 18 subjects who received donor stool by nasogastric tube for recurrent C. difficile infection during a 9-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. During the period between the initial diagnosis of C. difficile colitis and the stool treatments, the 18 subjects received a total of 64 courses of antimicrobials (range, 2-7 courses; median, 3 courses).
