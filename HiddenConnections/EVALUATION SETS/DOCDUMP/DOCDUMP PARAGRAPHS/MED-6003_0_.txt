Abstract Aging affects all organisms and its basic mechanisms are expected to be conserved across species. Oxidation of proteins has been proposed to be one of the basic mechanisms linking oxygen radicals with the basic aging process. If oxidative damage to proteins is involved in aging, long-lived animals (which age slowly) should show lower levels of markers of this kind of damage than short-lived ones.
