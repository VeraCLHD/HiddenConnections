Heterocyclic amines are mutagenic and carcinogenic pyrolysis products formed during high temperature cooking of meats. In the present study, human milk samples were analyzed for PhIP, one of the most abundant dietary heterocyclic amine. A protocol was developed with a mixed-mode cation exchange sorbent for the extraction of heterocyclic amines from milk.
