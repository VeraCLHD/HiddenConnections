Physical activity lowered values by 6.3 mmol 路 L(-1) 路 9 h(-1) (95% CI: 1.8, 10.7 mmol 路 L(-1) 路 9 h(-1); P = 0.006) when compared with regular activity breaks. CONCLUSION: Regular activity breaks were more effective than continuous physical activity at decreasing postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in healthy, normal-weight adults. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials registry as ACTRN12610000953033.
