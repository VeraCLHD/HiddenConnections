Abstract The behavior of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is considered in terms of the possibility of having an effective antidepressant that does not give rise to hypertensive interactions with dietary tyramine. Studies with punch-biopsy samples of human intestine and rat intestinal samples show MAO-A to be the predominant form of the enzyme in both species. Transport studies with everted rat intestinal preparations indicate that tyramine is extensively metabolized during transport through the intestine.
