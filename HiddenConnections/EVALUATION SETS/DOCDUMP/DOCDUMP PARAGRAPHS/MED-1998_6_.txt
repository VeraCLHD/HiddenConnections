Evidence would suggest that for many, bereavement results in a time of increased psychological stress and potential for altered behavioural health risk factors that in the presence of altered physiological state, may serve as a potential trigger of cardiovascular events, especially in those most at risk. CONCLUSION: The findings from this review provide insight into the impact of early bereavement on health and the recognition that bereavement is associated with increased cardiac risk. This recognition should provide an impetus for individuals to act on cardiac symptoms by seeking medical advice and for health care providers to monitor such individuals more closely.
