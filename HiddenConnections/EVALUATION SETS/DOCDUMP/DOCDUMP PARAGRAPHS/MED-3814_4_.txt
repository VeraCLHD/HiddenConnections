Coronary arteriography was performed in 10 swine (Yorkshire, 25–35 kg) after power injection of contrast material into the left main coronary artery. A densitometry technique was used to quantify regional flow and lumen volume in vivo after inducing hyperemia. Additionally, 3 swine hearts were casted and imaged post-mortem using cone-beam CT to obtain the lumen volume and the arterial length of corresponding coronary arteries.
