METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors describe a 22-year-old man presenting with rhabdomyolysis approximately 2 weeks after starting a weight-loss dietary supplement. His medical history was significant only for hypertension treated with amlodipine. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was confirmed (creatine kinase, 84,000 IU/L, positive urine myoglobin) with other potential causes ruled out.
