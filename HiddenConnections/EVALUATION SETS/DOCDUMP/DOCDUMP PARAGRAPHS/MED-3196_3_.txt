METHODS: Using an extensive online search, we conducted a meta-analysis of new onset incident/recurrent AF following exposure to fish/fish oil or long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A random-effect model was used and between-studies heterogeneity was estimated with I(2). The quality of studies was assessed using Jadad and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) scoring systems.
