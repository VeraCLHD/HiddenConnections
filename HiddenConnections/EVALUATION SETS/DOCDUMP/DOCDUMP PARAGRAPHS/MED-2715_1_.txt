To establish the relationship between diets high in Cu and Fe and cognitive decline or AD, we have conducted a systematic review of the literature (up to January 2011). We identified two meta-analyses, two systematic reviews, eleven placebo-controlled trials, five observational studies, forty-five case-control studies, thirty autopsy and five uncontrolled studies, and one case report. There were eleven interventional trials that tried to either supplement or deplete Fe and Cu, but none of them provided clear evidence of a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in patients with AD.
