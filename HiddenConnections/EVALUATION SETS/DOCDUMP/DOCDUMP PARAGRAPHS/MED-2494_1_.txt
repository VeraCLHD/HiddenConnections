Although chronic hyperglycaemia is almost certainly involved, it is not known whether the primary pathology is metabolic, microvascular, or an interaction between the two. Hyperglycaemia-induced polyol pathway hyperactivity associated with nerve sorbitol accumulation and myo-inositol depletion may play a part in the genesis of diabetic neuropathy. The case for microvascular disease in diabetic neuropathy is now strong.
