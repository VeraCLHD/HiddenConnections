Abstract In a controlled clinical trial we have recently shown that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improved after fasting for 7-10 d and that the improvement could be sustained through 3.5 months with a vegan diet and 9 months with a lactovegetarian diet. Other studies have indicated that the inflammatory process in RA can be reduced through manipulation of dietary fatty acids. A switch to a vegetarian diet significantly alters the intake of fatty acids.
