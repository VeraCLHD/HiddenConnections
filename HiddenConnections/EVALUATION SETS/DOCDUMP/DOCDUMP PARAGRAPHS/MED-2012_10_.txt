No events in the diary (use of personal care products, e.g.) appear associated with exposures. On day 2, non-dietary sources may still be present, such as from dust. Another hypothesis is that small reservoirs of BPA from past exposures are released from storage (lipid reservoirs, e.g.) and excreted.
