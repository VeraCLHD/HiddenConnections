INTERVENTION: Experimental subjects viewed a humorous video while subjects in the distraction control group viewed a tourism video. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported stress and arousal (Stress Arousal Check List), mirthful laughter (Humor Response Scale), and immune function (chromium release natural killer [NK] cell cytotoxicity assay). RESULTS: Stress decreased for subjects in the humor group, compared with those in the distraction group (U32 = 215.5; P = .004).
