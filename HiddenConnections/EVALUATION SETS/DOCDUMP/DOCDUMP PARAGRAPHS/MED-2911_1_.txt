While the Eskimos living in Denmark did not differ substantially from other persons living in Denmark and, from what is found in other studies in Western communities, the Greenland Eskimos showed a completely different pattern. They demonstrated a much higher proportion of palmitic, palmitoleic, and timnodonic acids, while they had a markedly lower concentration of linoleic acid. The total concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower in Greenland Eskimos than in the other groups.
