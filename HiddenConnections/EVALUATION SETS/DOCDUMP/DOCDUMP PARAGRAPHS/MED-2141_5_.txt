Risk of hip fracture was reduced (odds ratios were below 1.0) in individuals below age 90 years. In individuals with vs without cutaneous malignant melanoma, corresponding odds ratios were 0.79 (0.74-0.84) for myocardial infarction and 0.84 (0.76-0.93) for hip fracture, and the corresponding hazard ratio for death from any cause was 0.89 (0.87-0.91); however, cutaneous malignant melanoma was associated positively with death from any cause in some individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, having a diagnosis of skin cancer was associated with less myocardial infarction, less hip fracture in those below age 90 years and less death from any cause.
