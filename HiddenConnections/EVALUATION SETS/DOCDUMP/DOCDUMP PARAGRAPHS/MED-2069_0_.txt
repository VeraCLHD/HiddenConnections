Abstract The idea that alcoholic beverages might contain biologically active phytoestrogenic congeners stemmed from findings of overt feminization observed in alcoholic men with alcohol-induced cirrhosis. Specifically, in addition to being hypogonadal, these chronically alcohol-abusing men with cirrhosis frequently manifest gynecomastia, palmar erythema, spider angiomata, and a female escutcheon. These physical signs of exposure to active estrogen occur in the presence of normal or only minimally elevated levels of endogenous steroid estrogens.
