Abstract OBJECTIVE: This study will determine if the selective use of attractive names can be a sustainable, scalable means to increase the selection of vegetables in school lunchrooms. METHODS: Study 1 paired an attractive name with carrots in five elementary schools (n=147) and measured selection and consumption over a week compared to controls. Study 2 tracked food sales of vegetables in two elementary schools (n=1017) that were systematically attractively named or not named over a two-month period.
