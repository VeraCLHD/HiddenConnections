The interactions of several identified proteins with Ca2+/CaM were confirmed by using pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Many of the CaM-binding proteins identified belong to protein families such as the DEAD/H box proteins, ribosomal proteins, proteasome 26S subunits, and deubiquitinating enzymes, suggesting the possible involvement of Ca2+/CaM in different signaling pathways. The selection method described herein could be used to identify the binding partners of other calcium sensors on the proteome-wide scale.
