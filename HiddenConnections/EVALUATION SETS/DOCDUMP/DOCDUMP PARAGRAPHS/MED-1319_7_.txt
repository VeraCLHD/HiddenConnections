There were no significant differences, however, for the subset of controls with primary brain tumors (4.7% vs 3.5%), a condition that has also been associated with neurocysticercosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is a relationship between calcified neurocysticercosis and primary headache disorders. It is possible that periodic remodeling of cysticercotic calcifications, with liberation of antigens to the brain parenchyma, contributes to the occurrence of headache in these patients.
