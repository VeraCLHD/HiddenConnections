RESULTS: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was significantly lower after 4 wk consumption of orange juice or CDH than after consumption of CDP (P = 0.02), whereas microvascular endothelium-related reactivity was not significantly affected when measured after an overnight fast. However, both orange juice and CDH ingestion significantly improved postprandial microvascular endothelial reactivity compared with CDP (P < 0.05) when measured at the peak of plasma hesperetin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy, middle-aged, moderately overweight men, orange juice decreases DBP when regularly consumed and postprandially increases endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity.
