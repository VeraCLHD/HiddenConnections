During the second 4-week Program B (intervention), participants consumed a modified elimination diet and a phytonutrient-rich medical food. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, both programs showed trends toward lower mean FIQ total score, MSQ total score, and FibroQuest total score, FIQ stiffness score, and FibroQuest headaches score. Compared to Program A, Program B resulted in a significant decrease (P< .05) in the FIQpain score and stiffness score.
