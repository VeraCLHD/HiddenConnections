After adjustment for confounders, anxiety symptoms were related to dynamic PSV (Adj. r = -0.154, P < 0.05) but not to flaccid PSV. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that flow in the cavernosal arteries can be routinely evaluated by PCDU in the flaccid state. Performing PCDU only in the flaccid state allows identifying subjects with pathological dynamic PSV with accuracy higher than 80%.
