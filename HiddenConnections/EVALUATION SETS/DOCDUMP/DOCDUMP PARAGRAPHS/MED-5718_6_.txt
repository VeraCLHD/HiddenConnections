Furthermore, incubation of mononuclear cells in vitro with 50 mmol/l of the flavonoids hesperetin or naringenin reduced ROS generation by 52 +/- 7% and 77 +/- 8% (P < 0.01), respectively, while fructose or ascorbic acid did not cause any change. CONCLUSIONS: Caloric intake in the form of orange juice or fructose does not induce either oxidative or inflammatory stress, possibly due to its flavonoids content and might, therefore, represent a potentially safe energy source.
