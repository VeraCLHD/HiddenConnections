The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of phenolic compounds present in aqueous, ethyl acetate, and chloroform extracts of H. sabdariffa against mutagenicity of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and also the antiproliferative effect of these extracts. Inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA fragmentation were tested on transformed human HeLa cells. The hot aqueous extract (HAE) contained 22.27 +/- 2.52 mg of protocatechuic acid (PCA) per gram of lyophilized dried extract, and was not statistically different from the cold aqueous or chloroform extracts; the ethyl acetate extract produced the least amount of PCA.
