METHOD: Fifty enamel slabs were divided into five groups which were allocated to the sample solutions groups: Innocent(®) smoothie strawberries and bananas (SB), Innocent(®) smoothie mangoes and passion fruit (MP) and Diet Coke. Distilled deionised water (DD) was used as negative control and citric acid 0.3% as positive control. All the slabs were subjected to a 21-day pH cycling regime involving 2 min of immersions, five times a day with appropriate remineralization periods in between.
