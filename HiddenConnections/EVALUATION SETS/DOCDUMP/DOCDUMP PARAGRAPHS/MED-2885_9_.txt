Compared to individuals with no unhealthy lifestyle-related factors (poor diet quality, current smoking and obesity), adjusted odds of incident microalbuminuria were 131%, 273%, and 634% higher for presence of 1 (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3–4.3), 2 (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.8–7.7), and 3 (OR, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.1–26.1) unhealthy lifestyle-related factors. Limitations Self-reported dietary history and physical activity, low number of outcomes. Conclusions Consuming an unhealthy diet and obesity are associated with incident microalbuminuria.
