Glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), and normalized percent of α-linolenic fatty acid (ALA) were significantly different by treatment (multiple analysis of variance, P = .036, P = .013, P = .008, P = .024 respectively). Paired t tests showed glucose decreased on the 13 g intervention compared to the 0 g period [13 g = -2.10 ± 1.66 mg/L (mean ± SEM), 0 g = 9.22 ± 4.44 mg/L, P = .036]. Insulin decreased on the 13 g intervention but not the 26 g (P = .021) and 0 g (P = .013) periods (13 g = -2.12 ± 1.00 mU/L, 26 g = 0.67 ± 0.84 mU/L, 0 g = 1.20 ± 1.16 mU/L).
