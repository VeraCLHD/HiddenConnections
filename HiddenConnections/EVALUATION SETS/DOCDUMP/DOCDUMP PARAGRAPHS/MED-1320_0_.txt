Abstract Recent studies suggest that neurocysticercosis may be a risk factor for human cancer. Pathogenetic mechanisms explaining possible oncogenic effects of cysticerci include the following: (a) parasite-induced modulation of the host immune response that may be associated with loss of regulatory mechanisms implicated in the immunological surveillance against cancer; (b) transfer of genetic material from the parasite to the host, causing DNA damage and malignant transformation of host cells, and (c) chronic inflammation with liberation of nitric oxide and inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. Further research is needed to confirm the potential role of cysticercosis in the development of cancer.
