One of the individuals had an extraordinary pre-fast exposure event with concentrations rising as high as 98 μg/g creatine but declining to <5 μg/g creatine by day 2. Given patterns found in day 1 and the subsequent decline to lower levels in day 2, we hypothesize that BPA exposures in these individuals were diet-driven. No events in the diary (use of personal care products, e.g.) appear associated with exposures.
