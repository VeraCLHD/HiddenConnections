Coronary blood flow was evaluated in the distal LAD by using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after food intake. In the CBF curve, the time velocity integral of diastolic flow (Dtvi) and the product of Dtvi and heart rate (HR) were measured. In six patients, these measurements were repeated after successful coronary intervention.
