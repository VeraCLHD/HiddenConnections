Insulin sensitivity (%S) and beta-cell function (%B) were determined using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). IMCL levels were determined using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy; total body fat content was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in sex, age, BMI, waist measurement, percentage body fat, activity levels and energy intake.
