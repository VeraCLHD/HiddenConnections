Plasma phospholipid omega-3 concentrations showed a similar directionality of association with brachial artery measures observed for nonfried fish consumption, although statistical significance was not achieved in fully adjusted models. Conclusion: This study indicates that the association between nonfried fish intake and baseline brachial artery size varies by sex, with suggestive evidence of sex differences in the association between nonfried fish intake and FMD.
