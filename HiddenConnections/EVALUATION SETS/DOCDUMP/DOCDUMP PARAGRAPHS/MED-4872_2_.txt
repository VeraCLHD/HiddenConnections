On the 1992 follow-up questionnaire, participants were asked whether they had ever used “tetracycline for at least two months at a time (e.g., for acne or other reason)” and their duration of use. Prostate cancer diagnoses were ascertained on each subsequent biennial questionnaire and confirmed by medical record review. Between 1992 and 2002, 2,147 cases of prostate cancer were reported among 34,629 eligible participants.
