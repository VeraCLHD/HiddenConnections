At diagnosis, age- and sex-adjusted serum concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, zinc, and alpha-tocopherol were significantly inversely associated with cancer. No significant decreases in mean values were observed at 6 month, except for the alpha-tocopherol-to-cholesterol ratio in patients with bone tumors and serum zinc in bone tumors and central nervous system malignancies. An increase during the period of treatment was found for retinol and selenium in leukemia patients.
