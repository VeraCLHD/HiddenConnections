Abstract BACKGROUND: A very-low-energy diet (VLED) can result in substantial, rapid weight loss and is increasingly prescribed before obesity surgery to minimize risk and difficulty by reducing liver size and abdominal adiposity. Despite its growing popularity, a VLED in this setting has received little attention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and acceptability of a preoperative VLED.
