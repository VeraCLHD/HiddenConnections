Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Approximately 10% of the millions of persons with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGDs) including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) had their illness onset following an acute bout of infectious diarrhea and are referred to as having postinfectious (PI) FGD or PI-IBS. Recent studies have helped to identify the pathogenesis and natural history of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Groups of patients with acute diarrhea or dysentery (passage of grossly bloody stools) are being followed for development of PI-IBS.
