Although DAB oxidation can also detect peroxidase activity, this was inactivated by H2O2 pretreatment before use of DAB, as shown by a specific peroxidase detection method. Model studies confirmed the ability of certain copper and iron coordination complexes to catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of DAB. Also, the microtubule-associated protein tau, as an in vitro model for proteins relevant to AD pathology, was found capable of adventitious binding of copper and iron in a redox-competent manner.
