Tests for linear trend in adjusted mean BMD of the hip and lumbar spine were performed across energy adjusted NEAP and PRAL quartiles. Modification by calcium intake (dietary or total) above or below 800 mg/d was assessed by interaction terms. Overall, mean age was 69 Â± 0.3y. Among women, there was no association between NEAP and BMD.
