RESULTS: Juice consumption resulted in relatively fast responses in plasma carotenoid concentrations (p < 0.0002) which were not accompanied by concomitant changes in immune functions. For IL-2, NK cell cytotoxicity, and lymphocyte proliferation, maximum responses were observed during depletion periods. The highest production rate was measured only for TNFalpha at the end of the first intervention period.
