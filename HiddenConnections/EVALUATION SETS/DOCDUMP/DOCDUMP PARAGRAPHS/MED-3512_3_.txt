Mean serum total cholesterol was very low among both men (123 mg/dl) and women (142 mg/dl) compared with western samples, whereas triglycerides--112 and 110 mg/dl, respectively--were lower among men and slightly higher among women than for U.S. men and women. Yanomamo women had significantly higher total cholesterol (P = 0.02) and body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.05) than men. HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.08) and LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.21) were also somewhat higher among women.
