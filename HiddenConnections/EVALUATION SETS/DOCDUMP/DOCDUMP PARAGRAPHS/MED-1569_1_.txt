Hydrophilic antioxidant activity (HAA) and lipophilic antioxidant activity (LAA) were measured using the ABTS/H₂O₂/HRP decoloration method. HAA and LAA were then summed to calculate the total antioxidant activity (TAA). Mean differences in HAA and LAA were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's T3 pairwise comparisons.
