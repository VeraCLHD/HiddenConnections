Recently, three different PGE synthases have been identified, that convert COX-2 metabolites into PGE2. mPGE synthase (mPGES)-1 has been shown to be inducible, and to colocalize with COX-2 in fibroblasts and macrophages infiltrating the gastric ulcer bed. cPGES and mPGES-2 have been found expressed in normal gastric mucosa, with no change in expression levels seen in gastritis or gastric ulcer tissue.
