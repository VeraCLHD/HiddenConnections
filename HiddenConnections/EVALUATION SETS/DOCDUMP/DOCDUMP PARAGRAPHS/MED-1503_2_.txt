In this study, we applied a free-living, self-controlled diet design. Twenty-four subjects (2 males, 22 females) 20 to 55 years of age consumed 2 kiwifruits 1 hour before bedtime nightly for 4 weeks. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI), a 3-day sleep diary, and the Actigraph sleep/activity logger watch were used to assess the subjective and objective parameters of sleep quality, including time to bed, time of sleep onset, waking time after sleep onset, time of getting up, total sleep time, and self-reported sleep quality and sleep onset latency, waking time after sleep onset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency before and after the intervention.
