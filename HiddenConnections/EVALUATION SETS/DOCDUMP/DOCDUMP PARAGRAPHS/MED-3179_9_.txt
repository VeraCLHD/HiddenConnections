Plasma arginine concentrations, the arginine-to-lysine ratio, and plasma isoflavone concentrations were higher after ISP consumption (P < 0.05). Urinary albumin excretion was negatively correlated with plasma total isoflavones (rho = -0.441), daidzein (rho = -0.326), and O-desmethylangolesin (rho = -0.389) (P < 0.05). The findings indicate that isolated soy protein consumption improves several markers that may be beneficial for type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.
