Abstract n-Butyrate inhibits the growth of colon cancer cell lines. In the HCT 116 cell line, butyrate-induced growth inhibition is almost fully reversible, whereas in the VACO 5 cell line, a subpopulation undergoes apoptosis within 30 hr of treatment with butyrate. Concurrent treatment of VACO 5 cells with butyrate and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) accelerates and increases the incidence of cell death to nearly 100% of the population, whereas HCT 116 cells largely remain alive during treatment with this combination.
