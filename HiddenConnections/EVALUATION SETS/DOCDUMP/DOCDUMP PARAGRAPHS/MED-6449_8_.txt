Results Confirming earlier phase I data, none of the 27 participants developed FBR gel – associated toxicities. Furthermore, our results show histologic regression in a subset of patients as well as statistically significant reduction in LOH at tumor suppressor gene – associated loci. Conclusions These preliminary data suggest that further evaluation of berry gels for oral IEN chemoprevention is warranted.
