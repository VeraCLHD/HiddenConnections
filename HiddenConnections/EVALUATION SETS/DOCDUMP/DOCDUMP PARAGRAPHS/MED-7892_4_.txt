Two matched controls for each patient were selected from the cohort. Isoflavone levels were assessed by plasma level and food frequency questionnaire, and the odds ratio of breast cancer according to isoflavone level was estimated using a conditional logistic regression model. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant inverse association between plasma genistein and risk of breast cancer, but no association for plasma daidzein.
