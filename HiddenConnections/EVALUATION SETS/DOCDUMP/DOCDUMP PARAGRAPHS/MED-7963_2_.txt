Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of nutrients with endometrial cancer risk using an energy density method (e.g., nutrient intake/1,000 kilocalories of intake). Higher energy intake was associated with increased risk, which was attributable to animal source energy and a high proportion of energy from protein and fat. Odds ratios comparing highest versus lowest quintiles of intake were elevated for intake of animal protein (Odds ratio (OR) 5 2.0, 95% confidential interval: 1.5–2.7) and fat (OR 5 1.5, 1.2–2.0), but reduced for plant sources of these nutrients (OR 5 0.7, 0.5–0.9 for protein and OR 5 0.6, 0.5–0.8 for fat).
