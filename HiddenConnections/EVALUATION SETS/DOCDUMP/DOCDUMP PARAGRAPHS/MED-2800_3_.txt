SUBJECTS: A total of 986 birth defects cases, 990 frequency-matched live birth controls, and 159 stillbirth controls. RESULTS: Modestly elevated risk of birth defects was identified among women who reported having a cold with or without fever in the first trimester of pregnancy. Notably increased relative risks were observed for anencephalus (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 7.7), spina bifida (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.7 to 9.7), hydrocephalus (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.1), cleft lip (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.4), and undescended testicle (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.0).
