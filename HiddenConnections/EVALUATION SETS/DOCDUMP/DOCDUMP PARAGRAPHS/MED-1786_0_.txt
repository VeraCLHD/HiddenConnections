Abstract In vitro, experimental, and clinical work suggests that metabolic acidosis, either directly or indirectly, can promote the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Goraya et al. demonstrate that both oral alkali supplementation and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables are equally effective at decreasing urinary excretion of markers of renal injury in patients with stage 2 CKD. Although this study is promising, the short duration and use of only urinary markers as a surrogate outcome weaken the conclusions.
