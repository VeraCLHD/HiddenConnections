These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of Avns on colon cancer cell proliferation may be independent of COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production. Thus, Avns might reduce colon cancer risk through inhibition of macrophage PGE(2) production and non-COX-related antiproliferative effects in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, Avns had no effect on cell viability of confluence-induced differentiated Caco-2 cells, which display the characteristics of normal colonic epithelial cells.
