We included any study in which investigators randomized hypertensive or normotensive people to calcium supplementation or alternative therapy and measured blood pressure for at least 2 weeks. In addition to 32 trials included in the prior metaanalysis, 10 new trials contributed to this metaanalysis. Two pairs of independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed the validity of the study data according to six quality criteria.
