Eubacterium limosum was identified to be capable of this conversion (O-demethylation) of IX into 8-PN, and after strain selection, a conversion efficiency of 90% was achieved. Finally, strain supplementation to a nonconverting fecal sample led to rapid and high 8-PN production at only 1% (v/v) addition. Up to now, the concentration of 8-PN in beer was considered too low to affect human health.
