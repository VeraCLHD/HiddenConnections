Abstract BACKGROUND: Exposure to over-the-counter (OTC) ibuprofen and other OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is substantial. Although the literature on gastrointestinal (GI) safety of NSAID therapy is extensive, the risk profiles of OTC and prescription dosing are seldom separated, and few studies provide risks specific to OTC ibuprofen. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a literature review to evaluate the risk of GI bleeding events related to OTC ibuprofen use.
