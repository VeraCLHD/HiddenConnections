For a typical study participant, sperm concentrations were 34.7 × 106/mL and 51.6 × 106/mL at the 25th and 75th percentiles of (adjusted) AGDAS. Conclusions: In our population, AGDAS was a strong correlate of all semen parameters and a predictor of low sperm concentration. In animals, male AGD at birth reflects androgen levels during the masculinization programming window and predicts adult AGD and reproductive function.
