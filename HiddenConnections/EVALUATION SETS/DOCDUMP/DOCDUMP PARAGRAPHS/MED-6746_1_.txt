Epidemiological studies suggest that severe periodontal disease is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk, but the mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed flow-mediated dilation and nitroglycerin-mediated dilation of the brachial artery using vascular ultrasound in 26 subjects with advanced periodontal disease and 29 control subjects. The groups were matched for age and sex, and patients with hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and history of cigarette smoking were excluded.
