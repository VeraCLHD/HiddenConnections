Abstract Increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is a key lifestyle modification in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Kiwifruit has previously been shown to have favorable effects on blood pressure (BP), likely through inhibiting angiotensin I-converting enzyme activity. We hypothesized that the replacement of 2 fruit servings in a healthy diet with 2 green kiwifruit a day would significantly improve BP and other markers of cardiovascular function, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance, in a group of hypercholesterolemic men.
