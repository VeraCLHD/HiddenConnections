Serum adiponectin concentration after an oral glucose tolerance test and after ingestion of a standardised mixed, fat-containing meal in 110 male non-diabetic subjects was assessed. Fasting and postprandial adiponectin and the decrease of adiponectin were correlated with anthropometric and metabolic parameters. Subjects were genotyped for adiponectin - 11 388 G/A promoter single nucleotide polymorphism.
