Among the spinach groups no significant differences were detected. However, the plasma folate response of the pooled minced and liquefied spinach groups was greater than that of the whole-leaf spinach group (p = 0.03). Re-addition of dietary fibre to the liquefied spinach to compensate for the fibre broken down during liquefaction did not reduce the plasma folate response.
