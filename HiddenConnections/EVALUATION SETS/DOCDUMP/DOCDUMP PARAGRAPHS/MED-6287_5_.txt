Furthermore, fisetin inhibited capillary-like tube formation on Matrigel (up to 85%, P < 0.001) as well as migration (up to 66%, P < 0.001), which were associated with decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and VEGF in HUVEC. It also decreased the expression of eNOS, VEGF, inducible nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in A549 and DU145 human cancer cells. In vivo matrigel plug assay in mice showed significant decrease in size (up to 43%, P < 0.001), vascularization and hemoglobin content (up to 94%, P < 0.001) in the plugs from fisetin-treated, compared with control mice.
