In meta-analyses, we report inverse associations for green tea intake and risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.80), and for green tea and risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98). There was no association for black tea and ovarian cancer risk (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.02) and a positive association with endometrial cancer risk (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.38). We summarized the experimental evidence supporting the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of green tea catechins, and results from randomized clinical trials that demonstrated green tea catechin efficacy on treatment of cervical lesions and external genital warts.
