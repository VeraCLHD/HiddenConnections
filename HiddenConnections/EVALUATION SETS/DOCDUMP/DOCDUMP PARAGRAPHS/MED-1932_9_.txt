Although a cross-sectional analysis showed that SMI did not differ with age in women, leg extension power per leg muscle mass and grip strength per arm muscle mass as indices of muscle quality were significantly lower in older women (P for trend, <0.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Age-related decreases in muscle mass were trivial, especially in women, but the quality of muscle decreased with aging in both sexes. Â© 2014 Japan Geriatrics Society.
