The authors discuss how cholesterol might modulate Abeta deposit formation. As neurons receive only small amounts of exogenous cholesterol, statins that efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier may reduce the amount of neuronal cholesterol below a critical level. Decreased neuronal cholesterol levels inhibit the Abeta-forming amyloidogenic pathway possibly by removing APP from cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains.
