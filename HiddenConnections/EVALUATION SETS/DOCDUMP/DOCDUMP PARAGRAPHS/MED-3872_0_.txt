Abstract Molecular mimicry between streptococci and heart components has been proposed as the triggering factor leading to autoimmunity in rheumatic heart disease (RHD). In this review, we present data from cellular autoimmune responses, focusing on the interactions between HLA class II molecules, streptococcal peptides and heart tissue proteins and T-cell receptor (TCR) usage. HLA-DR7DR53 associated with DQ molecules seem to be related with the development of valvular lesions in severe RHD patients.
