Volunteers were rehydrated between 08:00 and 11:00 h. T(osm) was assessed using the TearLab osmolarity system. RESULTS: P(osm) and USG increased with progressive dehydration on FR (P < 0.001). T(osm) increased significantly on FR from 293 ± 9 to 305 ± 13 mOsm·L(-1) at 3% BML and remained elevated overnight (304 ± 14 mOsm·L(-1); P < 0.001).
