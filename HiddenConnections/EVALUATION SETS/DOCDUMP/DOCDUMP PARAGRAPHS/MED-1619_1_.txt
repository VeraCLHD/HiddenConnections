During these trials, plasma glucose declined from 5.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.1 mM (P less than 0.001) and respiratory exchange ratio (R) fell from 0.87 +/- 0.01 to 0.81 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001). After resting 20 min the subjects attempted to continue exercise either 1) after ingesting a placebo, 2) after ingesting glucose polymers (3 g/kg), or 3) when glucose was infused intravenously ("euglycemic clamp"). Placebo ingestion did not restore euglycemia or R. Plasma glucose increased (P less than 0.001) initially to approximately 5 mM and R rose (P less than 0.001) to approximately 0.83 with glucose infusion or carbohydrate ingestion.
