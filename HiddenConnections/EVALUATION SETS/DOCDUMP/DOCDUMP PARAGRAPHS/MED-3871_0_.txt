Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritic and potentially disabling condition, mainly affecting women of middle age and having characteristic clinical features. Various microbial agents were implicated in the causation of RA. Extensive literature based on the results of various genetic, microbiological, molecular, and immunological studies carried out by independent research groups supports the role of Proteus mirabilis bacteria in the etiopathogenesis of RA.
