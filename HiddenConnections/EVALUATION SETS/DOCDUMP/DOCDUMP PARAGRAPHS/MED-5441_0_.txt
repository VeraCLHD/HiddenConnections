Abstract Atherosclerosis may result partly from processes that occur following food consumption and that involve oxidized lipids in chylomicrons. We investigated reactions that could occur in the acidic pH of the stomach and accelerate the generation of lipid hydroperoxides and co-oxidation of dietary constituents. The ability of dietary polyphenols to invert catalysis from pro-oxidation to antioxidation was examined.
