In univariate analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.325; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.659-6.666), current smoking (OR = 3.37; 95 % CI, 1.439-7.881), alcohol consumption (OR = 2.75; 95 % CI, 1.375-5.481), waist circumference (OR = 1.99; 95 % CI, 1.062-3.739), negative for Helicobacter pylori IgG antibody (OR = 1.89; 95 % CI, 1.018-3.491) and non-vegetarianism (OR = 1.99; 95 % CI, 1.062-3.739) were associated with reflux esophagitis. According to multivariate analysis, male sex (OR = 3.44; 95 % CI, 1.698-6.970), non-vegetarianism (OR = 2.08; 95 % CI, 1.086-3.974) and negative H. pylori IgG antibody (OR = 1.96; 95 % CI, 1.039-3.712) were significantly associated with reflux esophagitis. CONCLUSIONS: A non-vegetarian diet is associated with reflux esophagitis.
