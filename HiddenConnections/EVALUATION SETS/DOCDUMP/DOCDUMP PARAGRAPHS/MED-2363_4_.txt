RESULTS: The hazard ratios for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality for each 15 beats/min increase in RHR were 1.24 (1.11-1.40) in men and 1.32 (1.08-1.60) in women, adjusted for age, gender, total cholesterol, physical activity (categorical), SBP, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This relationship remained significant after exclusion of those with comorbidities and events occurring within first 2 years of observation. Relationship with coronary mortality was stronger and with total mortality was slightly weaker.
