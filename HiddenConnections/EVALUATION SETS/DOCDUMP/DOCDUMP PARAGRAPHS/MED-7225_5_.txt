Unique to this review is that it summarizes the extensive network of cofactors and cellular mechanisms that promote NNK-specific lung tumorigenesis. As such, it displays a fuller, more comprehensive overview, bringing us one step closer to understanding the fatal consequences of NNK, thus, discovering new avenues that successfully break the cycle of NNK-mediated lung carcinogenesis.
