We conducted factor analysis using dietary information from a validated food frequency questionnaire to derive dietary patterns. The association between major dietary patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Three major dietary patterns were found: 1) "animal products and fried food," 2) "western," 3) "soybean products and fruit."
