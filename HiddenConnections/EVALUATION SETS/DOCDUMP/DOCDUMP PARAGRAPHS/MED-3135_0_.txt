Abstract AIMS: Isometric arm exercises are able to increase blood pressure during the phase of impending vasovagal syncope. We evaluated their efficacy and feasibility during daily life in a group of 29 consecutive patients affected by vasovagal syncopes. METHODS: The patients were trained to use arm tensing and/or handgrip in case of occurrence of symptoms of impending syncope.
