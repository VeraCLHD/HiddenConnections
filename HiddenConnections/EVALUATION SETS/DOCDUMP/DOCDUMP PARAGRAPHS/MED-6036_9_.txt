CONCLUSION: Antibody levels can be validly used to identify certain job tasks associated with high risk of exposure to REV in the workplace, and the practical implication is recommendations for protection at these job tasks. Importantly, in situations where there is exposure to multiple pathogens in the workplace, the analysis of antibody levels of one pathogen may sufficiently represent exposure to the other correlated pathogens. This suggested exposure assessment may hold true for pathogens with a similar route of transmission.
