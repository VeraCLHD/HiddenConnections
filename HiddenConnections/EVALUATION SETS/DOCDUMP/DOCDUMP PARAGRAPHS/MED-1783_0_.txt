Abstract There is some experimental evidence to suggest that progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) is slower on diets based on soya protein than on diets based on animal protein. We have compared the effect of a soya-based vegetarian low-protein diet (VPD) and an animal-based low-protein diet (APD) in 15 patients with CRF. 15 patients with CRF (51Cr-EDTA-measured glomerular filtration rate 15-50 ml/min/1.73 m2) were studied.
