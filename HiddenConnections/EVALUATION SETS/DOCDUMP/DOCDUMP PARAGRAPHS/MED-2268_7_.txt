Four studies were selected to assess the association between consumption of artificially sweetened soda and CKD. The pooled RR of CKD in patients consuming artificially sweetened soda was 1.33 (95% CI 0.82-2.15). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates statistically significant increased risks of CKD in patients consuming sugar-sweetened soda, but not in patients consuming artificially sweetened soda.
