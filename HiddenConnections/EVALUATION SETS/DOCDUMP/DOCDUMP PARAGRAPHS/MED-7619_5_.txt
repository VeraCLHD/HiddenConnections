After a 15-h challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the mucosal release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured by using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Twenty-seven per cent of the RA patients reported food intolerance (FI) to various foods, and in particular to CM, meat, and wheat gluten. Strong mucosal reactivity to CM was observed in 11% of the patients.
