Available comorbidity data indicate resolution of dyslipidemia, 21 of 30 (70.0%); hypertension, 27 of 36 (75.0%); prehypertension, 15 of 18 (83.3%); symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, 20 of 22 (90.9%); diabetes, 15 of 16 (93.8%); and prediabetes, 11 of 11 (100.0%). CONCLUSIONS: LSG resulted in successful short-term weight loss in more than 90% of pediatric patients and 70% or more comorbidity resolution during up to 24 months of follow-up. Long-term data are necessary to evaluate persistence of weight loss and maturation to adulthood.
