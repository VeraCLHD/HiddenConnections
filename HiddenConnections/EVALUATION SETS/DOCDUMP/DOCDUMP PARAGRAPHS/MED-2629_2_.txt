Completely automated, objective measures of size and severity of perfusion abnormalities on rest-dipyridamole PET images were made by computer algorithm in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. There were statistically significant decreases (improvement) in size and severity of perfusion abnormalities by rest-dipyridamole PET on comparison of baseline control with perfusion abnormalities after intensive 90-day cholesterol lowering and significant increases (worsening) in size and severity after the final control period, respectively, as follows. (1) The percent of left ventricle outside 2.5 SD of normal values on the dipyridamole-to-rest ratio image of normalized counts was 22 +/- 20% after the initial control period, 13 +/- 14% after the treatment period, and 26 +/- 22% after the final control period with a significant decrease (improvement) occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .02) and an increase (worsening) occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .009).
