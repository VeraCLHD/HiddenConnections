In contrast, in the GFD group (Marsh I-II) the symptoms were alleviated, antibody titers decreased, and mucosal inflammation diminished equally to celiac controls (Marsh III). When the trial was completed, all participants chose to continue on a life-long GFD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endomysial antibodies benefit from a GFD regardless of the degree of enteropathy.
