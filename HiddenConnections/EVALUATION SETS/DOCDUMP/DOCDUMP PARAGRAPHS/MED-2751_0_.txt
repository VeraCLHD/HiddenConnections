Abstract This paper provides an overview of the current literature and scientific evidence surrounding inorganic nitrate (NO3−) supplementation and its potential for improving human health and physical performance. As indicative of the ever-expanding organic and natural food consumer market, athletes and health enthusiasts alike are constantly searching for ingredient-specific “super foods” and dietary supplements capable of eliciting health and performance benefits. Evidence suggests that NO3− is the viable active component within beetroot juice (BRJ) and other vegetables, responsible for health-promoting and ergogenic effects.
