In addition, the percentage reduction in systolic (18+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.005) and diastolic (17+/-2 mm Hg; P=0.06) blood pressure was greater with the combination. More patients achieved a blood pressure of <140/90 mm Hg with the combination (60%) than any individual drug (15% to 45%; P<0.05). A low-dose combination of 4 agents representing 4 classes of standard antihypertensive agents was more efficacious than a standard single dose of each agent individually.
