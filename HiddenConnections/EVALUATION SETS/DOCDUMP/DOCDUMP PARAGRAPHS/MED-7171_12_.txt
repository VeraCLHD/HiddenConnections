In clinical studies, aortic calcification was associated with LBP, and stenosis of lumbar arteries was associated with both DD and LBP. In epidemiological studies, smoking and high serum cholesterol levels were found to have the most consistent associations with DD and LBP. CONCLUSION: Aortic atherosclerosis and stenosis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine were associated with DD and LBP.
