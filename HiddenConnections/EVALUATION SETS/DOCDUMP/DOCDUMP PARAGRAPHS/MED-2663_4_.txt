We describe how inflammatory stress accompanying chronic kidney disease modifies lipid homeostasis by increasing cholesterol uptake mediated by lipoprotein receptors, inhibiting cholesterol efflux mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and impairing cholesterol synthesis in peripheral cells. As a result of these events, cholesterol relocates to and accumulates in renal, vascular, hepatic and possibly other tissues. The combination of increased cellular cholesterol influx and reduced efflux causes injury in some tissues and lowers the plasma cholesterol level.
