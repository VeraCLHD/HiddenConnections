Abstract We successfully optimized an analytical method using gel permeation chromatography followed by direct sample introduction comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry to quantify multiple groups of targeted persistent organic pollutants and halogenated natural products (HNPs) simultaneously in fish oil samples. This new method has a wider analytical scope than the traditional approach to use multiple methods to cover each class of compounds. Our analysis revealed that the relatively more volatile and lighter organic compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and other smaller organohalogen compounds, were still present in two brands of "PCB-free" cod liver oils, albeit at much lower levels than in an untreated commercial sample.
