RESULTS: Thirty eight percent of subjects reported rice consumption 2-3 times a week, 58.5% once or less a week, and 3.6% no rice consumption. In subjects who reported rice intake 2-3 times a week, incidence of diabetes after 6 years follow-up was 12.0%, and in those who reported once or less a week, 20.2% (p = 0.04, non adjusted). Subjects who ate rice frequently had lower risk to develop diabetes 6 years later (OR = 0.43, p = 0.04; adjusted for age, sex, obesity, and presence of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline).
