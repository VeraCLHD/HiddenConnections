We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users with statin use as time-dependent variable. A total of 4,151 participants had used statins. During the median follow-up of 3.25 years after the diagnosis (range 0.08â€“9.0 years) 6,011 participants died, of which 3,619 (60.2%) was due to breast cancer.
