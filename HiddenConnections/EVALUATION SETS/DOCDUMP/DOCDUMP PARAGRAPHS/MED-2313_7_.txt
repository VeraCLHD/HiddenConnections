Serum glucose levels also increased in the HCD group, to threefold above the ND group; GS and LL feeding elicited the greatest reduction in hyperglycemia. The groups consuming acai and LL showed much less hepatic inflammation, as well as attenuation of fatty liver and a reduced content of oxidized species. In conclusion, extracts of LL, GS, and acai shared antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic activity in cellular assays and in a hypercholesterolemic zebrafish model.
