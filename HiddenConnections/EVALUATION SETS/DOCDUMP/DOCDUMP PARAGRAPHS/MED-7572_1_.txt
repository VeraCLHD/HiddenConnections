This study aimed to investigate the possible associations between risk factors of non-infectious nature and outbreaks of mortality due to colibacillosis in flocks of caged layer hens. Information on management, biosecurity measures and housing conditions was collected in 20 flocks suffering from the disease and in 20 clinically healthy control flocks. The data were processed using multiple logistic regression.
