A questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, family history, and the frequency of food items consumed. RESULTS: Based on multivariate analysis, a significant association between the risk of MM and family history of cancers in first degree relatives was observed (OR=4.03, 95% CI: 2.50-6.52). Fried food, cured/smoked food, black tea, and fish were not significantly associated with the risk of MM.
