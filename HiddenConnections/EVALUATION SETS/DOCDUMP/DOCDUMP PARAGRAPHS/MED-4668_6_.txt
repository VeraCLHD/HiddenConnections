The RNA region directly following the template can bind complementarily to the newly synthesized telomeric DNA, while the template itself is reused in the telomerase active site during the next reaction cycle. This first structural model of the human telomerase enzyme provides many details of the molecular mechanism of telomerase and immediately provides an important target for rational drug design.
