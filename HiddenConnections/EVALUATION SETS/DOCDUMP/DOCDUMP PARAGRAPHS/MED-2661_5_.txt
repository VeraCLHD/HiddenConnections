MEDLINE was also used to select clinical studies and therapeutic guidelines on SLE therapy. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1 Phase II and 2 Phase III studies that compared belimumab (1, 4, and 10 mg/kg/dose IV on days 0, 14, and 28; then every 28 days) to placebo in patients with active SLE on concurrent therapies. Patients with active lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus were excluded.
