Blood pressure did not differ between groups, and basal heart rate was lower in the two-cup group at baseline and 60 min. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated a significant acute favorable dose-dependent effect of decaffeinated espresso coffee on endothelial function. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of chronic use of DC especially with respect to caffeinated coffee and in subjects with cardiovascular diseases.
