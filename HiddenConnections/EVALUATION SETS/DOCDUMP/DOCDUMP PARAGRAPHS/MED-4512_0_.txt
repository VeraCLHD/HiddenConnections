Abstract We studied 19 male patients with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia, a control group of 28 healthy men and 44 infertile males before any treatment was undertaken. Spermiogram, seminal biochemical studies, measurements of plasma hormone levels and lipid determinations were carried out. Most hyperlipoproteinaemic patients showed abnormalities in the spermiograms and the mean values were lower than in the controls except for semen volume.
