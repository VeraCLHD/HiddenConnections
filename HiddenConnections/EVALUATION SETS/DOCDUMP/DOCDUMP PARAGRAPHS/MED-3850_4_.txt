The ORs were higher among workers with longer duration of exposure. An increased risk among workers exposed to beef meat was mainly apparent for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR 1.49, 95%CI 0.96-2.33), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.78-2.34) and multiple myeloma (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.67-2.94). The latter 2 types were also associated with exposure to chicken meat (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.37, and OR 2.05, 95%CI 1.14-3.69).
