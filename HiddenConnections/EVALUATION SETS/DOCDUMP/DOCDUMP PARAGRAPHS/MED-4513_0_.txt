Abstract Objective To examine the relationship between dairy food intake and semen parameters Design Longitudinal study Setting Men attending academic medical center fertility clinic in Boston, MA Patients 155 men Interventions None Main Outcome Measures total sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive motility, and morphology Results Low-fat dairy intake was positively related to sperm concentration and progressive motility. On average, men in the highest quartile of intake (1.22–3.54 servings/day) had 33% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1, 55) higher sperm concentration and 9.3 (95%CI 1.4, 17.2) percentage units higher sperm motility than men in the lowest quartile of intake (≤0.28 servings/day). These associations were primarily explained by intake of low-fat milk.
