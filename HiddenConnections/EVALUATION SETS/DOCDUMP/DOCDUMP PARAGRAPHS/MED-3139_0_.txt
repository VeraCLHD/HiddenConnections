Abstract BACKGROUND: It is known that approximately two-thirds of patients with vasovagal syncope have prodromal symptoms and when these start, physical maneuvers that can increase venous return may abort the syncopal attack. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of 3 physical maneuvers, squatting, leg-crossing with muscle tensing, and handgrip, on improving hemodynamic status, and to compare the effect of each on aborting or preventing vasovagal syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 50 patients who underwent the head-up tilt test (HUT) to evaluate syncope, 27 patients with positive HUT were classified as group I (14 men, 13 women; mean age 44.5+/-15.3 years), 23 patients with negative HUT were classified as group II (13 men, 10 women; mean age 41.2 +/-16.7 years), and 21 normal subjects were classified as group III (10 men, 11 women; mean age 28.6+/-6.3 years).
