Low dose (100 nM) mixtures of the compounds were ineffective except for a combination of the three isoflavones that induced a significant inhibition of mRNA(arom). The changes in aromatase activity paralleled the mRNA(arom) results and additional studies showed that the reduction in aromatase activity was significantly delayed in time compared with the reduction in mRNA(arom.) This is the first study to compare the action of various phytoestrogens, either singly or in low-dose combination, on the expression and activity of aromatase in human cells and it suggests that chronic dietary exposure and tissue accumulation of low-dose mixtures of phytoestrogens could have important consequences for aromatase activity and the production of oestrogens.
