Abstract The genetic alterations in colorectal cancer progression are determined by one of two separate and distinct underlying pathways of genomic instability. The first pathway, chromosomal instability, is characterized by allelic losses and aneuploidy. The second pathway, microsatellite instability, is characterized by an abundance of subtle DNA mutations and diploidy.
