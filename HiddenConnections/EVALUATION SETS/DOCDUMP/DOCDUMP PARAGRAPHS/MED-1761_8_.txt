CONCLUSION: Higher 25(OH)D levels (>75nmol/L) were associated with significantly reduced mortality in patients with colorectal and breast cancer. Randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation can improve survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients with low vitamin D status (25(OH)D<50nmol/L) at diagnosis and before treatment.
