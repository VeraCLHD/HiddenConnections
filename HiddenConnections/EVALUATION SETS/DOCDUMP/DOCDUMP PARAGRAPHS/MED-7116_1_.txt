METHODS: Twelve health food stores were selected for the study. One investigator approached an employee in each store and asked what they recommended for depression plus five additional questions regarding product use. Thirteen products containing St. John's wort were purchased and analyzed for hypericin and pseudohypericin content using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
