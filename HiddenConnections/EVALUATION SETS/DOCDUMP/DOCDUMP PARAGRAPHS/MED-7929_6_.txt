Total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio (p < 0.05) were lower in smokers. Hypercholesterolemics presented higher uric acid (p < 0.05) but no enzyme activities or substrate concentrations were different from those of normocholesterolemics. CONCLUSIONS: The WM tested appears to be a functional food as it improved the antioxidant status of increased CHD-risk volunteers.
