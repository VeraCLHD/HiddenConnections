Pretreatment with either topical ipratropium bromide, systemic dexchlorpheniramine or indomethacin did not influence the effects induced by capsaicin. Topical pretreatment with lidocaine inhibited the painful sensation but failed to block the rhinorrhea. Desensitization to the effects of capsaicin occurred following 4-5 subsequent applications, and full recovery was observed within 30-40 days.
