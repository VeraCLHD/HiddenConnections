The main outcomes were the prevalence of specific types of industry relationships, the relation between industry sponsorship and study outcome or investigator behavior, and the process for disclosure, review, and management of financial conflicts of interest.

Eight articles, which together evaluated 1140 original studies, assessed the relation between industry sponsorship and outcome in original research.
