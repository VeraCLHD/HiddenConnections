Abstract Purpose of review This article reviews the AAP’s statement on early nutritional interventions on the development of atopic disease in infants and children. Recent findings Recent findings suggest that restriction of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation does not play a major role in the development of allergic disease. In high risk infants exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months prevents or delays atopic dermatitis, cow milk allergy, and wheezing early in life.
