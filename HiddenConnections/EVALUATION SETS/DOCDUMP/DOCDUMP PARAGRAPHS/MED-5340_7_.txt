These results were particularly strong in patients with the MS (Q1 = 1.82 (sd 0.32) v. Q4 = 1.61 (sd 027); P= 0.021) and T2D (Q1 = 1.78 (sd 0.31) v. Q4 = 1.62 (sd 0.35); P= 0.011). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that individuals in the highest LCDS quartile had a significantly negative coefficient of saRHI, which was independent of confounders (OR -0.85; 95 % CI 0.19, 0.92; P= 0.031). These findings suggest that a dietary pattern characterised by a low amount of carbohydrate, but high amounts of protein and fat, is associated with a poorer small artery vascular reactivity in patients with increased CV risk.
