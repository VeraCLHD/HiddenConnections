Abstract OBJECTIVE: The smoking status of physicians can impact interactions with patients about smoking. The 'Smoking: The Opinions of Physicians' (STOP) survey examined whether an association existed between physician smoking status and beliefs about smoking and cessation and a physician's clinical interactions with patients relevant to smoking cessation, and perceptions of barriers to assisting with quitting. METHODS: General and family practitioners across 16 countries were surveyed via telephone or face-to-face interviews using a convenience-sample methodology.
