We have selected and surveyed this particular class of secondary metabolites, which shares high chemical reactivity with intrinsic biocompatibility and affinity for variety of molecular targets gained through evolution, because their suitability as prospective lead compounds for medicinal chemistry seems high but relatively unexplored. In particular, plant phenolics could be perceived as a natural product library, which contains privileged scaffolds, as evidenced by examples of endogenous phenols, phytochemicals containing aryl hydroxyl groups and phenolic synthetic drugs. It is postulated that application of bio-chemo-informatic tools to such library can be helpful in pulling out new drug candidates as well as in validating ADMET compatibility and suitability of the old ones.
