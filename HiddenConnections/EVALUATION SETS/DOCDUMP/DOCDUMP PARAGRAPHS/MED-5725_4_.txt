We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted relative risks. Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.3 y, 313 new cases of T2D occurred. Crude incidence rates of T2D were 7.39, 6.83, 7.00, 6.72, and 12.20 per 1000 person-years in people who reported egg consumption of never, <1 egg/mo, 1–3 eggs/mo, 1–4 eggs/wk, and almost daily, respectively.
