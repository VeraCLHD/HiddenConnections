Abstract Sodium nitrite and formalin have been used as preservatives in the fish meal industry in Norway since 1953. In 1957, fur farms suffered losses of mink due to a new, malignant liver disease. Experimental feeding of herring meal to cows and sheep resulted in the death of some of the animals.
