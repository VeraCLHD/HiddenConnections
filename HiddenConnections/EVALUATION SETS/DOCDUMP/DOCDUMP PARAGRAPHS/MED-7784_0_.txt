Abstract INTRODUCTION: Endothelial dysfunction is known to occur in patients with coronary artery disease. Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive technique for the assessment of endothelial function. The objective of the study was to use the above method to evaluate the pathophysiology of high-fat (HF) intake on endothelial function in a local population.
