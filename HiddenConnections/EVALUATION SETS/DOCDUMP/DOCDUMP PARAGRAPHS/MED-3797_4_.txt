All patients received antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis and remained on study until they were discharged from the PE. The outcomes of principal interest were major infection (pneumonia, bacteremia, or fungemia) and death; if the true probability of either event was 20% on the cooked arm and 40% on the raw arm, then the probability that the cooked arm would be selected as superior was 83%. Results Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to the cooked arm, and 75 were assigned to the raw arm.
