The molecular mechanisms of action of curcumin in treating different types of cancers remain under investigation. The multifaceted role of this dietary agent is mediated through its inhibition of several cell signaling pathways at multiple levels. Curcumin has the ability to inhibit carcinogenicity through the modulation of the cell cycle by binding directly and indirectly to molecular targets including transcription factors (NF-kB, STAT3, Î²-catenin, and AP-1), growth factors (EGF, PDGF, and VEGF), enzymes (COX-2, iNOS, and MMPs), kinases (cyclin D1, CDKs, Akt, PKC, and AMPK), inflammatory cytokines (TNF, MCP, IL-1, and IL-6), upregulation of proapoptotic (Bax, Bad, and Bak) and downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl(2) and Bcl-xL).
