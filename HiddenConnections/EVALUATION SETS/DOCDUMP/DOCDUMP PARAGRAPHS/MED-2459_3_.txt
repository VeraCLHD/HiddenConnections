Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between the changes of glucose and FMD (r = 0.416, P = 0.0018) 2 h after ingestion of saccharose. At 3 h, neither blood glucose nor FMD were different from baseline.
