The duration of butyrate treatment required for chromatin fragmentation (10-20 hr) corresponded to the time required for histone H4 to become predominantly tetraacetylated. Furthermore, trichostatin A, a structurally dissimilar inhibitor of histone deacetylase, mimicked butyrate-induced apoptosis of VACO 5 cells and growth inhibition of HCT 116 cells. The dramatic enhancement of VACO 5 cell death by TPA, and the high level resistance of HCT 116 cells to butyrate were not evident from histone acetylation determinations.
