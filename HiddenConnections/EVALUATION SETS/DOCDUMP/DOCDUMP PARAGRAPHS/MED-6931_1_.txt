The molecules surveyed are potential or proven "desmutagens" or "interceptors." These are biologically prevalent or synthetic molecules that are most often small metabolites proficient in binding to, or reacting with, mutagenic chemicals and free radicals. Many of this class of "blocking agents" are "soft" and "hard" nucleophiles with consequently varying abilities to react with particular classes of electrophiles, the major classes of direct-acting mutagens.
