Design: Participants were 998 healthy women from 2 independent cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; n = 585) and NHS II (n = 413). We computed least-squares mean hormone concentrations across categories of dietary variables, with adjustment for total energy intake, age, and other nondietary factors known to be associated with aMT6s concentrations. Results: In multivariate analyses, we found no significant associations between the intake of various nutrients, including tryptophan and urinary melatonin concentrations.
