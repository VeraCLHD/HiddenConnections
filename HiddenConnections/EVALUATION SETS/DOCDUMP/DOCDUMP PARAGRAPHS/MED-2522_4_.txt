Peonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside also exerted an inhibitory effect on the DNA binding activity and the nuclear translocation of AP-1. Furthermore, these compounds also exerted an inhibitory effect of cell invasion on various cancer cells (SCC-4, Huh-7, and HeLa). Finally, anthocyanins from O. sativa L. indica (OAs) were evidenced by its inhibition on the growth of SKHep-1 cells in vivo.
