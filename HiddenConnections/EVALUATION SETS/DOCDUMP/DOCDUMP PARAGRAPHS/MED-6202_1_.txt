Hesperetin (HN) (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavonone) and hesperetin analogue (HA) were tested for their apoptosis inducing ability. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay revealed a dose as well as duration-dependent reduction of HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma) cellular growth in response to HN and HA treatment. At 24 h 70 μM of HN and 32 μM of HA showed 50% reduction of HT-29 cellular growth.
