A 6-month follow-up was done during which patients in both groups were on SZ or mesalamine. Eight additional patients in the curcumin group and 6 patients in the placebo group relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin seems to be a promising and safe medication for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent UC.
