MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean broccoli intake during 7 weeks of exposure and broccoli liking following exposure. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics were generated. Multilevel models for repeated measures tested effects of condition and bitter sensitivity on mean broccoli intake during exposure and on pre- and post-exposure liking while adjusting for classroom effects and potential covariates.
