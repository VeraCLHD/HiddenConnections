Induced mutations are detected as single mosaic spots on the wing blade of surviving adults that show either the multiple wing hairs or flare phenotype. Induced recombination leads to mwh and flr twin spots and also, to some extent, to mwh single spots. Recording of the frequency and the size of different spots is allowed for a quantitative determination of the mutagenic and recombinogenic effects.
