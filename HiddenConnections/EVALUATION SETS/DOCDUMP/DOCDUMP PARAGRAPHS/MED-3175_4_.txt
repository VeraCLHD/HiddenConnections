Urinary urea nitrogen decreased from 7.5 +/- 1.8 to 3.8 +/- 1.2 g/day (P less than 0.005), according to dietary prescriptions. Creatinine clearance changed from 104.4 +/- 28.7 to 89.3 +/- 16.7 ml/min (n.s.) and no correlation was found with the changes in urinary protein excretion. This data suggest that VSD reduces proteinuria and exerts favourable effects on hypercholesterolaemia.
