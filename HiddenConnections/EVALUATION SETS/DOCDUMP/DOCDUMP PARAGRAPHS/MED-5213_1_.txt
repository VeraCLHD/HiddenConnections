OBJECTIVE: To examine children's total and component diet quality and asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a proxy for asthma severity. METHODS: Food frequency questionnaires adapted from the Nurses' Health Study and supplemented with foods whose nutrients which have garnered interest of late in relation to asthma were administered. From these data, diet quality scores (total and component), based on the Youth Healthy Eating Index (YHEI adapted) were developed.
