Abstract OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerosis of arteries supplying the lumbar region has been suggested as a mechanism leading to intervertebral disc degeneration and sciatica. The study described here examined whether serum lipid levels or pharmacologically treated hyperlipidemia were associated with sciatica. METHODS: A nationally representative sample (n=8028) of Finns aged 30 years or over was interviewed and examined.
