Volume changes from liquid to solid state were measured and timed. Second, thin biological membranes (20-40 microm) were put in the path of growing crystals to determine damage during crystallization. RESULTS: As cholesterol crystallized, the peak volume increased rapidly by up to 45% over 3 min and sharp-tipped crystals cut through and tore membranes.
