These Kupffer cells appeared to process the lipid of dead hepatocytes turning it into activated lipid-laden “foam cells” with numerous small cholesterol-containing droplets. In contrast, hepatocyte lipid droplets in patients and mice with simple steatosis did not exhibit cholesterol crystals and their Kupffer cells did not form crown-like structures or transform into foam cells. Our results suggest that cholesterol crystallization within hepatocyte lipid droplets and aggregation and activation of Kupffer cells in crown-like structures around such droplets represent an important, novel mechanism for progression of simple steatosis to NASH.
