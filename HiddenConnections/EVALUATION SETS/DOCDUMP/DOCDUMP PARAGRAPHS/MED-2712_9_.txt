After treatment with d-penicillamine, the extent of oxidative stress (P < 0.05) was decreased, but no difference was observed in the rate of cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Data from this pilot study suggest that copper could play a role in the production of peroxides in AD, and that d-penicillamine has an effect in reducing oxidative damage, however, results are still inconclusive in terms of drug efficacy on the clinical progression of AD. Studies with larger cohorts are needed to elucidate the real effectiveness of d-penicillamine treatment in AD.
