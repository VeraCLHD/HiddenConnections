Few studies have examined the association between diet and BE. Additional research is needed to confirm the aforementioned association and clarify the mechanisms by which dietary components affect the risk of developing EAC and EGJAC. Future studies could advance our knowledge by emphasizing prospective designs to reduce recall bias, by using validated dietary intake questionnaires and biological measures and by considering important confounders such as gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, tobacco and alcohol use, biometrics, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors.
