The findings of this chemical study strongly suggest that the AAM function helped to modify the aged mouse urine odor so that it more closely resembled the smell of urine from younger mice. Based on the results of the chemical studies, a set of behavioral experiments were therefore conducted. The results of three sets of generalization trials also strongly supported the results of the chemical studies.
