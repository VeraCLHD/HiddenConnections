DESIGN: This was a randomized crossover design in which 29 overweight and obese normotensive men and women followed an LS diet and a US diet for 2 wk. Both diets had similar potassium and saturated fat contents and were designed to ensure weight stability. After each intervention, FMD, pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and blood pressure were measured.
