RESULTS: The opening ratio was significantly higher in the peppermint oil administration group than in the hyoscine-N-butylbromide injection group. The contraction ratio after peppermint oil administration was significantly lower than that after hyoscine-N-butylbromide injection. The time required for disappearance of the antral contraction ring(s) was shorter in the peppermint oil group (97.1 +/- 11.4) than in the hyoscine-N-butylbromide group (185.9 +/- 10.1 s; p < 0.0001).
