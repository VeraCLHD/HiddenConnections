Abstract Basal serum prolactin and serum oestradiol-17-beta concentrations were measured four times during one menstrual cycle in 20 women with severe cyclical mastalgia and normal to slightly fibroadenotic breasts. A group of 10 normal women who had never experienced mastalgia served as controls. Basal serum prolactin was significantly elevated in patients compared to normals, although within the normal range.
