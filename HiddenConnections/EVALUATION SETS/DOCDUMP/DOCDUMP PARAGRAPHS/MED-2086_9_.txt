Change in FMD was related to the urinary sodium: creatinine ratio (r = -0.47, P < 0.05) and was independent of blood pressure. Aldosterone and renin were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: A small reduction in dietary salt intake of 3 g/day improves endothelial function in normotensive overweight and obese subjects.
