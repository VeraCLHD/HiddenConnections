Subjects received one of four treatments: placebo, 60 mg iron, 15 mg manganese, or both mineral supplements daily. Manganese supplementation resulted in significant increases in lymphocyte MnSOD activity and serum manganese concentrations from baseline values but no changes in urinary manganese excretion or in any indices of iron status. Oral contraceptive use and the stage of the menstrual cycle did not confound the use of lymphocyte MnSOD activity or serum manganese to monitor manganese status, but fat intake affected both indices.
