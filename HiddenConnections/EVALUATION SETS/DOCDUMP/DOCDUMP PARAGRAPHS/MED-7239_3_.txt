Agricultural practices play an important part in the concentration of nitrate in both water and vegetables. If nitrate is taken up by the plant and not metabolised to amino acids, proteins or nucleic acids, it is stored in cell vacuoles as a reserve. However, with an over-supply of nitrate relative to possible photosynthesis, this stored nitrate is still present at harvest and leads to high concentrations in plant tissue.
