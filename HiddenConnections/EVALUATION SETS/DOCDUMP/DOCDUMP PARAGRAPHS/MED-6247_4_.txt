Perception thresholds and symptoms were reassessed after 3 months in 15 patients with IBS. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of patients showed altered rectal perception in the form of lowered thresholds for aversive sensations (discomfort), increased intensity of sensations, or altered viscerosomatic referral. Hypersensitivity was found only for aversive sensations in response to rapid phasic distention; stool thresholds and thresholds in response to slow ramp distention were normal.
