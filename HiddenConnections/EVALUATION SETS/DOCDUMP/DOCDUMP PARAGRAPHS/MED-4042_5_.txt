Subjects ingested capsules containing 3 x 0.5 g of highly purified BDG or 3 x 0.5 g of placebo (waxy maize starch) daily. Maintenance of the normal diet of the participants and the correct intake of the capsules were monitored, using 6 x 3-day food recording and counting of the provided capsules. Predefined outcome measures were BDG-induced changes in pro and antiinflammatory markers in circulating blood and gene expression in adipose tissue and peripheral insulin sensitivity expressed as M value.
