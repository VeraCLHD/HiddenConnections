At molecular and cellular levels, L-arginine stimulates expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator 1 (the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis), nitric oxide synthase, heme oxygenase, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. At the whole body level, L-arginine increases blood flow to insulin-sensitive tissues, adipose tissue lipolysis, and the catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, but inhibits fatty acid synthesis and ameliorates oxidative stress, thereby improving metabolic profile. SUMMARY: L-arginine increases mammalian BAT growth and development via mechanisms involving gene expression, nitric oxide signaling, and protein synthesis.
