Abstract PURPOSE: To measure the pH, titratable acidity, fluoride concentration and erosive potential of brewed teas. METHODS: Bag teas were purchased to represent black, green, citrus, fruity, and floral tea flavors from Tulsi, Bigelow, HyVee, Tazo, and Yogi brands and brewed (1 bag/240 ml) in boiling water for 3 minutes. The pH, titratable acidity, and fluoride concentrations were measured.
