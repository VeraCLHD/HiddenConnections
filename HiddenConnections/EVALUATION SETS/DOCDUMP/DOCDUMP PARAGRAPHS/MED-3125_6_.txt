Compared with the control session, the serum phosphate concentration increased after the cheese session (P = 0.004, contrast analysis) and after the milk session (P = 0.02, contrast analysis). Calcium salt (P = 0.007, contrast analysis) and cheese (P = 0.002, contrast analysis) caused a significant decline in serum intact parathyroid hormone compared with the control session. The urinary calcium excretion with cheese was 141% (P = 0.001), with milk was 107% (P = 0.004), and with calcium salt was 75% (P = 0.02) above that of the control session.
