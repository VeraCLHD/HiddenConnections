Significant quantities of γ-oryzanols, including 24-methylenecycloartenol, campesterol, cycloartenol, and β-sitosterol ferulates, were also detected along with lower levels of carotenoids (6.5 μg/g). Red rice was characterized by a high amount of oligomeric procyanidins (0.2 mg/g), which accounted >60% of secondary metabolite content with carotenoids and γ-oryzanol comprising 26.7%, whereas flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins were <9%. Brown and white rice contained lower quantities of phytochemicals, in the form of flavones/flavonols (21-24 μg/g) and γ-oryzanol (12.3-8.2 μg/g), together with trace levels of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin.
