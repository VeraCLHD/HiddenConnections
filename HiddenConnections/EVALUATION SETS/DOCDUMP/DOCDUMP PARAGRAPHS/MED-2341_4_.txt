However, several evidences suggested the role of curcumin in multiple diseases, but the major challenge is to obtain optimum therapeutic levels of curcumin due to its low solubility and poor bioavailability. Improved absorption and cellular uptake of curcumin can be achieved through alteration in formulation properties and novel approaches in delivery systems. This review presents an overview of the background of curcumin, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical evidence in chemoprevention of bowel diseases and recent approaches to deliver curcumin for improved cellular uptake and bioavailability.
