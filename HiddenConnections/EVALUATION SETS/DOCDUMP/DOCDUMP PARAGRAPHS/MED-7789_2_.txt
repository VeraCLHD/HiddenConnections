In high risk infants exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months prevents or delays atopic dermatitis, cow milk allergy, and wheezing early in life. There is evidence that supplementing breastfeeding with a hydrolyzed formula protects against atopic disease, especially atopic dermatitis in at risk infants. Finally there is little evidence that delaying the introduction of complimentary foods beyond 4 to 6 months of age has any protective effect against allergy.
