The incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of esophageal carcinoma as well as other malignant tumors in these two groups were followed until the end of 2007. The sodium nitrite exposure time in the study group ranged from 16 to 23 years, with an average of 22.1 years. During 30 years of follow-up, there were 11 esophageal carcinomas and 10 other malignant tumors (4 hepatic cell carcinomas, 3 lung cancers, 2 breast cancers, and 1 leukemia) documented in the study group, while no cancer developed in the control group.
