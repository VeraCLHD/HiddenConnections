Abstract While studying the effect of structure on satiety, effects of mode of consumption, additional water to drink, and thirst have been neglected. The objective was to assess effects of structure, mode of consumption of food, and additional drinking of water on fullness and thirst. In study 1, 20 subjects (BMI 22.5 ± 0.5 kg/m(2); age 21.4 ± 3 years) underwent consumption conditions; SEW: solids to eat + 750 ml water to drink; LEW: liquefied soup to eat including 500 ml water + 250 ml water separately to drink; LDW: the same as LEW but served as drinks; SE, LE, and LD: the same as previous but without water to drink.
