Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for potential confounders. Results Pet owners had a reduced risk of NHL (OR=0.71,CI=0.52 –0.97) and diffuse large-cell and immunoblastic large-cell (DLCL;OR=0.58,CI=0.39 –0.87) compared with those who never had owned a pet. Ever having owned dogs and/or cats was associated with reduced risk of all NHL (OR=0.71,CI=0.54–0.94) and of DLCL (OR=0.60,CI=0.42–0.86).
