However, cholesterol expands with crystallization tearing and perforating fibrous tissues. This study tested the hypothesis that CCs can damage plaques and intima, triggering PD, as observed in tissues prepared without ethanol solvents that dissolve CCs. Coronary arteries of patients who died of acute coronary syndrome (n = 19) and non-acute coronary syndrome causes (n = 12) and carotid plaques from patients with (n = 51) and without (n = 19) neurologic symptoms were studied.
