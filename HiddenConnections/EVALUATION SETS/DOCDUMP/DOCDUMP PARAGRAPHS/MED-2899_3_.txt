Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), antithyroglobulin antibody (anti-TGab) and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOab) were measured. Paired serum samples at year 1 and year 5 from 132 subjects (64 triclosan group, 68 placebo group) were analysed. At year 1 there were no significant differences in thyroid function between the groups: mean (SD) TSH 1.4 (0.8) and 1.6 (0.9) mU/L, triclosan and placebo groups respectively, fT4 15.8 (2.2) and 15.2 (2.1) pmol/L; fT3 4.8 (0.5) and 4.8 (0.5) pmol/L.
