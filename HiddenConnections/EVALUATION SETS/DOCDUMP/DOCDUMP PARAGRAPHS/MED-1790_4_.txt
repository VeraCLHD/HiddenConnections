Since retrovirus-like particles had been identified in milk, and infection can be transmitted by milk, we decided to investigate whether BLV was in mammary epithelial cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pure cultures of mammary epithelial cells were established from cells shed into the milk of 28 cows. BLV was searched in these cultures by immunocytochemistry and the polymerase chain reaction, the specificity of the latter confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and DNA sequencing.
