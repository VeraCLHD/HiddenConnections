Although daylight exposure increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in a controlled laboratory setting, whether it increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in an uncontrolled daily life setting remains unclear.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 192 elderly individuals (mean age, 69.9 yr).
