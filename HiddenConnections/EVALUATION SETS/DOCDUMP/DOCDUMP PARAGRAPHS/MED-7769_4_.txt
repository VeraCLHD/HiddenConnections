Application of a synthetic AMPK activator also supported the evidence that AMPK acts as an upstream signal of PPAR-gamma in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In cancer cells, AMPK was found to act as a regulator of ERK1/2, p38, and COX-2. Regulation of AMPK and its downstream targets such as PPAR-gamma, Mapkinases, and COX-2 by curcumin appears to be important in controlling adipocytes and cancerous cells.
