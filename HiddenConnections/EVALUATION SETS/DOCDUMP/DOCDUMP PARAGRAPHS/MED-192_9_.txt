There was no interaction between pentosidine level, diabetes status, and cognitive decline. Multivariate adjustment for age, sex, race, education, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and diabetes diminished results somewhat but overall patterns remained similar. Conclusion: High peripheral AGE level is associated with greater cognitive decline in older adults with and without diabetes.
