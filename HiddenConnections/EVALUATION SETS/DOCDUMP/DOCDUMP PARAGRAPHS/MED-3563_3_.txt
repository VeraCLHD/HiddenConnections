In stratified meta-analysis we examined the effects of trial duration, trial methodological quality, baseline depression severity, diagnostic indication, dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in omega-3 preparations, and whether omega-3 fatty acid was given as monotherapy or augmentation. In 13 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids involving 731 participants, meta-analysis demonstrated no significant benefit of omega-3 fatty acid treatment compared to placebo (SMD=0.11, 95% CI: -0.04, 0.26). Meta-analysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity and publication bias.
