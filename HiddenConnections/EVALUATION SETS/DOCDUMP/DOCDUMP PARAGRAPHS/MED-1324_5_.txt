After six months, 21.5% of the patients from the dementia group continued to have a full dementia disorder and 78.5% no longer fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for dementia, although some of these patients still showed mild cognitive decline. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that dementia occurs frequently in patients with untreated NCC, and it is reversible in most cases.
