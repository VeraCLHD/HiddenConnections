Abstract The dramatic rising incidence and costs of Alzheimer's disease (AD) require that research efforts and funding be primarily directed on either finding a cure or applying preventive measures to curb this disorder. A cure for AD appears unlikely when significant cognitive loss has occurred because the neuronal networks that controlled the perturbed cognitive abilities are either dead or irreversibly damaged and replacing them, even if it were technically possible, would not reconstruct the intellectual identity of the host. Prevention of risk factors to sporadic AD is a more realistic stratagem and treatment, when indicated, ideally should begin in cognitively intact individuals as part of a mass screening effort.
