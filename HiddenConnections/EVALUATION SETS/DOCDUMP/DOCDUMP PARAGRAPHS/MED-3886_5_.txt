Assuming similar yields as observed in the present study as a worst case scenario the use of PCNB in Australia may result in the formation of 155 g TEQ annum(-1), contributed primarily by OCDD formation. This warrants detailed evaluations on the contemporary release of PCDD/Fs to the environment after the use of pesticides. Changes in congener profiles (including the ratio of PCDDs to PCDFs (DF ratio)) suggest that pesticide sources of PCDD/Fs after sunlight exposure may not be recognized based on matching source fingerprints established from manufacturing impurities.
