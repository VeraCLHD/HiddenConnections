There was a trend toward a smaller size of largest polyp in patients treated with aspirin versus non-aspirinâ€”mean 3.8 mm versus 5.5 mm for patients treated one or more years (adjusted P = 0.09) and mean 3.0 mm versus 6.0 mm for patients treated more than one year (P = 0.02); there were weaker such trends with RS versus non-RS. Exploratory translational endpoints included crypt length (which was significantly shorter in normal-appearing mucosa in the RS group over time) and laboratory measures of proliferation (including Ki67). This clinical trial is the largest one ever conducted in the setting of FAP and found a trend of reduced polyp load (number and size) with 600 mg of aspirin daily.
