Abstract The objective of this study was to investigate, whether the plant-derived isothiocyanate Sulforaphane (SFN) enhances the antitumor activities of the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin (Ox) in a cell culture model of colorectal cancer. Caco-2 cells were cultured under standard conditions and treated with increasing concentrations of SFN [1-20 μM] and/or Ox [100 nM-10 μM]. For co-incubation, cells were pre-treated with SFN for 24 h. Cell growth was determined by BrdU incorporation.
