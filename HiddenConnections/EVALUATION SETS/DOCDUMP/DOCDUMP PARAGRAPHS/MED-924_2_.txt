The total mercury concentrations in the hair of ordinary diseased people (atopic dermatitis, asthma, dementia, cerebral infarct, osteoporosis, hypertension and diabetes) were from 2.08 ppm to 36.5 ppm. Those values were considerably higher than that of healthy people of the same age groups. However, the uptake routes and the metabolic mechanism of high hair mercury concentrations in diseased people are not clear.
