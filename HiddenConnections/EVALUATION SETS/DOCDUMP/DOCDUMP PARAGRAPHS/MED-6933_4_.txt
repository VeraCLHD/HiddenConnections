Subsequently, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic activity represent important activities for preventing, suppressing, or reversing the development of carcinogenesis. Ultimately, these mechanisms of action may provide a useful basis for screening novel phytochemicals for chemopreventive activity. In this review, we identify the important molecular processes that may be targeted in routine screenings of dietary phytochemicals to ultimately select the most effective potential candidates for cancer chemoprevention.
