Abstract Chlorophyll (Chla) and chlorophyllin (CHL) were shown previously to reduce carcinogen bioavailability, biomarker damage, and tumorigenicity in trout and rats. These findings were partially extended to humans, where CHL reduced excretion of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-DNA repair products in Chinese unavoidably exposed to dietary AFB1. However, neither AFB1 pharmacokinetics nor Chla effects were examined.
