Balsamic vinegar dramatically inhibited LDL oxidation by azoradicals and endothelial cell-mediated oxidation in vitro. Further, we assessed the anti-oxidative effect against LDL after balsamic vinegar consumption in human subjects. Balsamic vinegar prolonged the LDL oxidation lag time and decreased lipid peroxide (LPO) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) in LDL particles.
