Food samples of 3 nuts (peanut, almond, pistachio) and 3 vegetables (cauliflower, radish, and carrot) were chewed and expectorated after self-estimated complete mastication. Measurements with sieving and laser diffraction methods indicated that particles were much larger in vegetables than in nuts. Particle size distributions were similar among nuts and among vegetables.
