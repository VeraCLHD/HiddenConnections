The impact of whole-grain intake was undetectable in men who harbored diabetogenic polymorphisms of the TCF7L2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: A higher intake of whole grain is associated with decreased risk of deteriorating glucose tolerance including progression from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes by mechanisms likely tied to effects on insulin sensitivity. Effect modifications by TCF7L2 genetic polymorphisms are supported.
