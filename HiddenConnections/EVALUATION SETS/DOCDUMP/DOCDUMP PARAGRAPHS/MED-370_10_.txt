Pharmacologically treated hyperlipidemia was associated with sciatica in women (2.02; 1.01-4.04), but not in men (1.71; 0.83-3.55). CONCLUSIONS: Independent of BMI and other possible confounders, clinically assessed sciatica in men was associated with levels of atherogenic serum lipids. Pharmacologically treated hyperlipidemia was associated with sciatica in women.
