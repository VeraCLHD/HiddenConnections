We used logistic regression to calculate the multivariable odds ratio (OR) of total, and Gleason 2-6 (n=993), 7 (n=199), and 8-10 (n=59) prostate cancer comparing low (normal: < 200 mg/dL) to high (borderline and elevated cholesterol: â‰¥ 200 mg/dL) serum cholesterol. Results Men with low cholesterol had a lower risk of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer (OR=0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.77) than men with high cholesterol. No association was present for prostate cancer overall (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.11), Gleason 2-6 disease (OR=1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.18), or Gleason 7 disease (OR=0.93, 95% CI 0.69-1.24).
