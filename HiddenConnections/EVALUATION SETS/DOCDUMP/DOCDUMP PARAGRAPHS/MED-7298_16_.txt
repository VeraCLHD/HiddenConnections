Slight increases in packed cell volume, haemoglobin concentration and thrombocytes occurred with cadaverine. With spermidine, decreased plasma creatinine, calcium and inorganic phosphate were observed and decreased potassium levels with cadaverine. The no-observed-adverse-effect level was 2000 ppm (180 mg/kg body weight/day) for tyramine, cadaverine and putrescine, 1000 ppm (83 mg/kg body weight/day) for spermidine and 200 ppm (19 mg/kg body weight/day) for spermine.
