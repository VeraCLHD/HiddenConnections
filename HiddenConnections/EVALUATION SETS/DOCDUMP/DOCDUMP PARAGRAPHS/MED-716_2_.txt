In the present study, the effects of drinking raw DM (for 4 weeks) on energy balance, lipid metabolism, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant/detoxifying defences was compared to that produced by rat intake of an iso-energetic amount of raw cow's milk. The hypolipidemic effect produced by DM paralleled with the enhanced mitochondrial activity/proton leakage and with the increased activity or expression of mitochondrial markers namely, carnitine palmitoyl transferase and uncoupling protein 2. The association of decreased energy efficiency with reduced proinflammatory signs (TNF-Î± and LPS levels) with the significant increase antioxidant (total thiols) and detoxifying enzyme activities (glutathione-S-transferase NADH quinone oxidoreductase) in DM-treated animals, indicated that beneficial effects were attributable, at least in part, to the activation of nuclear factor 2 erythroid-related factor 2 pathway.
