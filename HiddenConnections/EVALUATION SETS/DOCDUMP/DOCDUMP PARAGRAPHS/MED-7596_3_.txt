METHODS: Total 774 older adults [48% female; mean (standard deviation) age = 62 (7) years] were examined at baseline and follow-up. Differences in percentage appendicular lean mass (%ALM), leg strength, leg muscle quality (LMQ; specific force) and falls risk were compared for statin users and non-users. RESULTS: There were 147 (19%) statin users at baseline and 179 (23%) at follow-up.
