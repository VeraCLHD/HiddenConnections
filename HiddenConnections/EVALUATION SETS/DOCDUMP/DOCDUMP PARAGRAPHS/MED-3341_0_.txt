Abstract OBJECTIVES: To measure, in vitro, the pH and titratable acidity (TA) of various soft drinks and to assess the erosive effect of smoothies using an in situ model. METHOD: The in vitro phase of this study included measuring the inherent pH of six different commercially available smoothies, diet coke, and citric acid 0.3% (positive control) using a pH meter. The TA was determined by titration with NaOH.
