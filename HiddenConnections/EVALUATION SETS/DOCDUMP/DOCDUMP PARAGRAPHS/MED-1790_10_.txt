Simultaneous detection of BLV p24 and cytokeratins, localized antigen expression to the mammary epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These indications of BLV in mammary epithelial cells in vivo suggest that BLV is capable of infecting and expressing antigen in glandular epithelium in vivo and has a broader tissue tropism than was previously thought. They raise the question of how persistent mammary infection by BLV may influence the course of bovine lymphoma, and what effect the virus may have on the mammary gland.
