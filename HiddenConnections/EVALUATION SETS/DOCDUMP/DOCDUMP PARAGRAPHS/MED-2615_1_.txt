We re-examined this issue using a conjoint analysis approach. METHODS: We asked older hospital patients with a history of falls, fracture or osteoporosis to imagine they had a hip fracture resulting in significant residual disability. Subjects were asked to rank in order of preference an orthogonal array of nine out of 36 potential outcome scenarios reporting risk of falls, life expectancy, discharge home with support or to a nursing home and family agreement or disagreement with discharge location.
