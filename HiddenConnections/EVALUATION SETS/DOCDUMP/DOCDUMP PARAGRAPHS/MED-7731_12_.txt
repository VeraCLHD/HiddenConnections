CONCLUSIONS: Vibrio necrotizing soft-tissue infections should be suspected in patients with appropriate clinical findings and history of contact with seawater or seafood. V. cholerae non-O1 may cause bacteremia more often than V. vulnificus in patients with liver cirrhosis. Early fasciotomy and culture-directed antimicrobial therapy are aggressively recommended in patients with hypotensive shock, leukopenia, high band forms of white blood cells, decreased platelet counts, severe hypoalbuminemia, and underlying chronic illness, such as hepatic dysfunction and diabetes mellitus.
