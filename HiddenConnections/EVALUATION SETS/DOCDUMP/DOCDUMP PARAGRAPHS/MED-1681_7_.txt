Apigenin was the most potent inhibitor with significant inhibition of mRNA(arom) seen at both 10 microM and 100 nM, whilst other flavonoids (except biochanin A) only induced significant inhibition (p<or=0.05) at the higher dose. Low dose (100 nM) mixtures of the compounds were ineffective except for a combination of the three isoflavones that induced a significant inhibition of mRNA(arom). The changes in aromatase activity paralleled the mRNA(arom) results and additional studies showed that the reduction in aromatase activity was significantly delayed in time compared with the reduction in mRNA(arom.)
