In all patients with IBS, both thresholds were reduced after RRD load, but they were reduced in none of the patients with FAPS. RRD significantly reduced both thresholds in the IBS group (P < 0.05), but it had no effect in the control or FAPS groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal hypersensitivity induced by RRD may be a reliable marker for IBS.
