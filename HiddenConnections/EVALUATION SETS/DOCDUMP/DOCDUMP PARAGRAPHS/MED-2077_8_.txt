Extensive work with human breast cancer cell lines has shown estrogenic stimulation in those possessing ER but a reduction in DMBA-induced breast cancers in rodents given ZEN. Protein disulfide isomerase provides a molecular biomarker of dietary exposure to ZEN and its derivatives allowing the detection and control of harmful food intake. The interaction of ZEN with anti-estrogens, anticancer agents and antioxidants requires further investigation.
