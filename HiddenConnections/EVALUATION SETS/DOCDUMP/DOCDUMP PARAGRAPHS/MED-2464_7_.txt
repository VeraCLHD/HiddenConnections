After an average time of 3.9 years, IMT(mean) increased by 0.02 (0.07) mm in the acarbose group versus 0.05 (0.06) mm in the placebo group (P=0.027). The annual increase of IMT(mean) was reduced by approximately 50% in the acarbose group versus placebo. Multiple linear regression revealed IMT progression as significantly related to acarbose intake.
