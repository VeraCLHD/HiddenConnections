INTRODUCTION: Conservation of skeletal muscle is important for preventing falls and fractures but age-related loss of muscle mass occurs even in healthy individuals. However, the mild metabolic acidosis associated with an acidogenic dietary acid-base load could influence loss of muscle mass. METHODS: We investigated the association between fat-free mass (FFM), percentage FFM (FFM%) and fat-free mass index (FFMI, weight/heightÂ²), measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 2,689 women aged 18-79 years from the TwinsUK Study, and dietary acid-base load.
