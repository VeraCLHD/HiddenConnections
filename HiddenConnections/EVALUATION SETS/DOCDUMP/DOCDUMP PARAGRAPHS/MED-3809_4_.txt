More telling is the gradual accumulation of insoluble fibrous material within some neurons that consists mainly of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. Six stages of increasingly severe cortical destruction can be distinguished. Stages I and II are characterized by neurofibrillary changes that are largely confined to the transentorhinal region, whereas stages III and IV are marked by severe involvement of both the entorhinal and transentorhinal regions.
