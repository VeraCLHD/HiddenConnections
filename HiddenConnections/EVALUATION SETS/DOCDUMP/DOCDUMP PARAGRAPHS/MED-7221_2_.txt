In the present work, the internal dose by inhalation of ultrafine and fine particles is assessed, using an appropriate mechanistic model of lung deposition, accommodating aerosol, and inhalation dynamics. The analysis is based on size distribution measurements (10-350 nm) of indoor and outdoor aerosol number concentrations in a typical residence in Athens, Greece. Four different cases are examined, namely, a cooking event, a no activity period indoors and the equivalent time periods outdoors.
