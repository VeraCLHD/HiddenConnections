Abstract OBJECTIVE: Examine the influence of altering the size of snack food (ie, small vs large cookies) on short-term energy intake. METHODS: First- and sixth-graders (n = 77) participated in a between-subjects experimental design. All participants were offered the same gram weight of cookies during an afternoon tea at their school.
