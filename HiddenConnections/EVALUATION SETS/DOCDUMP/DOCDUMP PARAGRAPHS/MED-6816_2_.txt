METHODS: Eight women (aged 48-74 years) were enrolled in an 8-week pilot trial employing a sequential design. During the initial 4-week Program A (control), participants consumed a modified US Department of Agriculture food pyramid diet and a rice protein powder supplement that provided basic macronutrient support. During the second 4-week Program B (intervention), participants consumed a modified elimination diet and a phytonutrient-rich medical food.
