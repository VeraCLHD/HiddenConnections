We examined whether measurement of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle subclasses provides additional information relative to CHD risk reduction. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a prospective nested case-control study of 364 men with a new CHD event (nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiac death) during a 5.1-year (median) follow-up and 697 age-matched controls. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to quantify levels of LDL and HDL particle subclasses and mean particle sizes in plasma obtained at baseline and after 7 months of treatment with gemfibrozil or placebo.
