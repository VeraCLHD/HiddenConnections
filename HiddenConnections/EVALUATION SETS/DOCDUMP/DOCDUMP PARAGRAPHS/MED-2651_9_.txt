The increase in FMD was not significantly different between the two tea preparations (BAD for 2 h of FMD, green tea v. black tea: 0.66 (95 % CI - 0.76, 2.09) %; P = 0.36). NMD did not vary between any of the groups. In conclusion, green and black tea are equally effective in improving endothelial function.
