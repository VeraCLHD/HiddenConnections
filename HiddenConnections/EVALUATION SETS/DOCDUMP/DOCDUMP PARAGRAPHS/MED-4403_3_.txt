RESULTS—Twenty one (22%) men and nine (20%) women had occluded arteries, and an additional 33 (35%) men and 17 (38%) women had narrowed arteries. The mean age for men with occluded or narrowed arteries, or both, was 50 years and for women 59 years. Most of the stenotic changes were seen at the orifices or in the first part of the arteries.
