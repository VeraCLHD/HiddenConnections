Cases which were negative for BRCA1 protein were more frequently positive for basal markers (29 versus 5 %) and were more often ER-negative (62 versus 39 %) than BRCA1-positive tumours. Methylation of BRCA1 promoter region was seen in 11/45 cases (24 %). All 11 cases showing BRCA1 methylation had absent (eight cases) or reduced (three cases) BRCA1 protein expression.
