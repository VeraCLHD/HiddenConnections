Abstract Objective: Diet may be associated with risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined the association between fruit and vegetable consumption in midlife and risk for all types of dementia and AD. Methods: Participants were 3,779 members of the Swedish Twin Registry who completed a diet questionnaire approximately 30 years prior to cognitive screening and full clinical evaluation for dementia as part of the HARMONY study.
