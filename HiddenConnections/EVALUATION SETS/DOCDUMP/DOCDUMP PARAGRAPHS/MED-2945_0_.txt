Abstract BACKGROUND: Presence of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) epsilon4 allele, which is involved in cholesterol metabolism, is the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Elevated midlife values for total cholesterol level and blood pressure have been implicated recently as risk factors for Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: To study the relative importance and the putative relationship among the apoE epsilon4 allele, midlife total cholesterol level, and midlife blood pressure as risk factors for late-life Alzheimer disease.
