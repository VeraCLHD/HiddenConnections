High sulphur (OR 2.76 (95% CI 1.19–6.4)) or sulphate (OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.08–6.3)) intakes were also associated with relapse and may offer an explanation for the observed increased likelihood of relapse. Conclusions: Potentially modifiable dietary factors, such as a high meat or alcoholic beverage intake, have been identified that are associated with an increased likelihood of relapse for UC patients. Further studies are needed to determine if it is the sulphur compounds within these foods that mediates the likelihood of relapse and if reducing their intake would reduce relapse frequency.
