Abstract The incidence of autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory disease is increasing due to as yet unidentified environmental factors related to western living conditions. Here, I propose that alterations in the gut microbiome, acting via regulatory T cells (Tregs), may be responsible for this epidemic. Tregs control the threshold for peripheral antigen recognition via tonic downregulation of dendritic cell (DC) costimulation, and are also implicated in maintaining the tolerogenic function of DCs.
