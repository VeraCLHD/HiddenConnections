Twelve subjects had normal fasting homocysteine (mean +/- SD, 7.6 +/- 1.1 mumol/L) and methionine concentrations (22.7 +/- 3.5 mumol/L) and were included in the statistical analyses. Breakfast caused a small but significant increase in plasma methionine (22.2 +/- 20.6%) and a brief, nonsignificant increase followed by a significant decline in free homocysteine. However, changes in total and bound homocysteine were small.
