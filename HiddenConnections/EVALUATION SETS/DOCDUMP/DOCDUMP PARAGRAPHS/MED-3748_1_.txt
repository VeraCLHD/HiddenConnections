Evaluation of the dietary PRAL seems to be advisable to evaluate the lithogenic potential of the diet of the individual patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On the basis of a dietary questionnaire administered to a sample of 75 renal stone formers living in the urban area of Milan (Northern Italy), we selected the most frequently reported foods for each of 11 categories: grains, meats, cured meats, eggs, cheeses, legumes, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and juices, milk and dairies and bread. The PRAL per 100 g of each food was calculated considering its mineral and protein composition, the mean intestinal absorption rate for each nutrient and the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids.
