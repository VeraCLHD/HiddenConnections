Eight studies observed a statistically significant positive association between urinary or serum BPA levels and BMI, and ten studies observed no association. Studies where BMI was a primary outcome and studies of neutral quality were more likely to observe an association. CONCLUSIONS: Study results are conflicting and significant methodological issues limit the ability to draw conclusions from these studies.
