Immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly lower in the non-obese group, suggesting that the non-obese patients were not overtly insulin resistant. Although serum adiponectin and TNF-alpha levels were similar in both groups, leptin levels were significantly higher in the obese group. Total energy and carbohydrate intake tended to be higher in the obese group.
