Numerous epidemiological studies have measured concentration of enterolignans, mainly enterolactone, in blood or urine as a biomarker of lignan exposure and studied its relation to breast cancer risk. Case-control studies have shown decreased breast cancer risk associated with high circulating enterolactone concentrations, but results demonstrated by prospective cohort studies are less clear. The purpose of this review is to discuss factors that may contribute to these contradictory findings obtained in epidemiological studies, including age distribution, enterolactone measurement error, heterogeneity of breast cancer subtypes, and genetic factors.
