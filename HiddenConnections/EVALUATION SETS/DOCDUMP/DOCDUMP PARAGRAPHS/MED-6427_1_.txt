In this study, the medical records for 18 subjects who received donor stool by nasogastric tube for recurrent C. difficile infection during a 9-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. During the period between the initial diagnosis of C. difficile colitis and the stool treatments, the 18 subjects received a total of 64 courses of antimicrobials (range, 2-7 courses; median, 3 courses). During the 90 days after receipt of treatment with stool, 2 patients died of unrelated illnesses.
