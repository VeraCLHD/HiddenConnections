Nicotine concentration was determined in several frequently consumed vegetables from the nightshade family (Solanaceae) (i.e., tomatoes, potatoes, aubergines, and peppers), as well as in some of their processed products. The edible Solanaceae fruit analyzed in this investigation were found to contain relatively consistent amounts of nicotine in the range of 2-7 microg/kg for fresh fruits. Nevertheless, the nicotine concentrations of the investigated tomato varieties decreased significantly with increasing degree of ripening of the fruits.
