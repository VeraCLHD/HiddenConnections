Although the study physicians slightly disagreed that it may be inappropriate for them to accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies, they seemed slightly averse to having 'gift relationships' between pharmaceutical companies and physicians made public. Correlation analysis suggested that physicians who have a large number of patients in their practice, see a larger number of patients per day, or write a large number of prescriptions per day are more likely to be offered gifts by pharmaceutical companies, and they are also more likely to condone the practice of gift giving and receiving.
