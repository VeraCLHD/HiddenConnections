However, when stratified by sex, there was an association between the highest quartile of nonfried fish consumption and a 0.10-mm lower (1 SD) brachial artery diameter in men (P = 0.01) and a 0.27% smaller FMD in women (P = 0.02) compared with the lowest quartile of nonfried fish intake in each respective sex strata. When stratified by race-ethnicity and race-ethnicity by sex, additional heterogeneity was noted, but results were difficult to interpret because of small sample sizes. Plasma phospholipid omega-3 concentrations showed a similar directionality of association with brachial artery measures observed for nonfried fish consumption, although statistical significance was not achieved in fully adjusted models.
