IL-2 and IL-4 secretion values were significantly suppressed after the low-carotenoid diet (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively compared with baseline). Tomato juice consumption significantly enhanced IL-2 (P < 0.001) and IL-4 secretion (P < 0.05) compared with the end of depletion period. After carrot juice and spinach powder consumption the cytokine secretion capacity of PBMC was not significantly different from that at the end of the depletion period.
