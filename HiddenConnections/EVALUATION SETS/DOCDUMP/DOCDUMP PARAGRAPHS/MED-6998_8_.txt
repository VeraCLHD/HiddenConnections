In males, animal protein intake was positively associated with BMI (β = 0·013; P = 0·001) and waist circumference (WC; β = 0·041; P = 0·002). Both in males and females, plant protein intake was inversely associated with BMI (males: β = - 0·036; P < 0·001; females: β = - 0·046; P = 0·001) and WC (male: β = - 0·137; P < 0·001; female: β = - 0·096; P = 0·024). In conclusion, plant protein intakes were lower than animal protein intakes among a representative sample of the Belgian population and decreased with age.
