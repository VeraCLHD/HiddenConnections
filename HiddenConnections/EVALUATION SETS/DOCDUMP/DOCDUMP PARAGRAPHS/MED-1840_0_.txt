Abstract PURPOSE: Recently, an unprecedented 1-year 7% decrease in the overall incidence of invasive female breast cancer in the United States was reported. It has been suggested that the decrease resulted from the mass cessation of estrogen-progestin hormone therapy (EPHT) in 2002. We took advantage of California's unique population-based cancer surveillance resources to assess whether regional changes in breast cancer incidence observed between 2001 and 2004 correlated with regional changes in EPHT use between 2001 and 2003.
