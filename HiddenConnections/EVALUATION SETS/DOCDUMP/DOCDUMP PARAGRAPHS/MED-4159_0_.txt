Abstract Mean faecal pH values did not differ significantly in groups of rural South African Black schoolchildren of 10--12 years who ate their traditional high-fibre low-fat diet, and urban dwellers who consumed a partially westernized diet. However, both means were significantly lower than those of groups of White schoolchildren. In feeding studies of 5 days' duration, mean faecal pH value of Black children became significantly less acid when white bread replaced maize meal, and became significantly more acid when a supplement of 6 oranges was consumed daily.
