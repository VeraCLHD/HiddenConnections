Steroid use was significantly associated with perforation rates as well as mortality (P< 0.001 and P = 0.002). Comorbidities such as diabetes, collagenâ€“vascular disease, and immune system compromise were also highly associated with death (P = 0.006, P = 0.009, and P = 0.003, respectively). Overall morbidity was 41.4%.
