In field surveys, the presumed rates of human papillomavirus infection based on a DNA assay such as the filter in situ hybridization may be a gross overestimation of the true viral prevalence. Use of moderately misclassified human papillomavirus infection test results for effect estimation and covariate adjustment in data analysis may seriously distort the underlying relations. Consequently, considering these conditions, the apparent incoherence of recent epidemiologic findings should not be construed as evidence against the role of human papillomavirus in the etiology of cervical cancer or the validity of the sexually transmitted disease model.
