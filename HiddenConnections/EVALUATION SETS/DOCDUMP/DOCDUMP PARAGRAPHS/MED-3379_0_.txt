Abstract Physical properties of food may account for differences in glycemic and other metabolic responses to food with similar amounts of carbohydrate, fat and protein. Blending of cooked beans made no difference to plasma glucose, insulin, or GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide) responses in nondiabetics, NIDD (noninsulin-dependent diabetics), and IDD (insulin-dependent diabetics). The cooked blended beans gave a greater plasma glucose response and a lesser hormonal response than a cooked flummery (containing cornstarch, protein and fat) in nondiabetics.
