Risk factors disclosed by epidemiological studies that may accelerate the pathogenetic process are: a cold environment, a high growth rate, infections and stressful life events. Risk factors that may initiate the autoimmune process include early exposure to cow's milk proteins, nitrosamines or early foetal events such as blood group incompatibility or foetal viral infections. In conclusion, population-based epidemiological studies have helped to confirm proposed aetiological models that have arisen from experimental research.
