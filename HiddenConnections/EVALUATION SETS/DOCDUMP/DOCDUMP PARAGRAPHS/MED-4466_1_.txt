The aim of our study was to establish the prevalence of malignancies in states of congenital IGF-I deficiency. SUBJECTS: We surveyed 222 patients with congenital IGF-I deficiency (Laron syndrome, GH gene deletion, GHRH receptor defects and IGF-I resistance) and 338 first and second-degree relatives. RESULTS: None of the IGF-I deficient patients had cancer, whereas 9-24% of the family members had a history of malignancy.
