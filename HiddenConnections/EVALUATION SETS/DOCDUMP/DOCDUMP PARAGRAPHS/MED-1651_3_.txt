Eight healthy volunteers ingested 300 or 1200 GalU of alpha-galactosidase or placebo during a test meal containing 420 g of cooked beans. Breath hydrogen excretion and occurrence of bloating, abdominal pain, discomfort, flatulence, and diarrhea were measured for 8 hr. The administration of 1200 GalU of alpha-galactosidase induced a significant reduction of both breath hydrogen excretion and severity of flatulence.
