The potency was assayed by analysing differences in expression levels of endogenous oestrogen-regulated genes in human MCF7 cells, treated with different concentrations of the compounds. Zeranol, 17beta-oestradiol and DES were about equally potent, genistein was four to six orders of magnitude less potent than 17beta-oestradiol but an order of magnitude more potent than Bisphenol-A. There were gene specific differences, the PS2 and TGFbeta3 genes were about equally sensitive to Zeranol, 17beta-oestradiol and DES whereas a down-regulation of MRG1/p35srj could be detected at fmol/l concentrations of Zeranol whereas 17beta-oestradiol was several orders of magnitude less potent.
