Abstract Background Dietary patterns have been linked to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, but sparse data are currently available on associations between dietary patterns and microalbuminuria or kidney function decline. Study Design Subgroup analysis from a prospective observational cohort study Setting and Participants Female participants in the Nursesâ€™ Health Study who had dietary patterns data from food frequency questionnaires returned in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998 and urinary albumin-creatinine ratios (ACR) from the year 2000 (n=3121); estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change between 1989 and 2000 was available in 3071. Predictor Prudent (higher intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole grains), Western (higher intake of red and processed meats, saturated fats, and sweets), and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style dietary patterns (also greater intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains).
