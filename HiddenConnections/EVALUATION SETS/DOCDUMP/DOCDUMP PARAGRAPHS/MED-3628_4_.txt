Although few such data are presently available from clinical trials, it seems that patients who have a therapeutic response to therapy for IBS have a corresponding improvement in HRQoL. There seems to be no major differences in HRQoL based on IBS subtype (constipation-dominant or diarrhea-dominant). However, the severity of bowel symptoms in IBS is associated with a corresponding impact on HRQoL and patients with worse bowel symptoms have a greater diminished QoL compared with patients with milder symptoms.
