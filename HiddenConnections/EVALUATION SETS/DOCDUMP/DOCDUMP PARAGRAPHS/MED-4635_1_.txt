Methods and Results Baseline lipoproteins were measured by NMR in 27,673 initially healthy women followed for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD, N=1,015) over 11 years. Adjusting for non-lipid risk factors, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for top vs bottom quintile of NMR-measured lipoprotein particle concentration (particles/L) were, for low-density lipoprotein (LDLNMR) 2.51 (1.91−3.30), high-density lipoprotein (HDLNMR) 0.91 (0.75−1.12), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDLNMR) 1.71 (1.38−2.12), and LDLNMR/HDLNMR ratio 2.25 (1.80−2.81). Similarly-adjusted results for NMR-measured lipoprotein particle size (nanometers) were, for LDLNMR size 0.64 (0.52−0.79), HDLNMR size 0.65 (0.51−0.81), and VLDLNMR size 1.37 (1.10−1.70).
