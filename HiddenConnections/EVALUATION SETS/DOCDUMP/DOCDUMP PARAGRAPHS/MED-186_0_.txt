Abstract Crohn's disease is a life-long idiopathic inflammatory disease which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract and occasionally extra-intestinal organs. CD is thought to result from complex interactions between environmental factors, the gut microbes, and the genetic background and the immune system of the host. In the last decades research on these pathogenetic components, and especially on mucosal immunity, has led to the development of biologic agents and therapeutic strategies that have improved dramatically the treatment of CD but we are still far away from curing the disease.
