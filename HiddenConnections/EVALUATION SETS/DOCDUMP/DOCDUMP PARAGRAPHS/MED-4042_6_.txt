Maintenance of the normal diet of the participants and the correct intake of the capsules were monitored, using 6 x 3-day food recording and counting of the provided capsules. Predefined outcome measures were BDG-induced changes in pro and antiinflammatory markers in circulating blood and gene expression in adipose tissue and peripheral insulin sensitivity expressed as M value. The BDG consumption for 4 weeks significantly increased both circulating levels and adipose tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in overweight and obese humans.
