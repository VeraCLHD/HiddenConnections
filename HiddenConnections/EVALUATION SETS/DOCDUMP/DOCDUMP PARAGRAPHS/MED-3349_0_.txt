Abstract The effects of vegetables in mixed meals on satiety were evaluated by varying the dose (portions 150 and 250 g containing 4.3 and 7.2 g of dietary fibre, respectively) and structure (cut and minced) of microwaved spinach. A control meal without spinach and the test meals with spinach were balanced regarding energy (2000 kJ) and digestible carbohydrates (59 g, 51 E%) and with protein and fat as far as possible similar. The meals were served in the morning, after an overnight fast, to ten healthy male volunteers.
