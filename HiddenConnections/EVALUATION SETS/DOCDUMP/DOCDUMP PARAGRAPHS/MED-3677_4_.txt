In addition, they contribute to beta-cell failure in genetically predisposed individuals. NEFAs cause beta-cell apoptosis and may thus contribute to progressive beta-cell loss in Type 2 diabetes. The molecular pathways and regulators involved in NEFA-mediated beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis are beginning to be understood.
