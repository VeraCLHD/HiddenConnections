A significant (p < 0.001) brand difference was noted: Brand 3 contained higher Hg concentrations ($\bar x$ standard deviation (SD) (0.777 +/- 0.320 ppm) than Brands 1 (0.541 +/- 0.114 ppm) and 2 (0.550 +/- 0.199 ppm). Chunk white tuna (0.619 +/- 0.212 ppm) and solid white tuna (0.576 +/- 0.178 ppm) were both significantly (p < 0.001) higher in mean Hg than chunk light tuna (0.137 +/- 0.063 ppm). No significant temporal variation was noted, and packaging had no significant effect on Hg concentration.
