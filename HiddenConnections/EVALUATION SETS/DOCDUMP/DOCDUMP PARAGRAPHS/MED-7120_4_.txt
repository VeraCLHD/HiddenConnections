RESULTS: Latencies of peaks III and V increased by about 0.012 ms when the cord blood mercury concentration doubled. As seen at age 7 years, this effect appeared mainly within the I-III interpeak interval. Despite lower postnatal exposures, the child's hair mercury level at age 14 years was associated with prolonged III-V interpeak latencies.
