History of treatment for urinary tract infection was studied for its prediction of breast cancer among 9461 Finnish women 19–89 years of age and initially cancer-free. During a follow-up in 1973–1991, a total of 157 breast cancer cases were diagnosed. Women reporting previous or present medication for urinary tract infection at baseline showed an elevated breast cancer risk in comparison with other women.
