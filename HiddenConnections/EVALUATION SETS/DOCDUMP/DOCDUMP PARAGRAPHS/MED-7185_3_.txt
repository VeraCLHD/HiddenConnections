Offal products generally showed lower contaminant levels which may be a result of processing or dilution. For most samples, the main contribution to WHO-TEQ arose from PCDD/Fs rather than PCBs. Just under half of the lamb liver samples showed PCDD/F concentrations that exceeded the EU maximum limit of 6 ng kg(-1) fat weight (although deer liver which is not subject to the regulation, generally showed higher levels).
