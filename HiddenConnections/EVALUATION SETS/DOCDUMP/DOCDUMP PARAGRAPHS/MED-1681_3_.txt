Experiments were carried out on primary cultures of human granulosa-luteal (GL) cells after they had been exposed to phytoestrogens for 48 h. Aromatase activity was measured by the ability of cells to convert testosterone to estradiol over a 4h period and aromatase mRNA expression (mRNA(arom)) was subsequently measured from the same cells using quantitative real-time PCR. The compounds investigated were the flavones, apigenin and quercetin, and the isoflavones, genistein, biochanin A and daidzein at doses of 10 microM and 100 nM. Combinations of these compounds at the lower dose were also investigated.
