Besides homeostatic processes, the gustatory cortex, including parts of the insular cortex, is crucial for the processing of food items. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of high- compared with low-fat meals on the hypothalamus and the insular cortex. DESIGN: Eleven healthy men participated in a single-blinded, functional MRI study of high- and low-fat meals on 2 measurement days.
