Patients were randomly assigned to receive capsule saffron 30 mg/day (15 mg twice per day) (Group A) or capsule placebo (two capsules per day) for a 16-week study. RESULTS: After 16 weeks, saffron produced a significantly better outcome on cognitive function than placebo (ADAS-cog: F=4路12, d.f.=1, P=0路04; CDR: F=4路12, d.f.=1, P=0路04). There were no significant differences in the two groups in terms of observed adverse events.
