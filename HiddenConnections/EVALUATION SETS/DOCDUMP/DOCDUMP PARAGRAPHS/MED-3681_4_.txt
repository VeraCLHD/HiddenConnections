Postprandial total and very low density lipoproteins triglyceride at +4 hours and +6 hours, triglyceride area under the curve, and incremental triglyceride area under the curve were higher in NASH compared with controls. Saturated fat intake correlated with ISI, with the different features of the metabolic syndrome, and with the postprandial rise of triglyceride. Postprandial apolipoprotein (Apo) B48 and ApoB100 responses in NASH were flat and strikingly dissociated from the triglyceride response, suggesting a defect in ApoB secretion.
