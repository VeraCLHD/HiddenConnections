Systemic changes were observed in LOOH and for lipid-soluble antioxidants throughout exercise (P < 0.05); however, there was no observed change in protein carbonyl concentration (P > 0.05). These findings identify lipid-derived free radical species as possible contributors to peripheral mononuclear cell DNA damage in the human exercising model. This damage occurs in the presence of lipid oxidation but in the absence of any change to protein carbonyl concentration.
