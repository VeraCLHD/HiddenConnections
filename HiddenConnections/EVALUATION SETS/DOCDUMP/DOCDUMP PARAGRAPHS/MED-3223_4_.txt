The identification of a variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene as a major genetic risk factor for AD is also consistent with a role for cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.

In this review, we describe recent findings concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-AD connection.
