Elevated cholesterol levels increase Abeta in cellular and most animals models of AD, and drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis lower Abeta in these models. Recent studies show that not only the total amount, but also the distribution of cholesterol within neurons, impacts Abeta biogenesis. The identification of a variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene as a major genetic risk factor for AD is also consistent with a role for cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD.
