Abstract The need for consistent and current data describing the true incidence of SCA and/or SCD was highlighted during the most recent Sudden Cardiac Arrest Thought Leadership Alliance’s (SCATLA) Think Tank meeting of national experts with broad representation of key stakeholders including thought leaders and representatives from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. As such, to evaluate the true magnitude of this public health problem, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE using the MeSH headings, “death, sudden” OR the terms “sudden cardiac death” OR “sudden cardiac arrest” OR “cardiac arrest” OR “cardiac death” OR “sudden death” OR “arrhythmic death.” Study selection criteria included peer-reviewed publications of primary data used to estimate SCD incidence in the U.S.
