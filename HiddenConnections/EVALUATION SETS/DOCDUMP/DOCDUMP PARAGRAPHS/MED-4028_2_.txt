Furthermore, in 1/2 the samples almost all (greater than 99%) of the total BMAA was removed. We found no significant regional differences in the BMAA content of flour prepared from cycad seeds collected from several villages on Guam. Testing of different samples prepared by the same Chamorro woman over 2 years suggests that the washing procedure probably varies in thoroughness from preparation to preparation but is routinely efficient in removing at least 85% of the total BMAA from all batches.
