Lesion depths (i.e., eroded surfaces) were measured using Image Pro Plus software. Differences in physiochemical properties and lesion depths between beverages were investigated using one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD test. Relationships among lesion depths and physiochemical properties were evaluated using the Pearson correlation test.
