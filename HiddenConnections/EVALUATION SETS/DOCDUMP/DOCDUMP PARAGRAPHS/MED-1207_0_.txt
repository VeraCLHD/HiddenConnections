Abstract OBJECTIVE: Vegetarians are more vascular-healthy but those with subnormal vitamin B-12 status have impaired arterial endothelial function and increased intima-media thickness. We aimed to study the impact of vitamin B-12 supplementation on these markers, in the vegetarians. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised crossover study.
