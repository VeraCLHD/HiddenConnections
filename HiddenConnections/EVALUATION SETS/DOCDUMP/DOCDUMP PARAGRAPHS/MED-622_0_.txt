Abstract BACKGROUND: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are pre-diabetic states, treatment of which may prevent or delay the onset of overt diabetes and thus potentially reduce major cardiovascular (CV) events. We therefore sought to determine whether interventions (including diet, exercise and pharmacological therapy), altered all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality in such subjects. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were identified in the medical literature and databases.
