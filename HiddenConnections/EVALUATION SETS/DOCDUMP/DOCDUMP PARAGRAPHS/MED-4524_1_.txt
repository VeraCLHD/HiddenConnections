DESIGN: Semen samples were prepared by a discontinuous Percoll gradient to separate sperm and seminal plasma, and the antioxidant concentrations of each were assessed. Samples also were screened for phorbol ester-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. SETTING: Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Clinical Biochemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland.
