The multivariable hazard ratio of total stroke comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of dietary TAC was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.99; P for trend=0.04) in CVD-free women. Among women with a CVD history, the hazard ratios for the highest versus lowest quartile of TAC were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.75-1.07; P for trend=0.30) for total stroke and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.32-0.95; P for trend=0.03) for hemorrhagic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dietary TAC is inversely associated with total stroke among CVD-free women and hemorrhagic stroke among women with CVD history.
