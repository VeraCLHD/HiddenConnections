When the percent composition of the particles was determined, both VLDL and LDL had a higher proportion of cholesterol. Turnover studies indicated that the FCRs for radiolabelled VLDL and LDL were reduced in casein-fed animals compared to those fed soy protein. The elevated LDL levels in casein-fed rabbits were primarily due to a reduction in receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL-apo B. Receptor-independent removal in the two groups was similar.
