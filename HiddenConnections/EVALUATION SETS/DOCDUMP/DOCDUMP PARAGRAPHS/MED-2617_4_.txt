Overall, a similar amount of energy was consumed on all three test days indicating that participants compensated for the 173 and 259 kcals consumed as almonds on the 28 and 42 g test days, respectively.

However, in the interval between lunch and dinner, appetite ratings were not dependent on the mid-morning snack.
