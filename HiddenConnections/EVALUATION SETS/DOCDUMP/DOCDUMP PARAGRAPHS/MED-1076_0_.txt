Abstract To quantify objectionable levels of connective tissues, restructured beef products were made with 2·5 and 5% added tendon; 5 and 10% added epimysium, gristle, or peri/endomysium; and a control. Initial tenderness (IT), residual connective tissue (CT), and overall texture (OT) were evaluated by a sensory panel. Panelists adversely scored IT, CT, and OT for 2·5 and 5% tendon and CT and OT for 10% epimysium and gristle.
