HL was associated with gasoline station occupation (HR=4.59, 95% CI 1.08 to 19.6). CONCLUSION: The findings in this current study of a higher risk of NHL among car repair workers and butchers and a higher risk of HL among gasoline station workers suggest a possible role from occupationally related exposures, such as solvents and zoonotic viruses, as risk factors for malignant lymphoma.
