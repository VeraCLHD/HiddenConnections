Abstract OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the reduced life expectancy for six types of potentially preventable cancer in the United States. METHODS: A total of 1,579,310 patients diagnosed with cancers of the lung, colon and rectum, liver, breast, cervix, or prostate in 1992-2005 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. The lifetime survival functions for the cancer cohort and age-/sex-matched reference population were generated using a semi-parametric extrapolation method with annual life tables.
