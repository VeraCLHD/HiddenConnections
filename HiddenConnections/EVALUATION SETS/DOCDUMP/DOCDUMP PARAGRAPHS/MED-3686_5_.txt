Western blot analysis showed that sodium palmitate activated GSK-3β protein, which was indicated by dephosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9. However, inhibition of GSK-3β activity with lithium chloride treatment or knockdown of GSK-3β expression with shRNA suppressed sodium palmitate-induced lipoapoptosis in L02 and HepG2 cells. On a molecular level, inhibition of GSK-3β expression or activity suppressed sodium palmitate-induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and Bax upregulation, whereas GSK-3β inhibition did not affect endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced activation of unfolded protein response.
