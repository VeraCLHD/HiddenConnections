Women suffered from constipation more frequently than men (82.4% vs 61.9 %). In 33 patients out of 74 (44.6 %), onset of constipation preceded motor disturbance by an average time of 18.1+/-18.8 years. Furthermore, the amount of water intake correlated inversely with the severity of constipation and the depletion of water intake preceded constipation in most cases.
