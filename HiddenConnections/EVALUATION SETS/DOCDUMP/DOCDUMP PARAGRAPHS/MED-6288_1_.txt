The effects of VEGF and PRE were examined by in vitro tube formation assays and following 14-day co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts. The antiangiogenic mechanism of PRE was evaluated by VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of HUVECs and/or human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38. The PRE significantly suppressed VEGF-induced tube formation, proliferation and migration in HUVECs and HRMECs as well as phosphorylation of ERK and p38.
