When vessels are exposed to high P conditions in vitro, they develop apoptosis, convert to bone-like cells and develop extensive calcification. Clinical studies in children on dialysis show that high P is associated with increased vessel wall thickness, arterial stiffness and coronary calcification. Epidemiological studies in adult dialysis patients demonstrate a significant and independent association between raised P and mortality.
