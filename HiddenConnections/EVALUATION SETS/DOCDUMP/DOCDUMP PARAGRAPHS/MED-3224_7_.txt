Preliminary data suggest that statins that are less lipophilic (ie, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) may be less likely to contribute to cognitive impairment due to limited penetration across the blood-brain barrier. These drugs would be a logical alternative in cases where cognitive impairment secondary to another statin is suspected. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several reports of statin-associated cognitive impairment, this adverse effect remains a rare occurrence among the totality of the literature.
