Consumer panels detected increased aroma (chicken meaty and warmed-over aromas) and flavor (chicken meaty and warmed-over flavors) in not bled samples at 24 h PM. By 72 h PM, however, there were no significant differences in aroma or flavor. Therefore, different slaughter and bleeding method may affect color and sensory properties of the broiler breast fillets, and the ES and decapitation method had the most favorable results for sensory quality.
