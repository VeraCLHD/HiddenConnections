This led to the prevailing opinion that exposure of humans to BLV and/or the potential for infection are not significant and therefore the virus is not a public health hazard. We reexamined this issue using more sensitive immunological techniques available today. Using immunoblotting to test the sera of 257 humans for antibodies of four isotypes (IgG1, IgM, IgA, and IgG4) to the BLV capsid antigen (p24), we detected at least one antibody isotype reactive with BLV in 74% of the human sera tested.
