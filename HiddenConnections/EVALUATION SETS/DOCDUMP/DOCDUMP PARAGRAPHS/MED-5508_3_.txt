We used logistic regression to calculate multivariate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of taking multivitamin supplements for various lifestyle, clinical and dietary factors. RESULTS: Overall, 36% of men reported current multivitamin use. Men who were older, current smokers, and currently using aspirin were 143, 43, and 74% more likely to use multivitamins only.
