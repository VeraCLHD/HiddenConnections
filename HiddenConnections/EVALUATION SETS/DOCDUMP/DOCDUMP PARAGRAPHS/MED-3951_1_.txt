Although cholesterol crystals (CCs) have been observed in plaques, their role in PD was unknown. However, cholesterol expands with crystallization tearing and perforating fibrous tissues. This study tested the hypothesis that CCs can damage plaques and intima, triggering PD, as observed in tissues prepared without ethanol solvents that dissolve CCs.
