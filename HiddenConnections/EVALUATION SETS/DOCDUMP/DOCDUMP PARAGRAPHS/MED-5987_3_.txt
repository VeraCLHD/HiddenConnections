Coronary-artery fatty streaks were correlated with very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.41, P = 0.04). Mean systolic blood-pressure levels also tended to be higher in the four subjects with coronary-artery fibrous plaques than in those without them: 112 mm Hg as compared with 104 (P = 0.09). These results document the importance of risk-factor levels to early anatomical changes in the aorta and coronary arteries.
