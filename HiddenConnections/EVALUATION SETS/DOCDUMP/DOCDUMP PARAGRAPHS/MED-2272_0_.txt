Abstract BACKGROUND: Higher intake of carbohydrates and high-glycemic index (high-GI) diets could lead to small vessel dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the associations between intakes of high-GI and high-glycemic load (high-GL) diets, carbohydrate, and the main carbohydrate-containing food groups and retinal microvascular changes in preadolescents. DESIGN: Students aged 12 y (n = 2353) from a random cluster sample of 21 schools underwent detailed eye examinations.
