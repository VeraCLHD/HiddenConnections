The odds ratios for the two factors - children consuming more than 200 mL of cows milk per day (25 children in group I, 11 children in group II) and breastfeeding for less than 4 months (16 children in group I, 5 children in group II) - were calculated to be 8.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23-0.74, P = 0.0005) and 5.7 (95% CI: 0.37-0.66, P = 0.007), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Infants and young children with chronic constipation and anal fissure may consume larger amounts of cows milk than children with a normal bowel habit. Additionally, shorter duration of breastfeeding and early bottle feeding with cows milk may play a role in the development of constipation and anal fissure in infants and young children.
