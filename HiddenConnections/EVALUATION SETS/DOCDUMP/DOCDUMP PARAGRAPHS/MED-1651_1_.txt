Patients frequently associate these symptoms with excessive intestinal gas and the reduction of gas production may represent an effective strategy. The aim was to evaluate the effect of alpha-galactosidase administration, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled protocol, on intestinal gas production and gas-related symptoms after a challenge test meal in healthy volunteers. Eight healthy volunteers ingested 300 or 1200 GalU of alpha-galactosidase or placebo during a test meal containing 420 g of cooked beans.
