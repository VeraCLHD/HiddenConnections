Curcumin was administered orally at a dose of 375 mg/3 times/day orally for a period of 6-22 months in eight patients. They were followed up for a period of 2 years at 3 monthly intervals. Five patients completed the study, out of which four recovered completely and in one patient the swelling regressed completely but some limitation of movement persisted.
