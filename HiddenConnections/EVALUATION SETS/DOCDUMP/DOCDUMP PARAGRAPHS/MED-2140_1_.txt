The noncovalent binding of the inhibitory flavonoids to alpha-synuclein and the covalent modification by the flavonoid quinone led to the restriction of the conformational changes in this natively unfolded protein and to the stabilization of soluble flavonoid-modified species of alpha-synuclein (monomers and oligomers). All of these factors rather than a single one contribute to the inhibition of WT alpha-synuclein fibrillation induced by the flavonoid. The structural requirements that appear necessary to provide a flavonoid the ability to inhibit alpha-synuclein fibrillation were determined to be vicinal dihydroxyphenyl moieties, irrespective of the ring position where they are located.
