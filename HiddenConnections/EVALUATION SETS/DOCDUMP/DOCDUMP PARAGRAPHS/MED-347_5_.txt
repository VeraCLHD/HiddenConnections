The CFVR ratio was defined as the ratio of CFVR after beverage consumption to CFVR before beverage consumption. All data were divided into 2 groups according to beverage type: group T (black tea) and group C (caffeine). Two-way analysis of variance showed a significant group effect and interaction in CFVR before and after beverage consumption (p = 0.001).
