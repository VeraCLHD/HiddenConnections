No correlation was found between the two, and neither the rates of clearance of food particles from the teeth nor the rates of clearance of food-derived sugars from the saliva correlated with ratings of food stickiness. Cookies, crackers, and potato chips were most retentive, whereas caramels, jelly beans, raisins, and milk chocolate bars were among those poorly retained. Clearance rates appeared to vary inversely with initial retention.
