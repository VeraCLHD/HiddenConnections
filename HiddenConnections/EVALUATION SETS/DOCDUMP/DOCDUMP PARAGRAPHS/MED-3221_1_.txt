Then follows a survey of the role of neuronal membrane cholesterol in Abeta pore formation and Abeta fibrillogenesis, together with the link with membrane raft domains and gangliosides. The contribution of structural studies to Abeta fibrillogenesis, using TEM and AFM, is given some emphasis. The role of apolipoprotein E and its isoforms, in particular ApoE4, in cholesterol and Abeta binding is presented, in relation to genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.
