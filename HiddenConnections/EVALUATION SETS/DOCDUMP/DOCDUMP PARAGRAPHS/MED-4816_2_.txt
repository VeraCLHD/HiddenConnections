We therefore tested the ability of SFN to perform this role in lens cells and establish its ability to delay the onset of cataract. METHODS: The human lens epithelial cell line FHL124 and whole porcine lens culture systems were used. The ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay was used to assess FHL124 cell survival, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis.
