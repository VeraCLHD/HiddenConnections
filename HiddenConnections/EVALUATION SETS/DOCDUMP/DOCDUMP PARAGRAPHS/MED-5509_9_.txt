These trials were pooled in a meta-analysis, and the outcomes were expressed as RRs and 95% CIs. RESULTS: The average age of the pooled sample was 62 y, and the average duration of supplementation was 43 mo. Across all studies, no effect of multivitamin-multimineral treatment on all-cause mortality (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.02) was observed.
