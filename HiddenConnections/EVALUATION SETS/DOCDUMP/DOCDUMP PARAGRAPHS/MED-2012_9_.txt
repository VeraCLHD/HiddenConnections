Given patterns found in day 1 and the subsequent decline to lower levels in day 2, we hypothesize that BPA exposures in these individuals were diet-driven. No events in the diary (use of personal care products, e.g.) appear associated with exposures. On day 2, non-dietary sources may still be present, such as from dust.
