Risk genes are indicated in other chromosomes of the human genome, suggesting a complex interaction between genes and environment as the cause of the disease. The pathogenesis of the disease is proposed to be autoimmune in nature and environmental risk factors may either initiate autoimmunity or accelerate an already ongoing beta-cell destruction. Risk factors disclosed by epidemiological studies that may accelerate the pathogenetic process are: a cold environment, a high growth rate, infections and stressful life events.
