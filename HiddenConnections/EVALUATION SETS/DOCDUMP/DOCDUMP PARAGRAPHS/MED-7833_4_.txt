Ever having owned dogs and/or cats was associated with reduced risk of all NHL (OR=0.71,CI=0.54–0.94) and of DLCL (OR=0.60,CI=0.42–0.86). Longer duration of cat ownership (p-trend=0.008), dog ownership (p-trend=0.04), and dog and/or cat ownership (p-trend =0.004) was inversely associated with risk of NHL. Ownership of pets other than cats and dogs was associated with a reduced risk of NHL (OR=0.64,CI=0.55–0.74) and DLCL (OR=0.58,CI=0.47 –0.71).
