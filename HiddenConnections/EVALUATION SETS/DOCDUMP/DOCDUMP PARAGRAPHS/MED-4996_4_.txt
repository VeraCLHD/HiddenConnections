Microsatellite instability is present in 15% of colorectal cancers, and is diagnosed by analysis of tumor DNA from paraffin blocks and by demonstration of loss of mismatch repair protein expression in cancers. In addition to the unique profile of genetic alterations, colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability have distinct pathologic features and improved survival. Finally, cancers from most patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (or Lynch syndrome) have microsatellite instability due to germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes.
