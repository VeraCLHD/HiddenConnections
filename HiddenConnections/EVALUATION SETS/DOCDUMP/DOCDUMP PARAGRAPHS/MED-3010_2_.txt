Although RCTs present one approach toward understanding the efficacy of nutrient interventions, the innate complexities of nutrient actions and interactions cannot always be adequately addressed through any single research design.

This may mean action at a level of certainty that is different from what would be needed in the evaluation of drug efficacy.
