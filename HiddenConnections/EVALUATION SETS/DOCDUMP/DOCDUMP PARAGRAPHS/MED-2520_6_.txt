In contrast, the DCM fraction exhibited slightly effect on MMPs secretion and had no effect on MMPs activity. Collagenase activity was significantly inhibited by the Hex and DCM fractions. High amounts of γ-oryzanol and γ-tocotrienol were found in the Hex and DCM fractions and demonstrated an anti-invasion property.
