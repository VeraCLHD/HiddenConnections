The nitrate content in plants also depends upon other factors, such as plant variety (cultivar), kind and amount of fertiliser, time of harvest and environmental factors such as light intensity, temperature, etc. It is suggested that we should try to meet the recommendations of toxicologists who believe a dramatic reduction nitrate intake for humans is necessary. It has been demonstrated that modern biological-organic farming methods clearly lead both to lower leaching of nitrates and to lower nitrate content in vegetables.
