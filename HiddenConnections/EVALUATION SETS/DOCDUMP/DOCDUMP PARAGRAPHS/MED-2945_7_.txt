MEASUREMENTS: Midlife blood pressure and total cholesterol level, apoE genotype, and development of Alzheimer disease during follow-up. RESULTS: The apoE epsilon4 allele was an independent risk factor for Alzheimer disease, even after adjustment for midlife vascular risk factors and other confounders (odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.1 to 4.1]). Similarly, elevated midlife values for serum total cholesterol level (odds ratio, 2.8 [CI, 1.2 to 6.7]) and systolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 2.6 [CI, 1.1 to 6.6]) were independent risk factors for Alzheimer disease, even after adjustment for apoE genotype and other confounding factors.
