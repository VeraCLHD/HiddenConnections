Abstract Using a panel of chemical, biochemical, and cell assays, we determined inhibitory effects of extracts of the pigmented black rice brans on in vitro allergic reactions. Ethanol-water (70% v/v) extracts from 5 pigmented brans were found to be more effective than an extract from a nonpigmented rice cultivar in suppressing the release of histamine and beta-hexosaminidase from basophilic RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with both Ionophore A23187 and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-antigen complexes. Suppression was also obtained with A23187-stimulated rat peritoneal mast cells.
