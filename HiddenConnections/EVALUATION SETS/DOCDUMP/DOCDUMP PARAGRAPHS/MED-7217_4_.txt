During 1 week before and after nitrate intake a diet low in nitrate was consumed. Using the same protocol, the effect of two different doses of ascorbic acid (250 mg and 1 g/day) and two different doses of green tea (2 g and 4 g/day) on formation of NDMA and NPIP was studied. Mean nitrate excretion in urine significantly increased from control (76+/-24) to 167+/-25 mg/24 h. Intake of nitrate and fish resulted in a significant increase in mean urinary excretion of NDMA compared with the control weeks: 871+/-430 and 640+/-277 ng/24 h during days 1-3 and 4-7, respectively, compared with 385+/-196 ng/24 h (p<0.0002).
