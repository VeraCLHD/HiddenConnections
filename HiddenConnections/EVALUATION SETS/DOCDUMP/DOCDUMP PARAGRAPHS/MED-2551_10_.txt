This was more marked in the MZ pairs (37.1 vs. 25.3 pack-years, p = 0.077) than in the DZ pairs (28.6 vs. 20.5 pack-years, p = 0.17). A similar relationship was seen when smoking dose was calculated only until 10 years before PD onset, suggesting that the lower dose of smoking in the twin with PD was not the result of early, undiagnosed disease. CONCLUSION: Within twin pairs, risk of PD is inversely correlated with the dose (in pack-years) of cigarette smoking.
