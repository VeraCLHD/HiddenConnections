Subjects were found to be predominantly normotensive (43.5%) or prehypertensive (50.6%) and quite physically active (>30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity/day in >80% subjects). No significant differences were seen for BP or any of the other markers, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance. In conclusion, in this hypercholesterolemic, nonhypertensive group, no beneficial effects on BP or other markers of cardiovascular function were seen when consuming 2 kiwifruit a day against the background of a healthy diet.
