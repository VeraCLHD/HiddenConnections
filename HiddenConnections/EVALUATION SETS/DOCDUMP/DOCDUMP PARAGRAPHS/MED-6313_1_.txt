The lentils produced a significant 71% (p less than 0.001) reduction in the blood glucose area and flattened the plasma insulin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses by comparison with the bread. In addition, the lentil breakfast was followed by a significantly flatter blood glucose response to the standard bread lunch which followed 4 h later (by 38%, p less than 0.01). The blood glucose pattern was mimicked by feeding the bread breakfast slowly over the 4 h before lunch.
