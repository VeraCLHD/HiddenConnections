Abstract BACKGROUND: Elevated serum saturated fatty acid levels and hepatocyte lipoapoptosis are features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate saturated fatty acid induction of lipoapoptosis in human liver cells and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Human liver L02 and HepG2 cells were treated with sodium palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, for up to 48 h with or without lithium chloride, a glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor, or GSK-3β shRNA transfection.
