Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between circulating 25(OH)D and survival. RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the women died during follow-up, with 95% of deaths resulting from ovarian cancer. Circulating 25(OH)D concentrations (mean: 44 nmol/L) were significantly associated with age, state of residence, season of blood collection, and body mass index but not with tumor histology, stage or grade, or comorbidities.
