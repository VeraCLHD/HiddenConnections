The patients who participated in the clinical trial differed significantly from other RA patients. Firstly, they had a higher internal score and a lower chance score on the Multi-dimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLCS). Secondly, their belief in the effect of ordinary medical treatment, evaluated by a 10-cm visual analogue scale, was lower, and their belief in the effect of 'alternative', unconventional forms of treatment was higher.
