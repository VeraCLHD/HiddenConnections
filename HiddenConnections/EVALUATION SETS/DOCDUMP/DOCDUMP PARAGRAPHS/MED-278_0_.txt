Abstract This article outlines the advantages and disadvantages of universal and targeted intervention programs. Two advantages of universal programs are the absence of labeling and stigmatization, and the inclusion of the middle class which makes it more likely that the program will be well run. Two disadvantages are that they are unappealing to the public and politicians, and they may have their greatest effect on those at lowest risk.
