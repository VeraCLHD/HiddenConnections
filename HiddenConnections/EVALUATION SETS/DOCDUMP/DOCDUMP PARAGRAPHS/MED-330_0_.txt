Abstract Hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and obesity are independent risk factors for coronary artery disease and are often found in the same person. This study investigated the effects of an intensive, 3-week, dietary and exercise program on these risk factors. The group was divided into diabetic patients (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM], n = 13), insulin-resistant persons (n = 29) and those with normal insulin, less than or equal to 10 microU/ml (n = 30).
