A dose-related reduction of URI risk according to the quartiles of intake was found in the 3-month (p for trend = 0.03) but not the 5-month follow-up. No association was found between either fruit or vegetable intake alone in relation to the 5-month or the 3-month risk of URI. Conclusions Women who consume more fruits and vegetables have a moderate reduction in risk of URI during pregnancy, and this benefit appears to be derived from both fruits and vegetables, instead of either alone.
