Daily faecal output was 127 +/- 70 g and transit time 47 +/- 19 h. Analysis of faecal samples found 0.8 +/- 1.2 g RS and significant relationship with the concentration (mmol/L) of butyrate excreted n faeces (r = 0.34, P < 0.05). Dietary intake of RS was associated with higher concentrations of faecal ammonia (r = 0.34, P < 0.05), but this association was reversed when RS was combined with NSP in the diet (r = 0.07, NS). In contrast to dietary intake, the faecal excretion of RS was negatively related to faecal ammonia concentration (r = -0.40, P < 0.01) and positively related to faecal output (r = 0.64, P < 0.01).
