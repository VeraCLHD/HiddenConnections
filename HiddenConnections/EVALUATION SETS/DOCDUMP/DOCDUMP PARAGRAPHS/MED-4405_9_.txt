Significant temporospatial variations in the presence and abundance of histologic disc alterations were observed across levels, regions, macroscopic degeneration grades, and age groups. A practicable classification system for age-related histologic disc alterations was developed, resulting in moderate to excellent reliability (kappa values, 0.49-0.98) depending on the histologic variable. Application of the classification system to cadaveric and surgical specimens demonstrated a significant correlation with age ( < 0.0001) and macroscopic grade of degeneration ( < 0001).
