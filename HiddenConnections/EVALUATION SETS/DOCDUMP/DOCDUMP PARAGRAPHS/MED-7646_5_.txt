Scores on 2 previously defined empirical dietary patterns were also computed for each participant. Results After adjustment for age, other demographics, lifestyle factors, and intakes of other foods or beverages, only processed meat intake was associated with telomere length. For every 1 serving/d greater intake of processed meat, the T/S ratio was 0.07 smaller (β ± SE: −0.07 ± 0.03, P = 0.006).
