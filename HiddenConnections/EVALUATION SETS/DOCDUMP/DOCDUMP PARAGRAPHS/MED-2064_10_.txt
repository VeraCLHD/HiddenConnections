A radioimmunoassay using anti-H-25 and 3H-8-PN was established and used for the quantitative determination of 8-PN in various beer brands and in the urine of six men after the consumption of three different brands of beer. Furthermore, the dose-dependent excretion of 8-PN was tested after the consumption of a higher volume of a single beer brand with and without spiking with 8-PN and a small oral dose of authentic 8-PN, respectively. Conflicting results led to a pilot test on the in vivo conversion (demethylation) of IX into 8-PN in two men.
