Abstract Background Prostate cancer (PC) incidence and progression may be influenced by dietary factors, but little is known about the acceptability of dietary modification to men at increased risk of PC. Qualitative interviews with men participating in the ProDiet study were undertaken to explore the feasibility of implementing dietary interventions for the prevention of prostate cancer. Methods An interview study nested within the ProDiet randomised feasibility trial of dietary interventions to prevent a PC diagnosis.
