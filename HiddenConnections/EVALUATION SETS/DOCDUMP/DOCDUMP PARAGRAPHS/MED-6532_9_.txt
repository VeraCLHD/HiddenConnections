The hazard ratio for the association between DM and benign proliferative breast disease was 1.09 (95%CI, 0.98â€“1.23). Risk varied by levels of baseline total vitamin D intake but it varied little by levels of other baseline variables. These results suggest that a modest reduction in fat intake and increase in fruit, vegetable, and grain intake does not alter the risk of benign proliferative breast disease.
