Four were defined as the strongly adhesive strains (more than 40 bacteria adhering to one Caco-2 cell), and 2 as the adhesive strains (5-40 bacteria adhering to one Caco-2 cell). Five strains grew and acidified chemically defined medium with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) as the only carbon source. End-products of FOS fermentation were found.
