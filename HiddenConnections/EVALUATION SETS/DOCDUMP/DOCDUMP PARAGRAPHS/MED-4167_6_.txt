Unfortunately, the microbiota may also elaborate toxic products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulfide by sulfur-reducing bacteria in response to a high-meat diet. The employment of culture-free techniques based on 16S regions of DNA has revealed that our colons harbor over 800 bacterial species and 7000 different strains. Evidence suggests that the diet directly influences the diversity of the microbiota, providing the link between diet, colonic disease, and colon cancer.
