MATERIAL AND METHOD: Caco-2 cells were exposed to Cd in boiled pig kidney, ark shell, kale, raw kale, mixed boiled pig kidney with raw kale and CdCl2 after in vitro digestion. Then cellular Cd uptake from the digests and reference CdCl2 solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. RESULTS: Cd bioavailability from animal-based foods was higher than that from vegetable-based foods.
