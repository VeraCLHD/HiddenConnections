The mean Physical Development Index (PDI) scores of these two groups were 102.2 +/- 10.5 and 95.4 +/- 13.2 respectively at 6 months and 98.0 +/- 5.8 and 86.7 +/- 11.1 respectively at 1 year. By repeated measures ANOVA, significant differences existed between groups for MDI and PDI (p = 0.020 and 0.008). However, there were no differences in visual acuity, physical examination variables or vital signs between these two groups.
