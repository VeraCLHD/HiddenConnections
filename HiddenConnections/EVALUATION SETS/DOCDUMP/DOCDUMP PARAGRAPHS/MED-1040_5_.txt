Physical examination, demographic, biochemical and anthropometry parameters were recorded, and the saRHI was measured in each patient. Individuals in the lowest LCDS quartile (Q1, 45 % carbohydrate; 20 % protein; 32 % fat) had higher saRHI values than those in the top quartile (Q4, 29 % carbohydrate, 24 % protein, 40 % fat; 1.66 (sd 0.41) v. 1.52 (sd 0.22), P= 0.037). These results were particularly strong in patients with the MS (Q1 = 1.82 (sd 0.32) v. Q4 = 1.61 (sd 027); P= 0.021) and T2D (Q1 = 1.78 (sd 0.31) v. Q4 = 1.62 (sd 0.35); P= 0.011).
