If the serum total cholesterol level can be prevented from rising to more than 150 mg/dl, plaques are not laid down; if elevated levels are lowered to 150 mg/dl, further plaque does not form, and parts of those present may vanish.

Lipid-lowering drugs are required in the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and in most patients with atherosclerotic events.
