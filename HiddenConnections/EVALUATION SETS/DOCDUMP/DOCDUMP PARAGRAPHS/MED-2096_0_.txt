Abstract BACKGROUND: The role of nutritional influences on bone health remains largely undefined because most studies have focused attention on calcium intake. OBJECTIVE: We reported previously that intakes of nutrients found in abundance in fruit and vegetables are positively associated with bone health. We examined this finding further by considering axial and peripheral bone mass and markers of bone metabolism.
