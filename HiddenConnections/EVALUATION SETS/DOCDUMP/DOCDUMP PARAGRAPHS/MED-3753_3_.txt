Serum chemistry and 24-hour urine samples collected at the end of each phase were compared using mixed model repeated measures analysis. RESULTS: Serum and urinary uric acid were increased for each phase. Beef was associated with lower serum uric acid than chicken or fish (6.5 vs 7.0 and 7.3 mg/dl, respectively, each p <0.05).
