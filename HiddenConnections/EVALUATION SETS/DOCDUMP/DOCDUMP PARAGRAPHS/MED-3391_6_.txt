After intense cooking, on the other hand, a considerable amount of all-E-β-carotene could be released from cell fragments (smaller than a cell) as well as from small and large cell clusters. Hence, the importance of mechanical breakdown, and thus also of (in vitro) mastication, is dependent on the carrot sample that is considered (i.e., the extent to which the carrot sample has been thermally processed prior to the particle size reduction). Structural changes occurring during mechanical and thermal processing are hereby key factors determining the all-E-β-carotene bioaccessibility.
