Abstract Significance: Ewan Cameron reported that ascorbate, given orally and intravenously at doses of up to 10â€‰g/day, was effective in the treatment of cancer. Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment. However, the route of administration results in major differences in ascorbate bioavailability.
