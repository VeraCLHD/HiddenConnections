CONCLUSIONS: The combination of RS and NSP in the colon may be required to achieve an optimal luminal environment conducive to 'colonic health'. The results also support the suggestion that faecal output (< or > 150 g/d) may provide a useful index of colon cancer risk. High faecal outputs are achieved through higher intakes of NSP (the major component of dietary fibre).
