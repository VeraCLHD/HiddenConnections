OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of an LBD versus a control diet in preventing the occurrence of infection and to decrease (infection-related) mortality in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia. Secondary objectives were to assess the time to first febrile episode, the need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 2011), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 2011), PubMed (from 1946 to 20 October 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 20 October 2011) and CINAHL (from 1981 to 20 October 2011).
