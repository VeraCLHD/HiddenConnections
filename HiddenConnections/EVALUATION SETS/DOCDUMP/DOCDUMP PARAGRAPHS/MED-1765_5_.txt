We tested for association between survival and 25-OHD, VDR genotype/haplotype, and after applying a VDR genotype-25-OHD interaction term. We conducted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: We found strong associations between plasma 25-OHD concentration and CRC-specific (P = .008) and all-cause mortality (P = .003).
