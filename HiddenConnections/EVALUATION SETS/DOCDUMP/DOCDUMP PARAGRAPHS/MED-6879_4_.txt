The nasal passages of 35 hog producers were sampled and total DNA was extracted from the calcium-alginate swabs to detect, by PCR, Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, Y. enterocolitica, tetA/tetC, tetG and ribosomal protection protein genes. Airborne culturable C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli, and Y. enterocolitica were present in the bioaerosols of 16, 17, 11 and 6 of the 18 facilities. Aerosolized total (culturable/non culturable) Campylobacter, C. perfringens, Enterococcus, E. coli and Y. enterocolitica were detected in 10, 6, 15, 18 and 2 barns, respectively.
