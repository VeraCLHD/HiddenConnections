In contrast, an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was noted (0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.13) with the random-effect model. The analysis showed a significant change in BGL (-2.58 mmol/L, 95% CI -3.22 to -1.84) with high heterogeneity between (I(2) = 97%) and across (Ï„(2) = 5.88) the studies. The fixed-effect model showed a significant change in TC, low-density lipoprotein, and BGL, whereas it showed no significant changes in high-density lipoprotein and TGL/TAG.
