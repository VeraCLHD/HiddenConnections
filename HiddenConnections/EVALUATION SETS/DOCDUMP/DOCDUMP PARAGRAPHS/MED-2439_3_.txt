All trials followed the same protocol: a standardized meal the evening prior to testing, an overnight fast ( 1 10 h) and 2-hour glucose testing following consumption of a bagel and juice test meal (3 trials) or dextrose solution (1 trial). For each trial, PPG was compared between treatments using area-under-the-curve calculations 120 min after the meal. RESULTS: Two teaspoons of vinegar ( 10 g) effectively reduced PPG, and this effect was most pronounced when vinegar was ingested during mealtime as compared to 5 h before the meal.
