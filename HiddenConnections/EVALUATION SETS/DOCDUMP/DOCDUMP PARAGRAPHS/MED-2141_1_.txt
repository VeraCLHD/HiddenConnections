We tested the hypothesis that individuals with skin cancer (non-melanoma skin cancer and cutaneous malignant melanoma) have less myocardial infarction, hip fracture and death from any cause, compared with general population controls. METHODS: We examined the entire Danish population above age 40 years from 1980 through 2006, comprising 4.4 million individuals. Diagnoses of non-melanoma skin cancer (n=129,206), cutaneous malignant melanoma (n=22,107), myocardial infarction (n=327,856), hip fracture (n=129,419), and deaths from any cause (n=1,629,519) were drawn from national registries.
