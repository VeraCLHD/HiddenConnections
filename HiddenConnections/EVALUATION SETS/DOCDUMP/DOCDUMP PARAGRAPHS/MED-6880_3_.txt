The detection rate of RT-PCR was significantly higher than culture method and a higher incidence in autumn-winter was also noticeably identified than in spring-summer. Infection sources mostly focused on unboiled foods (101) and pets (45), while clinical manifestation mainly presented as gastroenteritis (156), pseudoappendicitis (32), and extraintestinal complications (46). The morbidity of extraintestinal complications in adults was significantly higher than in children and it was the same for high-risk patients between adults over the age of 60 years (4.7%) and children under the age of 3 years (1.4%), whereas the constituent ratio of children versus adults with yersiniosis in different systems was not significant.
