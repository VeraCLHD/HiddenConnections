Post meal carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (P=0.07), augmentation index (P=0.63), small artery elasticity index (P=0.98) and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.13) were not significantly altered by spinach relative to control. Therefore, consumption of a nitrate-rich meal can lower systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure and increase large artery compliance acutely in healthy men and women. If sustained, these effects could contribute to better cardiovascular health.
