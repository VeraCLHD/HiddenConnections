The mean changes in FMD (95% CIs) compared with placebo were 0.1% (-0.9%, 1.1%), -0.3% (-1.3%, 0.6%), and -0.3% (-1.3%, 0.7%) with daily intakes of 0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs, respectively. No significant treatment effects were noted for arterial stiffness and central mean or 24-h ambulatory blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Intakes of n-3 LC-PUFAs â‰¤1.8 g/d do not improve endothelial function in healthy adults.
