A mixed meal accompanied by either water, RW or DRW was consumed on three separate visits, in random order, 2 weeks apart. One fasting and 6 hourly postprandial blood samples were taken for lipid analysis. Results showed no significant quantitative changes in postprandial apolipoprotein (apo) B48 levels following the consumption of DRW or RW compared to water.
