FA values were expressed as a percent of total identified FA. RESULTS: Compared to men, women generally had higher C18 trans levels, and between the ages of 10-29 years, they had DHA and lower EPA levels. Among the major FA classes, saturated (41% of total) and trans (âˆ¼0.85%) fats did not vary appreciably by age, whereas monounsaturated fats tended to rise slightly.
