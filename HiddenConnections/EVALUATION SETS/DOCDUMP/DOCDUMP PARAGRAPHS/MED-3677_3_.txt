Western diets rich in saturated fats cause obesity and insulin resistance, and increase levels of circulating NEFAs [non-esterified ('free') fatty acids]. In addition, they contribute to beta-cell failure in genetically predisposed individuals. NEFAs cause beta-cell apoptosis and may thus contribute to progressive beta-cell loss in Type 2 diabetes.
