These two components, with water-soluble material in the stool, comprise 98.3 +/- 0.9% of faecal solids. The purity of the microbial fraction was demonstrated by Gram and plant stains and by scanning electron microscopy. Microscopic counts of the bacteria in each fraction of the stool showed that the microbial fraction contained 95% of the total bacteria.
