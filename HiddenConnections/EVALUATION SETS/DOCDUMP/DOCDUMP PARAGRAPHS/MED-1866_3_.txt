METHODS: HT-29 colon carcinoma cells (standard medium or medium lacking serum) were treated with sodium butyrate (NaBu), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or both. Northern blot analyses were performed with cDNA probes specific for c-fos, c-jun, and actin. Cell growth was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation.
