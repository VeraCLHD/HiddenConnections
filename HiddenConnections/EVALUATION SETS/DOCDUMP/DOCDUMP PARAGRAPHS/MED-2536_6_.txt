Phthalates are metabolized and excreted quickly in the body with metabolites measured in urine. Phthalates, which are known endocrine disrupting compounds, have been associated with oxidative stress and alterations in cytokine expression. Metabolites in human urine, particularly of the higher-molecular-weight phthalates, have been associated with allergies and asthma in multiple studies.
