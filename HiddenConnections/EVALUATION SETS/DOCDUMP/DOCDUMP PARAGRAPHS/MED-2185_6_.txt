Moreover, vitamin D supplementation (800 IU/d) in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20%. Such a dose will bring serum levels of 25OHD above 20 ng/mL in nearly all postmenopausal women. Based on calculations of the metabolic clearance of 25OHD, a daily intake of 500-700 IU of vitamin D3 is sufficient to maintain serum 25OHD levels of 20 ng/mL.
