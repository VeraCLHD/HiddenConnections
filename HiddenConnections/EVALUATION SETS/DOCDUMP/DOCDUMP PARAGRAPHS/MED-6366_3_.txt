TEM data were elaborated by means of a mathematical formula based on a Bayesian technique able to furnish a fertility index (FI), and the percentages of sperm apoptosis, necrosis, and immaturity. Values of normality recommended by World Health Organization guidelines were used as a control for conventional semen analysis, and values from sperm of 25 men of proven fertility were used for TEM indices. Infertile smoker and nonsmoker patients showed similar sperm parameters, although sperm motility and TEM analysis values in both groups were significantly impaired compared with controls.
