For never-smokers, the corresponding HRs were 1.99 (95% CI, 1.12-3.52; P(trend)=0.03), 2.22 (95% CI, 1.20-4.08; P(trend)=0.01), and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.80-1.52; P(trend)=0.55). CONCLUSIONS: We observed increased risks of postmenopausal endometrial and ovarian cancer with increasing dietary acrylamide intake, particularly among never-smokers. Risk of breast cancer was not associated with acrylamide intake.
