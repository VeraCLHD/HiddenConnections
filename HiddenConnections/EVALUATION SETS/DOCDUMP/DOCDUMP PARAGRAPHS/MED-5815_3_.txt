Therefore, phosphate additives in food are a matter of concern, and their potential impact on health may well have been underappreciated. Methods We reviewed pertinent literature retrieved by a selective search of the PubMed and EU databases (www.zusatzstoffe-online.de, www.codexalimentarius.de), with the search terms “phosphate additives” and “hyperphosphatemia.” Results There is no need to lower the content of natural phosphate, i.e. organic esters, in food, because this type of phosphate is incompletely absorbed; restricting its intake might even lead to protein malnutrition.
