More than half of respondents (57%) report implementing the neutropenic diet at their facility. In a multivariate analysis, being a stem cell transplant (SCT) center was the only significant factor associated with implementing a neutropenic diet (OR: 6.06, 95% CI, 2.88-12.738, P < 0.001) after controlling for years in practice, gender, center size, and academic versus private practice. Among physicians who implemented a neutropenic diet, absolute neutrophil count was the trigger for initiating the diet in oncology patients (72%) while admission and start of preparative regimen was used for SCT patients (84%).
