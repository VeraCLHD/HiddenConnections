In two individual studies no statistically significant difference in infection rate between the intervention and control diet was identified; another study showed no significant difference in the number of chemotherapy cycles with an infection between the treatment groups. None of the studies mentioned infection-related mortality, but in one study no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups was observed. Time from onset of neutropenia to fever, the duration of empirical antibiotics and antimycotics, diet acceptability (i.e. following the diet easily and following the diet throughout all chemotherapy cycles) and quality of life were all evaluated by only one study; for all outcomes no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms was observed.
