The level of consumption of purine-rich vegetables and the total protein intake were not associated with an increased risk of gout. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are associated with an increased risk of gout, whereas a higher level of consumption of dairy products is associated with a decreased risk. Moderate intake of purine-rich vegetables or protein is not associated with an increased risk of gout.
