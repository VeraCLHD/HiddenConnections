Two-sided P<0.05 were defined as the level of significance. RESULTS: Serum GGT, AST and ALT levels showed interactions (P<0.05) between the beverage groups and time; the others were not affected. The PSP beverage group showed lower hepatic marker levels than the placebo group during the ingestion period, particularly the GGT level (-14.1 IU/l, 95% Confidence intervel (CI) -25.4 to -2.7, P=0.017 at 2 weeks; -16.8 IU/l, 95% CI -36.2 to 2.5, P=0.081 at 4 weeks; -26.7 IU/l, 95% CI -47.6 to -5.7, P=0.014 at 6 weeks and -27.9 IU/l, 95% CI -49.9 to -5.9; P=0.014 at 8 weeks).
