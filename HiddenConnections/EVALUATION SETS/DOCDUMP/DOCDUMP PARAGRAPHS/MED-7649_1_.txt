Breaking force and deformation of gels increased with increasing MTGase amount added (P<0.05). At the same MTGase level used, gels with the prior setting at 40 degrees C for 30 min showed a higher breaking force compared with those subjected to prior setting at 25 degrees C for 2 h (P<0.05). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic study revealed that myosin heavy chain (MHC) underwent polymerization to a higher extent in the presence of MTGase.
