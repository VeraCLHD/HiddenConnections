Our prospective cohort study included 63,805 participants in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (from 1993â€“2010) who completed a food frequency questionnaire at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards models were fit using person-years as the underlying time metric. We estimated multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death associated with increasing quintiles of diet quality index scores.
