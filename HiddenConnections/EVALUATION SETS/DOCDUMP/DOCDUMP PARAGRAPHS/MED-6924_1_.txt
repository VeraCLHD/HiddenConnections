Pesticide use is prevalent in the production of edible bamboo shoots, which are exported widely from China. To evaluate the quality of Chinese bamboo shoots we determined the residual content of some OCPs in shoot samples. RESULTS: Three types of OCPs-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), 1,1,1-trichlor-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB)-were detected in bamboo shoots from Zhejiang province, China.
