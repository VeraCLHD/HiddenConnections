Abstract FAS-associated protein with death domain (FADD) is the key adaptor protein transmitting apoptotic signals mediated by the main death receptors (DRs). Besides being an essential instrument in cell death, FADD is also implicated in proliferation, cell cycle progression, tumor development, inflammation, innate immunity, and autophagy. Recently, many of these new functions of FADD were shown to be independent of DRs. Moreover, FADD function is dictated by protein localization and phosphorylation state.
