Participants Forty-eight healthy adolescent females ranging from lean to obese recruited for a healthy weight maintenance trial. Main Outcome Measure The relation between elevated “food addiction” scores and blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI activation in response to receipt and anticipated receipt of palatable food (chocolate milkshake). Results Food addiction scores (N = 39) correlated with greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and amygdala in response to anticipated receipt of food (P <0.05, false-discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons in small volumes).
