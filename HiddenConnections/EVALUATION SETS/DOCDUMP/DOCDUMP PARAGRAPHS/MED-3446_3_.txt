FFA also produces low-grade inflammation in skeletal muscle and liver through activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, resulting in release of several proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines. Thus, elevated FFA levels (due to obesity or to high-fat feeding) cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver, which contributes to the development of T2DM, and produce low-grade inflammation, which contributes to the development of atherosclerotic vascular diseases and NAFLD.
