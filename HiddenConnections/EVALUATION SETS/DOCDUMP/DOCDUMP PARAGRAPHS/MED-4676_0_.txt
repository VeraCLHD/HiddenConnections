Abstract Background Telomere length reflects biological aging and may be influenced by environmental factors, including those that affect inflammatory processes. Objective With data from 840 white, black, and Hispanic adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we studied cross-sectional associations between telomere length and dietary patterns and foods and beverages that were associated with markers of inflammation. Design Leukocyte telomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
