At 3 mo, 25(OH)D and free 25(OH)D remained significantly lower (20% and 30%, respectively; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D decrease after an inflammatory insult and therefore are unlikely to be a reliable measure of 25(OH)D status in subjects with evidence of a significant systemic inflammatory response.
