Therefore, the aim of the present work was to study the effect of mechanical breakdown on the β-carotene bioaccessibility of carrot samples, having different textural/structural characteristics (as a result of thermal processing). In the first part of this study, the all-E-β-carotene bioaccessibility of carrot particles of different sizes (ranging from cell fragments up to large cell clusters), generated from raw as well as from gently and intensely cooked carrot samples, was determined. In the second part of the study, the effect of human mastication on the particle size reduction of raw as well as of gently and intensely cooked carrot samples was investigated in order to allow identification and validation of a technique that could mimic mastication during in vitro procedures.
