CONCLUSION: In patients with stage I to III CRC, postoperative plasma vitamin D is associated with clinically important differences in survival outcome, higher levels being associated with better outcome. We observed interactions between 25-OHD level and VDR genotype, suggesting a causal relationship between vitamin D and survival. The influence of vitamin D supplementation on CRC outcome will require further investigation.
