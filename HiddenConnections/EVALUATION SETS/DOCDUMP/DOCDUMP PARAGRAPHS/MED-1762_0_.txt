Abstract Background: Observational studies suggest that effects of vitamin D may be stronger for cancer mortality than for incidence. Yet, existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation have limited power to examine the relationships as their primary end points are not cancer incidence or mortality. Methods: Meta-analyses of RCTs of vitamin D supplementation and total cancer incidence and mortality were conducted.
