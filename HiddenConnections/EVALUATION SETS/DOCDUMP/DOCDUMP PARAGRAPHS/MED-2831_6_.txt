There was a linear 17% increase in risk per 1000 mg/24hr (p=0.05). Spline curves supported a linear association of sodium with cardiovascular events, continuing to descend from 3600 to 2300 and 1500 mg/24hr, although the data were sparse at the lowest levels. Controlling for creatinine levels had little effect on these results.
