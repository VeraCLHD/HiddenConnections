Abstract Postprandial lipoproteins are potentially atherogenic. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether acute consumption of red wine (RW) and dealcoholised red wine (DRW) regulates postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in 17 dyslipidaemic postmenopausal women. A mixed meal accompanied by either water, RW or DRW was consumed on three separate visits, in random order, 2 weeks apart.
