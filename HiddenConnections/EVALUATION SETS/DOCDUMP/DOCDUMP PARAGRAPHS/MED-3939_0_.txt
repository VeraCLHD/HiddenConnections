Abstract OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the association between fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) and mental health disorders. METHOD: This study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), a repeated cross-sectional study of Canadians with five waves between 2000 until 2009 (n=296,121 aged 12 years or older). FVI was assessed based on frequency of consumption.
