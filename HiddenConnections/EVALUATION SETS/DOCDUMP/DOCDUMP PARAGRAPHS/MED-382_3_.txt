These data suggest that aglycones inhibit facilitated glucose uptake whereas glycosides inhibit the active transport of glucose. The non-glycosylated dietary polyphenols appear to exert their effects via steric hindrance, and (-)-epigallochatechingallate, (-)-epichatechingallate and (-)-epigallochatechin are effective against both transporters.
