Pooling of results of included studies was not possible. In two individual studies no statistically significant difference in infection rate between the intervention and control diet was identified; another study showed no significant difference in the number of chemotherapy cycles with an infection between the treatment groups. None of the studies mentioned infection-related mortality, but in one study no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups was observed.
