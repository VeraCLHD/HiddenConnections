The increased risk of harms was observed within and across clinically defined specific groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lack of RCTs reporting long-term (>6 months) harms data. In short-term trials, men with ED randomized to sildenafil had an increased risk of all-cause any AEs, headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances.
