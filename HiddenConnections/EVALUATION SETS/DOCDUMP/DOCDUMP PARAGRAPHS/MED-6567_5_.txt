Of the 1122 women with complete dietary data, 160 had died by the end of follow-up. Among postmenopausal women only, those in the highest versus lowest quartile of lignan intakes had a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all cause mortality (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26–0.91) and a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer mortality (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11–0.76). Higher intakes of dried beans (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36–1.03), but not fruits, vegetables, or grains, were also weakly associated with overall mortality.
