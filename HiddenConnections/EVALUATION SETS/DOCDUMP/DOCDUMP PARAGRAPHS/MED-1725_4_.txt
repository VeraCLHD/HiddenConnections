RESULTS: The number of media reports inversely correlated with the actual number of deaths for the health risks evaluated. SARS and bioterrorism killed less than a dozen people in 2003, but together generated over 100 000 media reports, far more than those covering smoking and physical inactivity, which killed nearly a million Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging health hazards are over-reported in mass media by comparison to common threats to public health.
