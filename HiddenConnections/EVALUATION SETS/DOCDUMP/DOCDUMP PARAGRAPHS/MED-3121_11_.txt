Blood pressure showed transient reductions of 1-2 mm Hg at 6 months in the calcium group, resulting in a significant between-group difference only for systolic pressure (P = 0.048). At 30 months, the change from baseline in systolic pressure was 0.0 +/- 0.9 mm Hg in the calcium group and 2.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg in the placebo group (P = 0.14). For diastolic pressures, the changes were -0.2 +/- 0.4 and 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively (P = 0.13).
