Oxidative stress, trace metals and clinical parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: At the start of the study (t0) total peroxides and copper serum content of AD patients were higher (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, respectively) and antioxidants were lower (P < 0.05) than in healthy controls. Copper and peroxides were correlated in the AD population (Pearson's r = 0.61, P < 0.001).
