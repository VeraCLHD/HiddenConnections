The number of media reports for each health risk was correlated with the corresponding death rate as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: The number of media reports inversely correlated with the actual number of deaths for the health risks evaluated. SARS and bioterrorism killed less than a dozen people in 2003, but together generated over 100 000 media reports, far more than those covering smoking and physical inactivity, which killed nearly a million Americans.
