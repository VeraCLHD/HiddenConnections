Abstract The present study investigated the effects of a diet and exercise intervention on known breast cancer (BCa) risk factors, including estrogen, obesity, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), in overweight/obese, postmenopausal women. In addition, using the subjects' pre- and postintervention serum in vitro, serum-stimulated growth and apoptosis of three estrogen receptor-positive BCa cell lines were studied. The women where placed on a low-fat (10-15% kcal), high-fiber (30-40 g per 1,000 kcal/day) diet and attended daily exercise classes for 2 wk.
