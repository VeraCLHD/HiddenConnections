Risk factors that may initiate the autoimmune process include early exposure to cow's milk proteins, nitrosamines or early foetal events such as blood group incompatibility or foetal viral infections. In conclusion, population-based epidemiological studies have helped to confirm proposed aetiological models that have arisen from experimental research. These epidemiological studies have also introduced important new findings that may reveal the complex aetiology of the disease and advance understanding closer to the ultimate goal of primary prevention.
