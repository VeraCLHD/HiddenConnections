Mood disorders are a significant cause of morbidity and the etiology of depression is still not clearly understood. Many studies have shown links between inflammatory cytokines and mood disorders, including elevated level of cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), Interleukins (IL-1,IL-6) and others. Raised levels of cytokines have been shown to increase depressive behaviour in animal models, while many anti-depressants reverse this behaviour alongside reducing the Central Nervous System (CNS) inflammatory response and reduction in the amounts of inflammatory cytokines.
