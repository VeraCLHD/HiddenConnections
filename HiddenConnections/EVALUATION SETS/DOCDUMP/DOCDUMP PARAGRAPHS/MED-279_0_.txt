Abstract Background “Cardiovascular health” is a new construct defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of its 2020 Impact Goals definition. The applicability of this construct to community-based populations and the distributions of its components by race and sex have not been reported. Methods and Results The AHA construct of “cardiovascular health” and the AHA “ideal health behaviors index” and “ideal health factors index” were evaluated among 1933 participants (mean age 59 years; 44% blacks; 66% female) in the community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation study.
