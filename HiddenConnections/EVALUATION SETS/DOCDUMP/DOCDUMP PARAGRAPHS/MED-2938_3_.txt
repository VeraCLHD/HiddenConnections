Previous high serum cholesterol level (mean level > or = 6.5 mmol/l) was a significant predictor of the prevalence of AD (odds ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 8.5) after controlling for age and the presence of apoE epsilon 4 allele. In men who subsequently developed AD the cholesterol level decreased before the clinical manifestations of AD. We conclude that high serum total cholesterol may be an independent risk factor for AD and some of the effect of the apoE epsilon 4 allele on risk of AD might be mediated through high serum cholesterol.
