The summary RR per 10 g/day of dietary fiber was 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.98, I(2) = 0%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.82). In stratified analyses, the inverse association was only observed among studies with a large range (≥13 g/day) or high level of intake (≥25 g/day). CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis of prospective studies, there was an inverse association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk.
