Abstract Curcumin interacts with a large number of extra- and intracellular targets in a biphasic dose-dependent manner. It controls inflammation, oxidative stress, cell survival, cell secretion, homeostasis, and proliferation. Its mechanisms of action are generally directed toward cells that exhibit disordered physiology or blatant mutation-based abnormal states.
