Abstract Serum antioxidant vitamins A (retinol) and E (alpha-tocopherol), beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium, and cholesterol and related proteins for 170 children with newly diagnosed malignancy were measured at diagnosis and 6 months after initiation of treatment, and compared with those of 632 cancer-free controls. Incident cancer cases and controls were 1-16 years old and recruited between 1986 and 1989. At diagnosis, age- and sex-adjusted serum concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, zinc, and alpha-tocopherol were significantly inversely associated with cancer.
