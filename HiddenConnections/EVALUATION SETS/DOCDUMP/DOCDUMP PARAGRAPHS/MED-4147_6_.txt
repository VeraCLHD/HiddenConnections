MD regimens resulted in a significantly more pronounced increase in flow mediated dilatation [WMD: 1.86%, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.48, p = 0.02; I(2) = 43%], and adiponectin [WMD: 1.69 μg/ml, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.11, p = 0.02; I(2) = 78%], while high-sensitive C reactive protein [WMD: -0.98 mg/l, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.49, p < 0.0001; I(2) = 91%], interleukin-6 [WMD: -0.42 pg/ml, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.11, p = 0.008; I(2) = 81%], and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [WMD: -23.73 ng/ml, 95% CI -41.24 to -6.22 p = 0.008; I(2) = 34%] turned out to be significantly more decreased. CONCLUSION: The results of the present meta-analysis provide evidence that an MD decreases inflammation and improves endothelial function. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
