METHODS: Potential studies of irritable bowel syndrome treatments were identified through a search of MEDLINE (1950 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to April 2011), the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and the bibliography of recent meta-analyses. Clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome were eligible for inclusion only if a description of adverse events and the number of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events were reported. The relative risk of experiencing an adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment was used to determine the number needed to harm.
