In the CNS, the cysticerci have two basic forms, isolated cysts (Cysticercus cellulosae=CC) and racemose cysts (Cysticercus racemosus=CR), and may be meningeal, parenchymal, or ventricular or have a mixed location. The clinical manifestations are based on two fundamental syndromes that may occur in isolation or be associated: epilepsy and intracranial hypertension. They may be asymptomatic, symptomatic or fatal; have an acute, sub-acute or chronic picture; or may be in remission or exacerbated.
