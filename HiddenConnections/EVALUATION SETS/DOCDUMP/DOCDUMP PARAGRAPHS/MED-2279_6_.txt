The differences between the L. plantarum levels at time zero and during all the different ingestion periods were statistically significant (P = 0.001). However, at 15 and 45 days after discontinuing supplementation, the number of lactobacilli was reduced to the baseline level (those at time zero). A longer period with L. plantarum in the diet did not result in increased levels of this bacterium in the stool, based on postconsumption evaluations (P = 0.001).
