Crohn's disease patients showed highly increased alpha-Gal-specific IgA titers compared with control subjects (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Apart from IgE, alpha-Gal-specific ABs of all isotypes remained constant over longer time periods in healthy subjects. Thus, significant titer changes actually represent increased antigen exposure and a specific anti-alpha-Gal response.
