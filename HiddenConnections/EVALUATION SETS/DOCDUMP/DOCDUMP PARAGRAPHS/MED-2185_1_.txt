METHODS: We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health. CONCLUSIONS: The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies. However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
