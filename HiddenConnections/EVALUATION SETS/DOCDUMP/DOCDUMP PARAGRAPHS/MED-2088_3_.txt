Sodium, plasma nitrate/nitrite, endothelin-1 (ET-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), vasopressin (AVP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations before and every 30 min after the soup for 2 h. Blood pressure (BP) and AI were also measured at these time points. There were significant increases in serum sodium, osmolality and chloride in response to the high sodium meal. However plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations were not different between meals (meal p = 0.812; time p = 0.45; meal Ã— time interaction p = 0.50).
