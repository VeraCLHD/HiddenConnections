METHODS: The experimental group consisted of 13 women who consumed 500 mL/d of orange juice and did 1h aerobic training 3 times a week for 3 months. The control group consisted of another 13 women who did the same aerobic training program but did not consume orange juice. RESULTS: At the end of the experiment, the control group lost an average of 15% of fat mass (P<0.05) and 2.5% of weight (P<0.05), whereas the experimental group lost 11% of fat mass and 1.2% of weight (P<0.05).
