If oxidative damage to proteins is involved in aging, long-lived animals (which age slowly) should show lower levels of markers of this kind of damage than short-lived ones. However, this possibility has not been investigated yet. In this study, steady-state levels of markers of different kinds of protein damage--oxidation (glutamic and aminoadipic semialdehydes), mixed glyco- and lipoxidation (carboxymethyl- and carboxyethyllysine), lipoxidation (malondialdehydelysine) and amino acid composition--were measured in the heart of eight mammalian species ranging in maximum life span (MLSP) from 3.5 to 46 years.
