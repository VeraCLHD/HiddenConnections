Under our living conditions, approximately 90% of all vitamin D needed by the human body has to be formed in the skin through the action of UV-B-radiation and it has been shown that strict sun protection causes vitamin D-deficiency. This dilemma represents a serious problem, for an association of vitamin D-deficiency and multiple independent diseases including various types of cancer, bone diseases, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension has now been reported in a large number of laboratory and epidemiologic investigations. Although further work is necessary to define an adequate vitamin D-status and adequate guidelines for UV-exposure, it is at present mandatory that guidelines for UV-exposure (e.g. in skin cancer prevention campaigns) consider these facts and give recommendations how to prevent vitamin D-deficiency.
