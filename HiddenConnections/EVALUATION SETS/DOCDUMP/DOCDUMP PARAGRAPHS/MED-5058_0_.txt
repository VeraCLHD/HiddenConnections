Abstract BACKGROUND: Similar to the general population in Taiwan, the health of aborigines has steadily improved over the last 30 years, but the gap remains wide, especially in males, despite an infusion of substantial medical resources. The objectives of this study are to quantify the contribution of major causes of death to the gap in life expectancy and to propose initiatives to bridge the health gap between aborigines and the general population. METHODS: This study included residents (slightly over 200000) from 30 'aboriginal townships' in Taiwan.
