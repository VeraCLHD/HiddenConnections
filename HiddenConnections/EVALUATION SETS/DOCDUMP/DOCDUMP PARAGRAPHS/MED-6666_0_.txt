Abstract In this study, the effects of a diet rich in insoluble fiber (DRIF) on motor disability and the peripheral pharmacokinetics of orally administered L-dopa in Parkinsonian patients with marked constipation are analyzed. We found a useful effect of a DRIF on plasma L-dopa concentration and motor function. The greatest effect on the plasma L-dopa levels was found early (at 30 and 60 min) after oral administration.
