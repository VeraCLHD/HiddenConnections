In recent studies, we have found that Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues are abundant on red cells and nucleated cells of nonprimate mammals, prosimians, and New World monkeys, but their expression is diminished in Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. In the present work, we have analyzed the expression of these residues on secreted mammalian glycoproteins. For this purpose, we have developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) which enables the quantification of Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues on the secreted glycoproteins.
