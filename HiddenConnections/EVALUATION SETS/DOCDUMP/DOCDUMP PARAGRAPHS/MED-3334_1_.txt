A direct demonstration that consumption of fruit decreases oxidative DNA damage in human cells would support this hypothesis. Kiwifruit was taken as an example of a food with putative antioxidant properties, and its effectiveness at decreasing oxidative DNA damage was assessed in ex vivo as well as in vitro tests. The comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) was used to measure DNA damage in lymphocytes collected during a human supplementation trial with a single 0.5-liter drink of kiwifruit juice (with water as a control).
