Cetuximab treatment alone (0.25-1 mg/mouse/injection, q3d, i.p.) effectively delayed the growth of GEO and L2987 tumors by a minimum of 10 days corresponding to log cell kill values of >or=1.0. Borderline activity was seen in the A549 and WiDr xenografts. However, cetuximab failed to show any significant antitumor activity in the HT29, HCT116, LOVO, Colo205, LX-1, HCC70, and N87 models.
