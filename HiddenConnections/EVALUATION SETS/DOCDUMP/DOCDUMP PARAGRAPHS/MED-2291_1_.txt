This process is characterized by the activation of opportunistic pathogens, representatives of which grow in large number within the system, settle in various niches, and demonstrate expansion, intruding into microbiocenoses of open biotopes of humans who, until contamination, have been clean of these microorganisms. Clones (similar to hospital strains) arising out of these populations exhibit the ability to spread "epidemically" within isolated teams. c2005 Elsevier Ltd.
