On the other hand, infusion of 0.75, 1.5 and 3 g of uncooked garlic each caused significant increase in DNA-p/min of 5.47 +/- 1.63 (P less than 0.01), 10.42 +/- 3.46 (P less than 0.01) and 29.26 +/- 4.55 (P less than 0.001) respectively. Infusion of 3 g of cooked garlic also showed significant increase in DNA-p/min of 21.43 +/- 4.62 (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the effect of cooked and uncooked (3 g) garlic.
