In total, 778 lung cancer cases and 3,430 controls, including 1,503 cancer controls and 1,927 healthy controls, were recruited. The effects of cigarette, bidi smoking, chewing and alcohol drinking on the risk of lung cancer were estimated from unconditional multivariate logistic regression. We also applied the generalized additive model (GAM) with locally-weighted running-line smoothers (loess) to find the most plausible curve for the dose-response relationship.
