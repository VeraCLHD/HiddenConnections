Abstract Hibiscus sabdariffa L. is used as a refreshing beverage and as a traditional medicine. The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro effect of phenolic compounds present in aqueous, ethyl acetate, and chloroform extracts of H. sabdariffa against mutagenicity of 1-nitropyrene (1-NP), and also the antiproliferative effect of these extracts. Inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA fragmentation were tested on transformed human HeLa cells.
