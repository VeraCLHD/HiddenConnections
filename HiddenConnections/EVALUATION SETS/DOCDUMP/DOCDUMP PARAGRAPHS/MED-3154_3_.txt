Here, we identify a bacterial metabolite, n-butyrate, that exerts immunomodulatory effects on intestinal macrophages and renders them hyporesponsive to commensals that reside in the colon. Our studies elucidate a possible mechanism that contributes to immune homeostasis in the intestines. Abstract Given the trillions of microbes that inhabit the mammalian intestines, the host immune system must constantly maintain a balance between tolerance to commensals and immunity against pathogens to avoid unnecessary immune responses against otherwise harmless bacteria.
