The ApoE genotype and SP/NFT areal densities were determined in a large population of non-demented CAD, HyperT and non-heart disease (non-HD) control subjects, and compared to findings in a similar number of AD patients. ApoE immunoreactivity was determined in many individuals. Cholesterol content in cortex was determined by HPLC in a small, loosely age-matched group of Apo-E4 genotype-matched AD, CAD and non-HD subjects.
