Abstract Data from the Third National Cancer Survey and data collected under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiologic and End Results (SEER) Program were used to perform a descriptive epidemiologic study of leukemia in Iowa. Data were also collected on livestock population patterns in the state, and a survey was performed to locate cases of lymphosarcoma within the cattle population. Ecologic relationships between human leukemia, livestock populations and bovine lymphosarcoma were investigated.
