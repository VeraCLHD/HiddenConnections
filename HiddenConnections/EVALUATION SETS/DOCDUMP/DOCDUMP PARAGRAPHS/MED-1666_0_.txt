Abstract BACKGROUND: Aspirin is valuable for preventing vascular events, but information about ulcer frequency is necessary to inform risk-benefit decisions in individual patients. AIM: To determine ulcer prevalence and incidence in a population representative of those given aspirin therapy and evaluate risk predictors. METHODS: Patients taking aspirin 75-325 mg daily were recruited from four countries.
