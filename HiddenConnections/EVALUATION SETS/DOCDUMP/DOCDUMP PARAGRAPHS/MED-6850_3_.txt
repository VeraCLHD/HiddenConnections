In addition, several proapoptotic molecules have been found to be necessary for the death of self-reactive thymocytes. On the antigen-presenting cell side, the expression of peripheral self-antigens, regulated at least in part by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein, is crucial for complete elimination of autoreactive thymocytes. The importance of thymic peripheral antigen expression and clonal deletion to self-tolerance is demonstrated in the autoimmune diseases autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy and type-1 diabetes mellitus.
