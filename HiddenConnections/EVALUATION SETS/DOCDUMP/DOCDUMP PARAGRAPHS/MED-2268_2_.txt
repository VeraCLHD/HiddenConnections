METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception until 30 June 2014. Studies that reported odds ratios or hazard ratios comparing the risk of CKD in patients consuming significant amounts of either sugar-sweetened or artificially sweetened soda versus those who did not consume soda were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects, generic inverse variance method.
