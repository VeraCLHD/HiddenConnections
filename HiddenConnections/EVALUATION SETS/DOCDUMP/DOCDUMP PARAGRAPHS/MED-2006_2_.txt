These findings indicate that BPA was able to accelerate terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. LY294002, a chemical inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), blocked completely the increasing effect of BPA on TG accumulation and expression of LPL and aP2 mRNAs. Western blot analysis revealed that BPA increased the level of phosphorylated Akt kinase.
