We compared clinical characteristics and various lifestyle factors in these three groups. RESULTS: The lifestyle factors significantly associated with NERD compared with findings in the control group were intake of egg (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.50), sleep shortage (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.54-3.88), and strong psychological stress (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.18-2.62). In male subjects, current smoking (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.13-3.74; OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.09-3.20) was a significant risk factor for both NERD and EE.
