Total urinary NO(x) significantly increased following the consumption of 100 g (P < 0路01), 250 g (P <0路001) and 500 g BJ (P <0路001) and after red beetroot-enriched bread ingestion (P <0路05), but did not reach significance for white beetroot-enriched bread compared with the no-beetroot condition. These studies demonstrated significant hypotensive effects of a low dose (100 g) of beetroot which was unaffected by processing or the presence of betacyanins. These data strengthen the evidence for cardioprotective BP-lowering effects of dietary nitrate-rich vegetables.
