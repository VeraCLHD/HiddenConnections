Abstract Pressures in the superficial leg veins of 24 patients with varicose veins and 6 normal controls were studied. In the controls there was no rise in pressure in the veins on increasing the intra-abdominal pressure, but in the patients with varicose veins pressure rose significantly. Squatting was no better than sitting in preventing transmission of intra-abdominal pressure to the leg veins.
