We tested the association between estimated NEAP and serum bicarbonate in patients with CKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements NEAP was estimated among 462 African American adults with hypertensive CKD using published equations: NEAP (mEq/d) = âˆ’10.2 + 54.5 (protein [g/d]/potassium [mEq/d]). Dietary protein and potassium intake were estimated from 24-hour urinary excretion of urea nitrogen and potassium, respectively.
