Abstract BACKGROUND: Orange juice-a rich source of vitamin C, folate, and flavonoids such as hesperidin-induces hypocholesterolemic responses in animals. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether orange juice beneficially altered blood lipids in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: The sample consisted of 16 healthy men and 9 healthy women with elevated plasma total and LDL-cholesterol and normal plasma triacylglycerol concentrations.
