A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the association of caffeine intake and other environmental factors with risk of ET. RESULTS: 179 subjects including 79 ET patients and 100 controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity were included in the analysis. Univariate analysis revealed that caffeine consumption in ET patients was higher than control group (median and 90th percentile range: 2300 (0, 9000) mg-years versus 1500 (0, 6090) mg-years, p=0.01).
