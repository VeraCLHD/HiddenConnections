To examine the effects of intensive lifestyle modification on symptom relief, we investigated changes in angina pectoris, coronary risk factors, quality of life, and lifestyle behaviors in patients with stable coronary artery disease enrolled in the multisite cardiac lifestyle intervention program, an ongoing health insurance-covered lifestyle intervention conducted at 22 sites in the united states. Patients with coronary artery disease (nonsmokers; 757 men, 395 women; mean age 61 years) were asked to make changes in diet (10% calories from fat, plant based), engage in moderate exercise (3 hours/week), and practice stress management (1 hour/day). At baseline, 108 patients (43% women) reported mild angina and 174 patients (37% women) reported limiting angina.
