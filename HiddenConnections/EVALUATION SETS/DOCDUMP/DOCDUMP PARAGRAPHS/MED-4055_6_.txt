For combination regimens, cetuximab (1 mg/mouse/injection, q3dx5, i.p.) and cisplatin (4.5 mg/kg/injection, q3dx5, i.v.) proved to be significantly more efficacious than individual monotherapies in the cisplatin-refractory yet cetuximab-responsive GEO tumor model (P < 0.001). However, no therapeutic enhancement was observed in the cisplatin and cetuximab weakly responsive A549 xenograft. Similarly, combinations of CPT-11 (48 mg/kg/injection, q3dx5, i.v.) with cetuximab (1 mg/mouse/injection, q3dx5, i.p.) failed to show any improvements over individual monotherapies in the cetuximab resistant/weakly responsive HT29, A549, and WiDr models.
