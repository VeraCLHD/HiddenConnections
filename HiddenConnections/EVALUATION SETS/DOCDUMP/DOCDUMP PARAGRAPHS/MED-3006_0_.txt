Abstract Numerous scientific papers have suggested health-promoting effects of resveratrol, including claims in the prevention of diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, it was proposed that the scientific community needed to express recommendations on the human use of resveratrol. Such recommendations were formulated after the first international resveratrol conference in Denmark, Resveratrol2010.
