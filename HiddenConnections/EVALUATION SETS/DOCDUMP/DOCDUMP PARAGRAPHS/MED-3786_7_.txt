SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of an LBD with a control diet with regard to infection rate, (infection-related) mortality, time to first febrile episode, need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability, and quality of life in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
