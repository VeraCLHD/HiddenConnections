Abstract BACKGROUND: Japanese cedar pollinosis, caused by the pollen of the Japanese cedar tree (Cryptomeria japonica), is the commonest seasonal allergic disease in Japan. A number of epidemiological surveys have been reported on Japanese cedar pollinosis, but it has never been assessed systematically or quantitatively. To confirm the increasing prevalence of Japanese cedar pollinosis and related factors, we conducted a meta-regression analysis on population-based surveys in Japan.
