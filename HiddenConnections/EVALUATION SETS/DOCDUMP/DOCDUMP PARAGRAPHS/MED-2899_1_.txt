Triclosan is structurally similar to thyroid hormones and reductions in serum thyroid hormone levels have been observed in animal studies following oral administration of triclosan. Therefore, an assessment of thyroid function over 4 years was undertaken in a subset of individuals in a randomised, placebo controlled clinical trial comparing the effects of 0.3% triclosan toothpaste with placebo toothpaste in subjects with coronary heart disease. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), antithyroglobulin antibody (anti-TGab) and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOab) were measured.
