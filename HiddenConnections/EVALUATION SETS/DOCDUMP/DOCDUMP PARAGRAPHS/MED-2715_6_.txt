In most of the studies, Cu concentrations were unchanged in the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain but increased in the serum. In conclusion, the existing data suggest that diets excessive in Fe or Cu, together with a high intake of SFA, should be avoided in the elderly who are not at risk of anaemia. Basic studies and, building on this, clinical investigations are needed to further elucidate in which dietary patterns and in which patient groups an Fe- and Cu-rich diet might foster the risk of developing AD.
