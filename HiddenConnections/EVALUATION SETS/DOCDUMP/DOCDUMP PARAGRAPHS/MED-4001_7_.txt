Total cholesterol (mean difference 0.23 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02, 0.43; P=0.03) and triglycerides (mean difference 0.15 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02, 0.31; P=0.017) were significantly lower on the tofu diet than the lean meat diet. However, HDL-C was also significantly lower on the tofu diet (mean difference 0.08 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02, 0.14; P=0.01) although the LDL-C:HDL-C ratio was similar. CONCLUSION: The effect on HDL-C and the small LDL-C reduction differ from some other studies, where fat was often less controlled, and the comparison was of soy as textured protein or soymilk against casein.
