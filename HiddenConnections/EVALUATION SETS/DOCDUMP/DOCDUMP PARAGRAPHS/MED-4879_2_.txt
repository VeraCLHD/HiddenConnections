Unfortunately, this plethora of information has also raised numerous questions regarding TOR function. Currently, the prevailing view is that mammalian TOR (mTOR) exists in at least two molecular complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are largely defined by the presence of either RAPTOR or RICTOR. However, additional co-factors have been identified for each complex, and their importance in mediating mTOR signals has been incompletely elucidated.
