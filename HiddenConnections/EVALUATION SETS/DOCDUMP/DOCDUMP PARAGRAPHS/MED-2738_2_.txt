RECENT FINDINGS: The effects of surgically induced weight loss on T2DM have elucidated in part the role of proximal and distal gastrointestinal bypass on insulin sensitivity. A dual mechanism for improvement in glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery has been proposed that appears to be weight loss independent. SUMMARY: Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities today that provide high rates of resolution of T2DM with improvements in insulin resistance and Î²-cell function.
