Abstract Classical galactosemia is an autosomal recessive condition in which there is near total absence of the activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. Patients with this condition have substantial motor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments despite dietary treatment. A characteristic pattern of biochemical abnormalities is observed in patients with this disorder.
