The EDI(meat&eggs) of PFOS and PFOA increased with increasing family income. The estimated daily intake of PFOS and PFOA through inhalation of dust (EDI(dust)) ranged from 0.23 to 0.31 ng/d and from 9.68 to 13.4 ng/d, respectively. The daily intakes of PFOS and PFOA from the consumption of meat, meat products, and eggs, and from dust ingestion, as calculated from our samples in this study, were compared with estimated daily intake of PFCs reported from the concentrations in drinking water, fish and seafood from China.
