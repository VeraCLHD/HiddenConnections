However, the mechanisms of this effect have not been elucidated. Certain vegetables possess a high nitrate content and we hypothesized that this might represent a source of vasoprotective nitric oxide via bioactivation. In healthy volunteers, approximately 3h following ingestion of a dietary nitrate load (beetroot juice 500ml) BP was substantially reduced (Î”max - 10.4/8 mmHg); an effect that correlated with peak increases in plasma nitrite concentration.
