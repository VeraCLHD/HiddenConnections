Abstract Investigations that have influenced the promotion of vitamin E supplementation are reviewed. The various forms of vitamin E found in foods and the composition of synthetic vitamin E in common use are described with note of a frequent error of identification made in reports of studies on vitamin E. Recent communications on the use of antioxidants to delay carcinogenesis in animals and in humans are discussed. The publicity given the reports of cancer prevention by antioxidants will probably increase self-supplementations.
