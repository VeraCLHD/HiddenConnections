The relative risk for these women was 1.74 (95% CI 1.13–2.68), whereas it was 0.97 (95% CI 0.59–1.58) for older women. The relative risk in the younger age-group was 1.47 (95% CI 0.73–2.97) during the first 10 years of follow-up, and 1.93 (95% CI 1.11–3.37) for follow-up times longer than 10 years. These data suggest that premenopausal women using long-term medication for urinary tract infections show a possible elevated risk of future breast cancer.
