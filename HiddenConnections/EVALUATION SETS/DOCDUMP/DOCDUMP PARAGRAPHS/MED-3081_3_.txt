The percent change in diameter of the pyloric ring before and after the administrations was defined as the opening ratio, and the percent change in diameter between the maximally and minimally opened pyloric ring states was defined as the contraction ratio. Time until disappearance of the contraction ring(s) in the gastric antrum and side effects of the drugs were also determined. RESULTS: The opening ratio was significantly higher in the peppermint oil administration group than in the hyoscine-N-butylbromide injection group.
