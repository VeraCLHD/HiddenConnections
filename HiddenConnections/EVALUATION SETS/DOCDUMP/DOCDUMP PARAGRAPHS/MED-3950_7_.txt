RESULTS: As cholesterol crystallized, the peak volume increased rapidly by up to 45% over 3 min and sharp-tipped crystals cut through and tore membranes. The amount of cholesterol and peak level of crystal growth correlated directly (r = 0.98; p < 0.01), as did the amount of cholesterol and rate of crystal growth (r = 0.99; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that crystallization of supersaturated cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques can induce cap rupture and/or erosion.
