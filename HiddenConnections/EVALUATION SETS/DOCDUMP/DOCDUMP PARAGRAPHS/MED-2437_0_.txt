Abstract Intake of dietary sodium has been linked to hypertension and consequently increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The estimated cost of CVD to both the EU and US economies is â‚¬169B and $403B, respectively. Currently the daily sodium adult intake is approximately three times the recommended daily allowance (Ireland and UK) and therefore public health and regulatory authorities are recommending reducing dietary intake of sodium to 2.4g (6g salt) per day.
