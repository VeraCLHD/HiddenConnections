For protocol 1, fasted subjects received an Institutional Review Boardâ€“approved dose of 14C-AFB1 (30 ng, 5 nCi) by capsule with 100 mL water, followed by normal eating and drinking after 2 hours. Blood and cumulative urine samples were collected over 72 hours, and 14C- AFB1 equivalents were determined by accelerator mass spectrometry.
