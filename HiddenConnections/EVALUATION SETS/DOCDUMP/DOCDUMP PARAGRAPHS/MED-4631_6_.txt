Concentrations of these LDL and HDL particles achieved with gemfibrozil were significant, independent predictors of new CHD events. For total LDL and HDL particles, odds ratios predicting CHD benefit were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.47) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.81), respectively. Mean LDL and HDL particle sizes were not associated with CHD events.
