A 10 beats per minute increase in RHR was associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in univariate models - HR (95%CI) (1.21 (1.14-1.29) and 1.15 (1.11-1.19); multivariate models adjusted for conventional risk factors - 1.16 (1.09-1.24) and 1.10 (1.06-1.14); multivariate models including hsCRP - 1.14 (1.07-1.22) and 1.09 (1.05-1.14); fibrinogen - 1.15 (1.07-1.22) and 1.09 (1.05-1.14); and both hsCRP and fibrinogen - 1.14 (1.07-1.22) and 1.09 (1.05-1.14). CONCLUSION: RHR was associated with markers of chronic low-grade inflammation. However, RHR remained associated with both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after adjusting for markers of chronic low-grade inflammation.
