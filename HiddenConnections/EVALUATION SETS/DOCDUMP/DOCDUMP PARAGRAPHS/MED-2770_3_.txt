METHODS: We performed a systematic review by searching OVID MEDLINE between 1966 and January 2010. The search strategy included "colchicine" and "poisoning" or "overdose" or "toxicity" or "intoxication." TOXICOKINETICS: Colchicine is readily absorbed after oral administration, but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.
