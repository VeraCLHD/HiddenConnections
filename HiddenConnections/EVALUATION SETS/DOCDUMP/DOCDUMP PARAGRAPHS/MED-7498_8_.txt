Results Low concentrations of PCB-77 or TCDD increased adipocyte differentiation, glycerol–3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, and expression of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ, whereas higher concentrations inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Effects of PCB-77 were abolished by the AhR antagonist α-naphthoflavone. PCB-77 promoted the expression and release of various proinflammatory cytokines from 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
