The design was balanced for seasonal and other calendar trends. RESULTS: During the almond feeding period, average body weight increased only 0.40 (kg) (p approximately 0.09). The weight change depended on baseline BMI (p = 0.05), and only those initially in the lower BMI tertiles experienced small and mainly unimportant weight gains with the almonds.
