EDD was reduced on the high sodium diet (Low: 10.3±0.9%, High: 7.3±0.7%, p < 0.05). The HS diet significantly suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma angiotensin II, and aldosterone (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that excess salt intake in humans impairs endothelium-dependent dilation independently of changes in blood pressure.
