The severity of atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis (CW) was quantified by direct digitized measurement of arterial occlusion in postmortem specimens and compared between AD and non-demented control (NDC) groups by calculating a corresponding index of occlusion. Results Atherosclerotic occlusion of the CW arteries was more extensive in the AD group than the NDC group. Statistically significant differences were also observed between control and AD groups with regard to Braak stage, total plaque score, total NFT score, total white matter rarefaction score, brain weight, MMSE scores and apolipoprotein E allelic frequencies.
