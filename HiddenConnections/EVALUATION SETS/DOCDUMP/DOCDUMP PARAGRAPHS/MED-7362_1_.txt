Sorbic acid and potassium sorbate showed no activity in either test system. When freshly prepared sodium sorbate solutions were used, no genotoxic or cell-transforming activity was detected. However, sodium sorbate as stored solution, which previously had been heated and sonicated to facilitate solubilization, yielded a positive response in both test systems.
