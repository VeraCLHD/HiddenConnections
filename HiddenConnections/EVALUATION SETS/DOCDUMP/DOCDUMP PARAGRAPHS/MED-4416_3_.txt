The extracts were analyzed and some of the constituent PPTs were also tested. Quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside (IC₅₀ =31 μM), phloridzin (IC₅₀=146 μM), and 5-caffeoylquinic acid (IC₅₀=2570 μM) contributed 26, 52 and 12%, respectively, to the inhibitory activity of the apple extract, whereas pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (IC₅₀=802 μM) contributed 26% to the total inhibition by the strawberry extract. For the strawberry extract, the inhibition of transport was non-competitive based on kinetic analysis, whereas the inhibition of cellular uptake was a mixed-type inhibition, with changes in both V(max) and apparent K(m) .
