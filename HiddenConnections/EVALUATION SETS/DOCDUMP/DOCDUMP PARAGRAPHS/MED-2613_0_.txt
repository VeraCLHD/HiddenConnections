Abstract The physiology of bone loss in aging women and men is largely explained by the effects of gonadal sex steroid deficiency on the skeleton. In women, estrogen deficiency is the main cause of early rapid postmenopausal bone loss, whereas hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency are thought to explain age-related bone loss later in life. Surprisingly, estrogen deficiency also plays a dominant role in the physiology of bone loss in aging men.
