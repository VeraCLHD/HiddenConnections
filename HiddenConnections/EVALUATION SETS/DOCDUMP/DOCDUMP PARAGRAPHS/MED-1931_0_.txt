Abstract Conservation of muscle mass is important for fall and fracture prevention but further understanding of the causes of age-related muscle loss is required. This study found a more alkaline diet was positively associated with muscle mass in women suggesting a role for dietary acid-base load in muscle loss. INTRODUCTION: Conservation of skeletal muscle is important for preventing falls and fractures but age-related loss of muscle mass occurs even in healthy individuals.
