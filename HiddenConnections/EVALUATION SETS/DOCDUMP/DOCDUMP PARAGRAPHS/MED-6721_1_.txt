Vitamin D(2) was assayed using HPLC with [(3)H]-vitamin D(3) internal standard and sterols by GC-FID mass spectrometric (MS) confirmation. Vitamin D(2) was low (0.1-0.3 μg/100 g) in Agaricus bisporus (white button, crimini, portabella) and enoki, moderate in shiitake and oyster (0.4-0.7 μg/100 g), and high in morel, chanterelle, maitake (5.2-28.1 μg/100 g) and UV-treated portabella (3.4-20.9 μg/100 g), with significant variability among composites for some types. Ergosterol (mg/100 g) was highest in maitake and shiitake (79.2, 84.9) and lowest in morel and enoki (26.3, 35.5); the range was <10 mg/100 g among white button composites but 12-50 mg/100 g among samples of other types.
