Results Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to the cooked arm, and 75 were assigned to the raw arm. The two groups were similar with respect to age, ERM, chemotherapy received, and days at risk. Twenty-nine percent of patients in the cooked group and 35% of patients in the raw group developed a major infection (P = .60).
