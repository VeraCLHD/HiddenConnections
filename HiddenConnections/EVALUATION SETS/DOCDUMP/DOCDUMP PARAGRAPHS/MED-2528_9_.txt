By contrast, metabolites of the LMW phthalates including DMP, DEP, BBzP, DnBP and DiBP showed a cyclical pattern of rising and declining concentrations suggestive of ongoing non-food exposures. Furthermore, metabolites of most of the LMW phthalates (BBzP, DnBP and DiBP) tracked each other remarkably well, suggesting concurrent exposures. Diary entries could not help explain exposure sources for these phthalates, with one exception: rises in MEP concentrations around males' showers suggest personal care products as a major source of DEP.
