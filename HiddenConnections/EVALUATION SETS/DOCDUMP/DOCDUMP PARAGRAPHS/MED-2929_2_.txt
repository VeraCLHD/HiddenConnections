Findings from the Bogalusa Heart Study indicate that most children still exceed national recommendations for intake of total and saturated fat.

Even in childhood, obesity often occurs with other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as increased blood pressure, adverse changes in serum lipoproteins, and hyperinsulinemia.
