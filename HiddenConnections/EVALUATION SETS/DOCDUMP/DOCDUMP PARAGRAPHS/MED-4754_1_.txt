With aggressive control of glycemia and blood pressure, coupled with aggressive use of laser photocoagulation and treatment of microalbuminuria, these problems can largely be eliminated. In the future, specific interventions may emerge that will allow interdiction of the pathophysiologic processes that lead to initiation and progression of these microvascular complications. The challenge for the primary care physician and diabetologist is to attain excellent glycemic control and aggressive control of blood pressure, while assuring that every patient has appropriate dilated fundus examinations at least annually, preferably by an ophthalmologist or retinal specialist, and regular screening for microalbuminuria.
