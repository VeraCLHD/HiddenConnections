Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lowered visceral perception thresholds have been suggested as a biological marker of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The current study sought to determine the prevalence of altered rectal visceral perception in patients with IBS and the correlation of altered perception thresholds with subjective symptoms. METHODS: Anorectal manometry and rectal perception thresholds to balloon distention were determined in 100 patients with IBS and 15 control subjects.
