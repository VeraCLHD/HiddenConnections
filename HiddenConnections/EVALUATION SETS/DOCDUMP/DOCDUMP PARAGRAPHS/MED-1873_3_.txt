The action of butyrate as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase was assessed in these cell lines by examining extracted core histones for their electrophoretic mobility in Triton/acid/urea gels. The concentrations of butyrate that were effective for inducing apoptosis were similar to the concentrations that caused hyperacetylation of core histones in the VACO 5 cell line. Furthermore, an examination of other carboxylic acids for induction of apoptosis revealed a rank order that corresponded to the order of potency in causing hyperacetylation of core histones.
