These supplements most commonly contain the genera Spirulina (Arthrospira) and Aphanizomenon and their consumption represent a potential route for anatoxin-a exposure in cases where adequate quality control is not undertaken. In this work, several dietary supplements containing cyanobacteria from different commercial suppliers were evaluated for the presence of anatoxin-a by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Additionally, the presence of the previously derivatized anatoxin-a was confirmed by using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
