Our primary aim was to record the self-experienced adverse food reactions in patients with RA. A secondary aim was to relate self-experienced adverse reactions to dairy produce and wheat to the local mucosal reactivity observed after rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) and wheat gluten. METHODS: A questionnaire about self-experienced adverse reaction to food was sent to 347 RA patients.
