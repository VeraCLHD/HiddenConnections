When further assessed by multiple logistic regression, tests for trend and assessment of risk in the extreme highest and lowest quintiles of the control range, the factors consistently significant were cruciferous vegetable intake and the meat/vegetable ratio. A particularly high relative risk was also noted in association with low coffee consumption (OR = 1.59, with p less than 0.05 for trend). No consistent trends were noted for fat or fibre intakes.
