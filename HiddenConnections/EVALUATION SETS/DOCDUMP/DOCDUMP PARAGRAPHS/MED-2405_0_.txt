Abstract BACKGROUND: Japanese longevity is the highest in the world. This is partly explained by low occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, which in turn is attributed to the Japanese traditional diet (JTD). Recent research demonstrates that nitric oxide (NO), a key regulator of vascular integrity, can be generated from nitrate (NO(3)(-)), abundantly found in vegetables.
