The present studies are the first Danish reports of a novel operation to cure this disease, stapled haemorrhoidopexy (n = 40 and 258 patients). The majority of patients had prolapsed haemorrhoids, and the durability of procedure was confirmed with a follow-up of up to 5 years, meaning a normal anus. The operation time was short, post-operative pain was low, and recovery was rapid.
