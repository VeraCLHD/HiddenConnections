Here we first discuss on the different molecular pathways of cell death focusing on apoptosis in colon epithelial cells. Bile acids may induce apoptosis in colonocytes through different mechanisms. In contrast to hepatocytes, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway seems to have a low relevance regarding bile acid cytotoxicity in the colon.
