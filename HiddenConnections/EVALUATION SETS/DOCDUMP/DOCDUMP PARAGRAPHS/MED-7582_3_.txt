In Canada, so far, no HEV outbreak has been documented but HEV genotype 3 strains have been identified in sera and faecal samples of swine origin. The objective of the present study was to determine the viral load of HEV in liver, loin, bladder, hepatic lymph node, bile, tonsil, plasma and faeces samples of 43 pigs at slaughter. Feline calicivirus (FCV) was used as sample process control to validate the RNA extraction process, as a confirmation of the absence of sample inhibitors and as an amplification control.
