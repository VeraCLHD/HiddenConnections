Human studies suggest that homocysteine (Hcy) plays a role in brain damage, cognitive and memory decline. Numerous studies in recent years investigated the role of Hcy as a cause of brain damage. Hcy itself or folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause disturbed methylation and/or redox potentials, thus promoting calcium influx, amyloid and tau protein accumulation, apoptosis, and neuronal death.
