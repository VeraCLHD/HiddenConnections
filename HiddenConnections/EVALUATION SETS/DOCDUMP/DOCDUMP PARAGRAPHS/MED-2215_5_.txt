While some of the outstanding effects of vitamin D deficiency and toxicity relate to calcium homeostasis, the vast majority of the target tissues appear not to be primarily related to calcium metabolism, but rather to the activation and regulation of exo- and endocrine secretory and somatotrophic processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation. Also, several highly calcium-dependent tissues such as striated and smooth muscles are not genomic targets for vitamin D. The reviewed data on the diverse and extensive presence of target tissues forecast a high therapeutic potential for vitamin D and especially its low-calcemic analogs, far beyond that which is presently utilized.
