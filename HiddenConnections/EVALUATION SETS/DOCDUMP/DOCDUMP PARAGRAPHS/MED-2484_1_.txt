Balsamic vinegar is made from grapes and generally consumed in the Mediterranean region. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of balsamic vinegar on LDL oxidation and foam cell formation. Balsamic vinegar had stronger 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging abilities and higher polyphenol concentrations than rice vinegar.
