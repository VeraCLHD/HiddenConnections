The prevalence of ail-positive Y. enterocolitica was determined in samples using both a fluorogenic 5â€² nuclease PCR assay and a culture method. The mean prevalence was 13.10% (366 of 2,793 fecal samples tested) when both PCR- and culture-positive results were combined. Forty-one of 77 premises (53.25%) contained at least one fecal sample positive for the ail sequence.
