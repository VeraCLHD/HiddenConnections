A dose dependant inhibition of rabbit platelet aggregation was observed with garlic. Onion also showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the collagen-induced platelet aggregation but this inhibition was of a lesser magnitude compared to garlic when related to dose. The concentration required for 50% inhibition of the platelet aggregation for garlic was calculated to be approximately 6.6 mg ml(-1) plasma, whereas the concentration for onion was 90 mg ml(-1) plasma.
