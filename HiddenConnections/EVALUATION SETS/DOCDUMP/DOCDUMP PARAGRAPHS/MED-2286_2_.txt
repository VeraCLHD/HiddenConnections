By this means the faecal microflora are separated from faecal dietary-fibre residues. These two components, with water-soluble material in the stool, comprise 98.3 +/- 0.9% of faecal solids. The purity of the microbial fraction was demonstrated by Gram and plant stains and by scanning electron microscopy.
