According to the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) guidelines for the management of hypertension, instructions to reduce dietary salt intake to the level of 5 g/day based on the WHO recommendation should be provided to all patients, regardless of their requirement for drug treatment. Unfortunately, the patients' response to this measure is heterogeneous, mainly due to variable compliance with the doctor's prescription and to a lesser extent to different individual BP salt sensitivity. This article discusses the factors affecting the probability of a successful intervention focusing in particular on the doctor's commitment to evaluate the patient's dietary habits, to point out the main sources of salt in the patient's diet, to provide the patient with adequate motivation and with proper instructions to implement gradual reduction of his/her salt intake, not disregarding the need for regular follow-up.
