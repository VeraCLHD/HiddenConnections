Blood removed from each heart was tested for antibodies to T. gondii by using the modified agglutination test (MAT). Sera were first screened using 1:25, 1:50, 1: 100 and 1:200 dilutions, and hearts were selected for bioassay for T. gondii. Antibodies (MAT, 1:25 or higher) to T. gondii were found in 104 (27.1%) of 383 lambs.
