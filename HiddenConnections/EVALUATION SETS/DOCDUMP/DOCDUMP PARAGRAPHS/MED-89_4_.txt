Avns (AvExO, Avn-C, and the methylated form of Avn-C (CH3-Avn-C)) significantly inhibited cell proliferation of both COX-2-positive HT29, Caco-2, and LS174T, and COX-2-negative HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines, CH3-Avn-C being the most potent. However, Avns had no effect on COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in Caco-2 and HT29 colon cancer cells. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of Avns on colon cancer cell proliferation may be independent of COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production.
