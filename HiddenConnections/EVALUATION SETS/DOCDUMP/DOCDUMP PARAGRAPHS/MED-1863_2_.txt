Three controlled diets that differed in the amount of meat (40 or 600 g) and resistant starch (37 g added to 600 g meat diet) were fed in random order, and fecal ATNC, as well as fecal ammonia and parameters of bowel function, were measured after 19 days of dietary adaptation. Mean ATNC excretion during the high-meat period was 114 micrograms/day, three times that during the low-meat period of 35 micrograms/day (p = 0.02); ammonia excretion was twice that during the low-meat period: 2.9 vs. 1.4 mmol/day (p = 0.03). The fecal ATNC were dissolved in the fecal water, and 45% had a molecular weight < 3,000.
