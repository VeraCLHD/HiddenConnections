Moderately increased mucosal reactivity to CM and gluten was found in 22% and 33%, respectively, of the patients. No relationship was found between self-experienced adverse reactions to CM or gluten and mucosal reactivity to these proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived FI is reported frequently by RA patients, with a prevalence similar to that reported previously in the general population.
