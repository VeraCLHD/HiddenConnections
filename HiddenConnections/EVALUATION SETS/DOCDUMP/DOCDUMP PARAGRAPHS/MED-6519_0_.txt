Abstract This article describes the development of a series of choline- and betaine-controlled diets that were served to research subjects as part of an ongoing study of diet requirements in humans. These diets were developed based on the analysis of choline and betaine in individual foods. The calculated diets were compared with analyses of all foods combined into a single sample for each day.
