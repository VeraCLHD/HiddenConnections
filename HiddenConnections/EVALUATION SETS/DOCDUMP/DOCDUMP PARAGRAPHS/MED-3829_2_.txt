In groups A and B, contraction of the gallbladder after egg yolk administration was not significantly different from that of normal subjects. However, in group C, gallbladder contraction was impaired (p less than 0.01-0.05), compared with that in normal subjects. After the administration of egg yolk, plasma CCK levels increased from 12.4 +/- 4.5 to 25.3 +/- 12.0 pg/ml in normal subjects.
