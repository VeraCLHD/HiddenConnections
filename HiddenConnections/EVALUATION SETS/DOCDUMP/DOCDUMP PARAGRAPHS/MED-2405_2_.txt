Recent research demonstrates that nitric oxide (NO), a key regulator of vascular integrity, can be generated from nitrate (NO(3)(-)), abundantly found in vegetables. It can reduce blood pressure (BP) via its serial reduction to nitrite (NO(2)(-)) and to bioactive NO. Interestingly, JTD is extremely rich in nitrate and the daily consumption is higher than in any other known diet.
