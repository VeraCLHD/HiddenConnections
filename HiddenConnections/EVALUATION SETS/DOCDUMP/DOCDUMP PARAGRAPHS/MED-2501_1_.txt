A direct causal association between salt intake and blood pressure levels has been clearly established. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence for additional blood pressure-independent pathways linking excess salt intake to the process of atherosclerosis. Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials showed that moderate reduction of salt intake is associated with reduction of blood pressure and, in perspective, with reduction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in hypertensive individuals.
