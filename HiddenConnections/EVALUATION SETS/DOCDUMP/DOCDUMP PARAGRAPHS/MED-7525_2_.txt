We also report what is known about the direct action of SHBG in breast cancer cells, illustrating its interaction with these cells and the subsequent initiation of a specific intracellular pathway leading to cross-talk with the estradiol-activated pathway and, finally, to the inhibition of several effects of estradiol in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, as a result of its unique property of regulating the estrogen free fraction and cross-talking with the estradiol pathways, by inhibiting estradiol-induced breast cancer cell growth and proliferation, SHBG is associated with a reduced risk of developing the neoplasm after estrogen exposure. 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
