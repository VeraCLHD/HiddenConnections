Abstract Dietary salt plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure, and the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone controls salt homeostasis and extracellular volume. Recent observations suggest that a small increase in plasma sodium concentration may contribute to the pressor response of dietary salt. Because endothelial cells are (i) sensitive to aldosterone, (ii) in physical contact with plasma sodium, and (iii) crucial regulators of vascular tone, we tested whether acute changes in plasma sodium concentration, within the physiological range, can alter the physical properties of endothelial cells.
