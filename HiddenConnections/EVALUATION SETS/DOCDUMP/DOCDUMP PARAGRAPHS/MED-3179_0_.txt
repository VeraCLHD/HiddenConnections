Abstract Soy protein was shown to exhibit several beneficial effects on renal function in nondiabetic patients with nephropathy, and to improve serum lipids. This study examined the effects of isolated soy protein consumption on urinary albumin excretion, serum lipids, plasma amino acids, and isoflavones in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Male patients (n = 14) with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy were followed in a crossover design for 7 mo.
