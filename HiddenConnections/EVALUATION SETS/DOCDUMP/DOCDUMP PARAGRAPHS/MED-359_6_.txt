RESULTS: From the subjects included in the study, 87% consumed a boiled Greek type of coffee. Moreover, 40% had a 'low', 48% a 'moderate' and 13% a 'high' daily coffee consumption. There was a linear increase in FMD according to coffee consumption ('low': 4.33 ± 2.51% vs 'moderate': 5.39 ± 3.09% vs 'high': 6.47 ± 2.72%; p = 0.032).
