RESULTS: Analysis of the seven-day diet record showed that diets were similar in energy, protein, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated and unsaturated fat, polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio, alcohol and fiber. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly lower, and in vitro LDL oxidation lag phase was significantly longer on the tofu diet compared to the meat diet. The hemostatic factors, factor VII and fibrinogen, and lipoprotein(a) were not significantly affected by the tofu diet.
