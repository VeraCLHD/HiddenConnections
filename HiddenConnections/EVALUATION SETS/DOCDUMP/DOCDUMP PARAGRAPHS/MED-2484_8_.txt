Oil red O staining showed that balsamic vinegar inhibited oxidized LDL-induced foam cell formation in THP-1 macrophages. The concentrations of intracellular triglycerides and total cholesterols were reduced in the presence of balsamic vinegar. In addition, balsamic vinegar decreased the mRNA and protein expression level of scavenger receptors in THP-1 macrophages.
