Abstract Background: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accumulates in the hippocampus and frontal lobes of the fetal brain during the last trimester of pregnancy. These areas of the brain contribute to attention and working memory and inhibitory control (WMIC). Objective: We evaluated the effect of maternal omega-3 (nâˆ’3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in pregnancy on child attention and WMIC.
