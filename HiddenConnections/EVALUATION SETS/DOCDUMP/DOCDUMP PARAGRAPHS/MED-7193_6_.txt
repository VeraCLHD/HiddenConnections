No significant association was observed between alcohol intake and breast cancer-specific survival. Women who consumed 10 g per day (corresponding to approximately 0.75 to 1 drinks) or more of alcohol had an adjusted HR (95% CI) of breast cancer-specific death of 1.36 (0.82–2.26;ptrend=0.47) compared with non-drinkers. A significant inverse association was observed between alcohol and non-breast cancer deaths.
