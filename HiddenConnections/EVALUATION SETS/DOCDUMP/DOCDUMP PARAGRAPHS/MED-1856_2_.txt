Extracts from yellow and red raspberries were equally able to inhibit Î±-amylase. Because the yellow raspberry extracts effectively lacked anthocyanins, this suggested that they were not crucial for amylase inhibition. Notably, however, higher levels of other phenolic components in yellow raspberries (particularly, ellagitannins) did not increase amylase inhibition.
