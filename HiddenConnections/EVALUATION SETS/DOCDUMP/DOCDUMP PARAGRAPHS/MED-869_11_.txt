Continuous measures of carotenoids improved survival (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51–0.89, P = .01). Women in the highest tertile of total carotenoids were more likely to survive those in the lowest (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27–0.91, P = .03). When examined in the same model, continuous measures of physical activity (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.42–0.68, P < .001) and carotenoids (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59–0.98, P = .04) predicted survival during follow-up.
