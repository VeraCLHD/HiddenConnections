Other etiologies of vitamin D induced hypercalcemia include hyperparathyroidism, granulomatous malignancies like sarcoidosis and mutations in the CYP24A1 gene. The differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia should include iatrogenic and genetic etiologies. C24-hydroxylation and C3-epimerization are two important biochemical pathways via which 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) is converted to its metabolites, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) or its C3 epimer, 3-epi-25-OH-D3 respectively.
