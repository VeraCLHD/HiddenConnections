After controlling for known risk factors and current milk consumption, each additional glass of milk per day during teenage years was associated with a significant 9% higher risk of hip fracture in men (RR=1.09, 95% CI 1.01–1.17). The association was attenuated when height was added to the model (RR=1.06, 95% CI 0.98–1.14). Teenage milk consumption was not associated with hip fractures in women (RR=1.00, 95% CI 0.95–1.05 per glass per day).
