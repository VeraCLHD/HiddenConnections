Abstract BACKGROUND: Inconsistent associations have been reported between diet and breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the association between dietary patterns and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a US-wide cohort study. DESIGN: Data were analyzed from 40 559 women who completed a self-administered 61-item Block food-frequency questionnaire in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, 1987-1998; 1868 of those women developed breast cancer.
