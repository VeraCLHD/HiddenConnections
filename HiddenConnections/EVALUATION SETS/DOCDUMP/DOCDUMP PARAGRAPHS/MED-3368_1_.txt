Eight highly trained male triathletes performed four exhaustive endurance tests (ET), each separated by at least 2 weeks. Each ET consisted of a 90-min run followed by 90 min of cycling, both at 70% VO2max. Workloads were then gradually increased on the cycle, and subjects continued to cycle until exhausted.
