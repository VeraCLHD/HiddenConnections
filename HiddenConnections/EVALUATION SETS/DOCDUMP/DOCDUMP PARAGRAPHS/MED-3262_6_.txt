24h ambulatory blood pressure was reduced by 7.7/5.2mmHg (4.1-11.2/2.7-7.7,p<0.001 for both). Home blood pressure was reduced by 8.1/3.8mmHg (3.8-12.4/0.7-6.9,p<0.001 and p<0.01) with no evidence of tachyphylaxis over the 4-week intervention period. Endothelial function improved by ~20% (p<0.001) and arterial stiffness was reduced by 0.59m/s (0.24-0.93;p<0.01) after dietary nitrate consumption with no change after placebo.
