However, the interrelationships between apoE genotype, plasma cholesterol levels and AD risk have been studied very little. We examined the possible role of serum total cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD in a population-based sample of 444 men, aged 70-89 years, who were survivors of the Finnish cohorts of the Seven Countries Study. Previous high serum cholesterol level (mean level > or = 6.5 mmol/l) was a significant predictor of the prevalence of AD (odds ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 8.5) after controlling for age and the presence of apoE epsilon 4 allele.
