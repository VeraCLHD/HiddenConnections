After incubation for 24, 48, 72, and 92 h, the cells were harvested and extracted for 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The proteins involving proliferative and apoptotic pathways were evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: MTT assay revealed cell toxicity at more than 10(-5) mol/l for DEHP and at 10(-4) mol/l for both BBP and DBP in MCF-7 cells.
