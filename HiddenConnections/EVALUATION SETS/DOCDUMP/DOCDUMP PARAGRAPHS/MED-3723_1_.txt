The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible associations of the recommended food groups of the DASH diet eating plan with BP values in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the present cross-sectional study, 225 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 61·1 (SD 10·4) years; diabetes duration 13·1 (SD 9·1) years; males 48·4 %; BMI 28·5 (SD 4·3) kg/m(2); HbA1c 7·1 (SD 1·3) %; systolic BP 136·7 (SD 20·0) mmHg; diastolic BP 78·4 (SD 11·8) mmHg) without dietary counselling during the previous 6 months had their dietary intake assessed by 3 d weighed-diet records. Patients were divided into two groups according to BP tertiles: LOW BP (first tertile) and HIGH BP (second plus third tertiles).
