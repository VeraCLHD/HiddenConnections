We aimed to prospectively determine associations of mercury exposure, as assessed by biomarker measurement, with incident diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used neutron activation analysis to measure toenail mercury, an objective biomarker of methylmercury exposure, in 9,267 adults free of diabetes at baseline in two separate U.S. prospective cohorts. Incident diabetes was identified from biennial questionnaires and confirmed by validated supplementary questionnaire using symptoms, diagnostic tests, and medical therapy.
