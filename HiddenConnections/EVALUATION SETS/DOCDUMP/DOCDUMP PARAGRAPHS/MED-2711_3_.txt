Indeed, following chelated removal of metals, incubation with iron or copper salts reestablished lesion-dependent catalytic redox reactivity. Although DAB oxidation can also detect peroxidase activity, this was inactivated by H2O2 pretreatment before use of DAB, as shown by a specific peroxidase detection method. Model studies confirmed the ability of certain copper and iron coordination complexes to catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of DAB.
