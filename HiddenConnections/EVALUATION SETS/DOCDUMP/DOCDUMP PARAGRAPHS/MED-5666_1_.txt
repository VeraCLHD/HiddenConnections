The study sample consisted of mothers on macrobiotic diets, containing little or no diary products and meat, at 2-3 months postpartum (n = 9) and 9-13 months postpartum (n = 12), and mothers on omnivorous diets at 2-3 months postpartum (n = 10). Protein and zinc concentrations in breast-milk from macrobiotic mothers decreased with stage of lactation. After adjustment for stage of lactation, milk from macrobiotic mothers contained less calcium, magnesium and saturated fatty acids C15:0-C20:0, and more polyunsaturated fatty acids.
