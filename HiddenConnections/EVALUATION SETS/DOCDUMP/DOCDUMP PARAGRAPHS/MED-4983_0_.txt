Abstract Use of antioxidant components is a new approach for improvement of insulin resistance (IR) as a main feature of type 2 diabetes and its complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of broccoli sprouts powder (BSP) containing high concentration of sulphoraphane on IR in type 2 diabetic patients. Eighty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 g/d BSP (A, n = 27), 5 g/d BSP (B, n = 29) and placebo (C, n = 25) for 4 weeks.
