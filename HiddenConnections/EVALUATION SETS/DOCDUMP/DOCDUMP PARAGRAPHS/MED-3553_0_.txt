Abstract OBJECTIVE: High intake of whole-grain products may protect against prostate cancer, but overall evidence is limited and inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the intake of whole-grain products and risk of prostate cancer in a large prospective cohort. METHODS: A total of 26,691 men aged 50-64Â years participated in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study and provided information about diet and potential prostate cancer risk factors.
