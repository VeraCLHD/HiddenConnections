Insulin decreased on the 13 g intervention but not the 26 g (P = .021) and 0 g (P = .013) periods (13 g = -2.12 ± 1.00 mU/L, 26 g = 0.67 ± 0.84 mU/L, 0 g = 1.20 ± 1.16 mU/L). HOMA-IR decreased on the 13 g period but not on the 26 g (P = .012) and 0 g (P = .008) periods (13 g = -0.71 ± 0.31, 26 g = 0.27 ± 0.24, 0 g = 0.51 ± 0.35). The α-linolenic fatty acid decrease for the 0 g period was different than the 13 g (P = .024) and 26 g (P = .000) periods (13 g = 0.20 ± 0.04, 26 g = 0.35 ± 0.07, 0 g = -0.01 ± 0.07).
