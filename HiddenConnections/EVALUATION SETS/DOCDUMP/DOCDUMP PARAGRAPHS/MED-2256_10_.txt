When focusing on a subset of men with baseline EFD ≥ 24 (N = 132), 36% (N = 47, 95% CI: 28% to 44%) returned BTB at 24 months using a PDE5i and 16% (N = 21, 95% CI: 11% to 23%) without the use of aPDE5i. For this group, there was a significant difference by age (<60 years, 23% vs. ≥60 years, 4%, P< 0.001), which remained a significant predictor (OR = 6.25, 95% CI: 1.88 to 50, P< 0.001) in multivariable analysis. Conclusions Twenty-two percent of the entire sample and 16% of the men with functional (EFD ≥ 24) baseline erections returned to BTB EF without the use of medication.
