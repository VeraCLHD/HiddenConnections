Abstract BACKGROUND: GI endoscopy without general anesthesia causes a hyperperistaltic state in the stomach, which frequently necessitates the use of antispasmodic agents, such as hyoscine-N-butylbromide, but these drugs have side effects. Peppermint oil is harmless and acts locally to inhibit GI smooth muscle contraction. METHODS: A randomized double-blind, double-dummy, controlled trial was conducted in 100 patients to compare the antispasmodic effects of hyoscine-N-butylbromide administered intramuscularly and a placebo solution administered intraluminally by means of the endoscope, and also the effects of a placebo solution administered intramuscularly with those of a peppermint oil solution administered intraluminally.
