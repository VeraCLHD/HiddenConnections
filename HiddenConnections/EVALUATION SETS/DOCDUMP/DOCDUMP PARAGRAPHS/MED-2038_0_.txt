Abstract The authors prospectively evaluated the association of soy food intake with lung cancer risk, overall and by tumor aggressiveness, and performed a meta-analysis of published data. Included in the analysis were 71,550 women recruited into the Shanghai Women's Health Study (Shanghai, China) in 1997â€“2000. Usual soy food intake was assessed at baseline and reassessed during follow-up through in-person interviews.
