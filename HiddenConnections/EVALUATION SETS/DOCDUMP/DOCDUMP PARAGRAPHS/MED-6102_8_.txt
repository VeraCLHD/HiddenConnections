Children ate similar weights of food across conditions; thus, the daily energy intake decreased by 142 kcal (12%) from the 100% to 75% ED conditions (P < 0.05). Children rated their liking of manipulated foods similarly across ED amounts. Conclusion: The incorporation of substantial amounts of purÃ©ed vegetables to reduce the ED of foods is an effective strategy to increase the daily vegetable intake and decrease the energy intake in young children.
