In a population of 100 normal subjects the 0-8 h urinary recoveries after an oral dose of 60 mg beetroot extract were 0.06-0.54% for betacyanin 1 and 0.01-0.6% for betacyanin 2. The distributions of these data were skewed but not clearly bimodal by visual inspection or by kernel density analysis. Four subjects produced visibly red urine and had betacyanin recoveries at the upper end of the population range.
