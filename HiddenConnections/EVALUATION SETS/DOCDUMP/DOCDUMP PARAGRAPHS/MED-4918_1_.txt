It is less specific and much less potent in mice and has only slight effects in rats. Differences in rates and sites of metabolism of MPTP to its active, toxic, highly polar metabolite, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine), appear to influence species specificity. In rats, type B monoamine oxidase (MAO-B), which mediates the conversion of MPTP to MPP+, may act as an enzymatic barrier at brain microvessels, whereas in primates the enzyme, present mainly in astrocytes, appears important for bioactivation of MPTP into the toxic metabolite.
