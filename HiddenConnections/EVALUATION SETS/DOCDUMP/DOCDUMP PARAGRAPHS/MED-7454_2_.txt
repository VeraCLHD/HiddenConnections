Objective: The objective was to examine cross-sectional associations of various nutrients and dietary factors as well as food groups with creatinine-adjusted first morning urinary melatonin (6-sulfatoxymelatonin; aMT6s) concentrations. Design: Participants were 998 healthy women from 2 independent cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; n = 585) and NHS II (n = 413). We computed least-squares mean hormone concentrations across categories of dietary variables, with adjustment for total energy intake, age, and other nondietary factors known to be associated with aMT6s concentrations.
