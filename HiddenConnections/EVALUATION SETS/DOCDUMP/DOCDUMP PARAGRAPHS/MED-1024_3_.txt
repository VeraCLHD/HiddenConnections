An increase in IL-8 secretion by stimulated cells occurred in the presence of IP6. The incubation of cells attached to laminin with IP6 alone (100-250 BM) did not effect cell morphology, but in the presence of 10(-7) M fMLP altered cell shape. A direct effect of IP6 on cell function was to trigger a sustained assembly of F-actin.
