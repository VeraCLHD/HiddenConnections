Regression analyses examined relationships of food consumption with log-transformed metabolite concentrations, examined as low-molecular weight, high molecular weight and di-2-ethylhexylphthalate categories, controlling for urinary creatinine, age group, body mass index category, race/ethnicity, caloric intake and gender. RESULTS: We identified a -0.04% (95% CI: -0.08, -0.01) increment in di-2-ethylhexylphthalate metabolite concentration/additional gram fruit consumption, a +0.01% increment/additional calorie dietary intake (95% CI: +0.003, +0.02), and a +0.09% (95% CI: +0.02, +0.17) increment/additional gram meat/poultry/fish consumption. Soy consumption (-0.40% increment/additional gram consumed, 95% CI: -0.66, -0.14) was inversely associated with di-2-ethylhexylphthalate, while poultry (+0.23% increment/additional gram consumed, 95% CI: +0.12, +0.35) was positively associated.
