Between days 14 and 28 p.i. (end of the experiment), antibody titres decreased in 14 ducks, remained the same in seven ducks, and continued to increase in three ducks. Bioassay in mice revealed T. gondii in the breast and leg muscles and the heart (100%, n=47), brain (91%, n=22), liver (54%, n=13) and stomach (46%, n=24). The infected ducks showed no clinical signs; however, the results of bioassay indicate that, compared with some gallinaceous birds, domestic ducks were relatively susceptible to T. gondii infection.
