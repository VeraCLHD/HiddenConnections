Antibacterial toothpaste did not alter nitrate reduction in the mouth (P > 0.9) or blunt the increase in nitric oxide status (P > 0.9). Thus, our study has demonstrated that increasing nitrate intake results in a dose-related increase in nitrate reduction in the mouth and nitric oxide status, and that use of antibacterial toothpaste does not inhibit nitrate reduction or blunt increases in circulating nitric oxide.
