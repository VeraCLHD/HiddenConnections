In this study, we attempted to engineer the isoflavone pathway in the popular fruit crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L). Tomato plants were transformed with a soybean (Glycine max L) isoflavone synthase (GmIFS2) cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated the presence of genistin (genistein 7-O-glucoside) as the major isoflavone metabolite in the transgenic plants.
