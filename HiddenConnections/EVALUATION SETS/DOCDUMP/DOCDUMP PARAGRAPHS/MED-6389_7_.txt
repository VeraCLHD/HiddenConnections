Participants were predominantly African American (85.5%) aged 25.3 ± 6.8 y (mean ± SD). Per 10-unit increase, GL was positively (adjusted OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00–1.03) and NNR was negatively (adjusted OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.88–0.99) associated with BV compared to normal vaginal flora. In prospective analyses, only GL was associated with BV progression (adjusted OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00–1.05) and persistence (adjusted OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01–1.04) after adjustment.
