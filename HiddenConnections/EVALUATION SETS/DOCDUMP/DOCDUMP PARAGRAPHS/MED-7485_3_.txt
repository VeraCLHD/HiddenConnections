Binding to CB2 was weaker with inhibition constants exceeding 50 microM for EGC and ECG. The epimers (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin exhibited negligible affinities for both CB1 and CB2. It can be concluded that central nervous cannabinoid receptors may be targeted by selected tea catechins but signaling via peripheral type receptors is less likely to play a major role in vivo.
