Spinach resulted in an eightfold increase in salivary nitrite and a sevenfold increase in salivary nitrate concentrations from pre-meal (P<0.001) to 120min post meal. Spinach compared with control resulted in higher large artery elasticity index (P<0.001), and lower pulse pressure (P<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (P<0.001). Post meal carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (P=0.07), augmentation index (P=0.63), small artery elasticity index (P=0.98) and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.13) were not significantly altered by spinach relative to control.
