Recently, many of these new functions of FADD were shown to be independent of DRs. Moreover, FADD function is dictated by protein localization and phosphorylation state. Thus, FADD is a crucial and unique controller of many essential cellular processes. The full understanding of the networks dictating the ultimate function of FADD may provide a new paradigm for other multifaceted proteins.
