The prevalence of T. gondii was determined in 383 lambs (<1 year old) from Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, USA. Hearts of 383 lambs were obtained from a slaughter house on the day of killing. Blood removed from each heart was tested for antibodies to T. gondii by using the modified agglutination test (MAT).
