DES appears to cause epigenetic effects in animals and there is some evidence that this also occurs in man. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis are complex and the effects are difficult to prove due to the background of dietary and environmental phyto- and xenooestrogens. It has been suggested that, like other endocrine disrupters, DES may have acted as an obesogen in the human population.
