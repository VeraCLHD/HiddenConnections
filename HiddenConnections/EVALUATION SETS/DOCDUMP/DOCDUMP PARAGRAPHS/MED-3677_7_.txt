We have identified ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress as one of the molecular mechanisms implicated in NEFA-induced beta-cell apoptosis. ER stress was also proposed as a mechanism linking high-fat-diet-induced obesity with insulin resistance. This cellular stress response may thus be a common molecular pathway for the two main causes of Type 2 diabetes, namely insulin resistance and beta-cell loss.
