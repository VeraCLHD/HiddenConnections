The clastogenic potency of sodium sorbate was found to be less than one hundredth of that of the potent clastogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The induction of SCE by sodium sorbate was twice the control level, whereas that by methyl methanesulphonate, a potent inducer of SCE, was 14 times the control level. The mutagenic potency of sodium sorbate was less than one-tenth that of ethyl methanesulphonate, a potent inducer of mutation, when compared at an equitoxic level.
