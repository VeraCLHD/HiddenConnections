Blood and urine samples were collected during both studies and vascular tone was measured using laser Doppler imaging. In the chronic intervention study FVPD consumption was found to significantly increase dietary carotenoids (P=0.001) and vitamin C (P=0.003). Plasma carotenoids were increased (P=0.001), but the increase in plasma vitamin C was not significant.
