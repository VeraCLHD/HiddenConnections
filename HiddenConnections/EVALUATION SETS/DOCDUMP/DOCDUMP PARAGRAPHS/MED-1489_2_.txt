Although the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in PI-IBS are currently unknown, it is believed that a transitory inflammation leads to subtle but permanent changes in the structure and function of the digestive system that induce symptoms. This review considers recent evidence surrounding the role of inflammatory mediators in the development of hypersensitivity, along with the mediators and mechanisms of abdominal pain and discomfort once the acute inflammation has cleared. Recent data suggest that anatomic changes to mast cells-nerve fibers are necessary, but not sufficient to induce symptoms.
