CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates statistically significant increased risks of CKD in patients consuming sugar-sweetened soda, but not in patients consuming artificially sweetened soda. This finding suggests that sugar-sweetened soda consumption is associated with CKD and may impact clinical management and primary prevention of CKD in high-risk patients.
