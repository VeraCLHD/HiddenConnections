In the present work, we have analyzed the expression of these residues on secreted mammalian glycoproteins. For this purpose, we have developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) which enables the quantification of Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues on the secreted glycoproteins. Purified biotinylated anti-Gal was used as the antibody in the RIA, and bovine thyroglobulin enriched for Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues served as a solid-phase antigen.
