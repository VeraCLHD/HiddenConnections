METHODS: Each patient in the treated group (n = 409) was given approximately 200 mL of the solution (a mixture of 8 mL of peppermint oil and 0.2 mL of Tween 80 per 1 L of water with 0.04% indigo carmine) by using a hand pump attached to the accessory channel of the colonoscope. Changes in patient posture were made to distribute the solution. The patients in the control group (n = 36) were given the solution without peppermint oil.
