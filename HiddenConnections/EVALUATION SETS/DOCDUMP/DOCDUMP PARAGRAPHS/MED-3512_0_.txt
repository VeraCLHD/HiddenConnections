Abstract To determine serum lipid levels and their correlates in one of the world's most isolated populations, 62 adult Yanomamo Indians from the Amazonian rain forest were examined. After measurement of body weight and height, and estimation of age, casual blood samples were obtained. Estimated age ranged from 20 to 68 years, with men averaging 37 and women 35 years.
