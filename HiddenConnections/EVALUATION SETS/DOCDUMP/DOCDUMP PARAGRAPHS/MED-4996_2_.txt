The second pathway, microsatellite instability, is characterized by an abundance of subtle DNA mutations and diploidy. Although the genes causing chromosomal instability remain unknown, microsatellite instability is caused by inactivation of a DNA mismatch repair gene (predominantly MLH1 or MSH2). Microsatellite instability is present in 15% of colorectal cancers, and is diagnosed by analysis of tumor DNA from paraffin blocks and by demonstration of loss of mismatch repair protein expression in cancers.
