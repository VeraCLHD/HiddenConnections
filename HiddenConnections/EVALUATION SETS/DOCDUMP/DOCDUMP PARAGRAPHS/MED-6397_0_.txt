DESIGN/METHODS: Ten investigators at 13 private, ambulatory, primary care sites in the United States enrolled and treated 346 outpatient adults 18-72 years of age with migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of 6 hours duration.
