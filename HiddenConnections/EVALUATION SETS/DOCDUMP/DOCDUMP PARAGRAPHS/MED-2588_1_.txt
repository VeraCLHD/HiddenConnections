The mechanisms involved are still in need of elucidation, but evidence is accruing that the fatty acid (FA) composition of human milk plays a role. The composition of body fats, from circulating erythrocyte lipids to brain phospholipids, is linked in infants to the early feeding mode and which FA predominates among circulating lipids influences visual and neurodevelopmental performance test scores. In these studies, greater differences were found between breast-fed and standard formula-fed infants, the latter showing low tissue long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA: arachidonic acid, AA, 20:4n-6; eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, 20:5n-3; docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 22:6n-3) accretion and lower visual and neurodevelopmental test scores.
