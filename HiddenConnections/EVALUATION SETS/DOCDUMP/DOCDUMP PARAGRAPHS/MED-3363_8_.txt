Only after drinking a meal most subjects (80%) wanted to consume more of the same meal, in order to alleviate hunger (63%) or quench thirst (37%). We conclude that mode of consumption plays a role in alleviating hunger and thirst. Subjects required further consumption after drinking the meal, motivated by hunger or thirst, showing that drinking a meal causes confusion that may imply a risk of overconsumption.
