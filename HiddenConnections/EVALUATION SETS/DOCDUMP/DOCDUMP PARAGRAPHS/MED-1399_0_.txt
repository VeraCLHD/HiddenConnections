Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a high-fat and low-fat diet on taste sensitivity to oleic acid (C18:1) in lean and overweight/obese (OW/OB) subjects. DESIGN: Randomized cross-over dietary intervention involving the consumption of a high-fat (>45% fat) and low-fat (<20% fat) diet, both consumed over a 4-week period. SUBJECTS: A total of 19 lean, mean age 33±13 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 23.2±2.2 kg m(-2) and 12 OW/OB, mean age 39.5±3 years, mean BMI 28±2.6 kg m(-2), subjects participated in the study, which measured taste thresholds for C18:1, fat perception and hedonic ratings for regular (RF) and lowered-fat (LF) foods before, and following consumption of a high- and low-fat diet.
