In addition, the presence of multiple and actively diversifying myostatin genes in most fish species provides a unique opportunity to study adaptive molecular evolution. It may also provide insight into myostatinâ€™s nonmuscle actions as results from these and other comparative studies gain visibility in biomedical fields.
