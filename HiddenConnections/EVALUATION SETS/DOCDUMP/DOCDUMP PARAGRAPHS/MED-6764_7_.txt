The frequency of persons with pathologic values of LDL cholesterol was significantly higher in periodontitis patients compared with that of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that high serum LDL cholesterol may be associated with periodontitis in healthy people. However, it is unclear whether periodontitis causes an increase in the levels of serum LDL or an increased LDL is a risk factor for both periodontitis and cardiovascular disease.
