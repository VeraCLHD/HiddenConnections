In response to EGF treatment, SS cells exhibited a growth spurt and induced c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogene expression, whereas butyrate-treated cells exhibited minimal growth response to EGF. This relative unresponsiveness to EGF in butyrate-treated cells corresponded to a dramatic decline in EGF receptor levels when compared to untreated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Butyrate appears to inhibit colon cancer cell growth by two mechanisms, one involving histone hyperacetylation and p21 induction and the other related to impaired EGF-responsiveness.
