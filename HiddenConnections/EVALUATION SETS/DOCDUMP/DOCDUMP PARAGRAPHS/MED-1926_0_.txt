Abstract Purpose of Review To highlight recent advances in nutrition and protein research that have the potential to improve health outcomes and status in aging adults. Recent Findings The beneficial effects of dietary protein on muscle health in older adults continue to be refined. Recent research has bolstered support for moderately increasing protein consumption beyond the current RDA by adopting a meal-based approach in lieu of a less specific daily recommendation.
