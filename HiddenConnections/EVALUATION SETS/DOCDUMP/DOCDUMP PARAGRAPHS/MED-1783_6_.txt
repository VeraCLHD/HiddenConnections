The compliance with the suggested caloric intake was better with the VPD than with the APD (97 vs. 88% of recommended intake), as was the compliance with the suggested protein intake (94 vs. 112% of recommended intake) and with the suggested phosphate intake (102 vs. 116%). The mean glomerular filtration rate, as judged by 51Cr-EDTA, was similar after 6 months on each diet and remained unchanged throughout the entire year of the study. The rate of fall of glomerular filtration, as measured by the slope of 1/serum creatinine was slowed by 73% during the 1-year study period as compared with the prestudy period.
