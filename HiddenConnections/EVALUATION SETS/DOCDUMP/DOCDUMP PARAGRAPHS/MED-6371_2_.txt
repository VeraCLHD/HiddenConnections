Urease assay was used to calculate the percentage of adhesion inhibition. In two thirds of the isolates, adhesion to the gastric cells was inhibited by 0.2 mg/mL of the nondialysable material. There was no relationship between the antiadhesion effect of the cranberry material and metronidazole resistance in isolates from either treated or untreated patients (N=35).
