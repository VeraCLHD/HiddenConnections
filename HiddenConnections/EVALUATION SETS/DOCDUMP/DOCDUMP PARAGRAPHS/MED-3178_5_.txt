The caloric intake was higher and the protein, phosphate and essential amino acid intake lower on the VPD than on the APD. The compliance with the suggested caloric intake was better with the VPD than with the APD (97 vs. 88% of recommended intake), as was the compliance with the suggested protein intake (94 vs. 112% of recommended intake) and with the suggested phosphate intake (102 vs. 116%). The mean glomerular filtration rate, as judged by 51Cr-EDTA, was similar after 6 months on each diet and remained unchanged throughout the entire year of the study.
