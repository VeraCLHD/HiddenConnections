However, for consuming 5+ cups of caffeinated coffee daily, RR was 1.61 [95% CI, 1.00, 2.59; p for trend=0.02]; tea or caffeinated cola intake were not associated with risk. Greater caffeine intake was more adversely associated with POAG among those reporting family history of glaucoma, particularly in relation to POAG with elevated IOP (p for trend =0.0009; p-interaction=0.04). Conclusion Overall caffeine intake was not associated with increased risk of POAG.
