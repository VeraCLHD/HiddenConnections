Abstract A hallmark of all forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an abnormal accumulation of the beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in specific brain regions. Both the generation and clearance of Abeta are regulated by cholesterol. Elevated cholesterol levels increase Abeta in cellular and most animals models of AD, and drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis lower Abeta in these models.
