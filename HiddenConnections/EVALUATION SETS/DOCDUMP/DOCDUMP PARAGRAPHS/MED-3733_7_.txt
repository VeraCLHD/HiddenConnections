Watermelon supplementation had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on ABI and HR. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that watermelon extract supplementation reduces ankle BP, brachial BP, and carotid wave reflection in obese middle-aged adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension and normal ABI, which may reflect improved arterial function.
