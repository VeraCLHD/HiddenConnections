In multivariate analysis, postprandial TAG were the only independent predictor of adiponectin. There was no significant association of adiponectin, NEFA and TAG with - 11 388 G/A adiponectin promoter polymorphism. Our findings favour the interpretation that postprandial adiponectin has the strongest and independent associations to postprandial TAG metabolism.
