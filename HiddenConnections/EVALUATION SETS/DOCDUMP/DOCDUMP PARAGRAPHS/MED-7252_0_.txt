Abstract Beeturia, the passage of pink or red urine after the ingestion of beetroot, is said to occur in 10-14% of the population, and is more common in iron deficiency and malabsorption. A specific HPLC assay for betacyanins, the red beetroot pigments, in biological fluids was developed to study the prevalence of this apparent polymorphism in humans, and to investigate its basis in rats. Two major peaks were observed in chromatograms of extracts of unpickled beetroot.
