Fat replacers can affect meat flavor both by adding flavors of their own, by reducing the original aroma-generating substrate (fat) and by altering release of aroma compounds. When fat is removed from meat, water is generally added to replace it. Water-binding compounds can be added to prevent the added water from cooking out or evaporating and to prevent patty shrinkage.
