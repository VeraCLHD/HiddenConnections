We found that the lipogenesis in the hamster sebaceous glands was suppressed 63 and 54% by 10(-4) M berberine (an alkaloid) and wogonin (a flavonoid), respectively. We suggest that the therapeutic effects of some Japanese Kampoh drugs experimentally used for acne vulgaris could be due to inhibition of lipogenesis by their active ingredients such as berberine and wogonin.
