Diet, as a key component of a healthy human lifestyle, plays an important role in the prevention and management of T2DM and its complications. The dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various favourable functions such as anti-inflammatory effects, improving endothelial function, controlling the blood pressure, and reducing hypertriglyceridemia and insulin insensitivity. According to some epidemiological studies, a lower prevalence of T2DM was found in populations consuming large amounts of seafood products, which are rich in n-3 PUFAs.
