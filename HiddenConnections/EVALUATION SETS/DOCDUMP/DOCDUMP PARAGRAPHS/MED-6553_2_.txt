DESIGN: Thirty patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 30 matched, nondiabetic subjects received the following 3 isoenergetic (780 kcal) meals separated by 1-wk intervals: a high-fat meal; a high-carbohydrate, low-fiber (4.5 g) meal; and a high-carbohydrate, high-fiber meal in which refined-wheat flour was replaced with whole-wheat flour (16.8 g). We analyzed serum glucose and lipid variables and serum IL-8, IL-18, and adiponectin concentrations at baseline and at 2 and 4 h after ingestion of the meals. RESULTS: Compared with nondiabetic subjects, diabetic patients had higher fasting IL-8 (P < 0.05) and IL-18 (P < 0.01) concentrations and lower adiponectin concentrations (P < 0.01) at baseline.
