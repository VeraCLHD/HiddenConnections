Abstract In a group of patients dying suddenly from ischemic heart disease, the uninfarcted heart muscle contained significantly lower concentrations of magnesium, iron, and potassium and a significantly higher concentration of calcium than the heart muscle from a group of normal controls and a group of patients dying more than three months after a coronary thrombosis. The late death group had significantly lower concentrations of manganese and copper than the normal group, and a slight decrease in magnesium concentration which was probably significant. There was no significant difference in the sodium concentration between the three groups.
