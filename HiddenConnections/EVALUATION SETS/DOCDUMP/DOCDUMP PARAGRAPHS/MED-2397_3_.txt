We also estimated population-attributable fractions of death to address the impact of potential lifestyle modifications on mortality. RESULTS: Until 2003, 8497 deaths were observed. Age-adjusted HR of all-cause mortality for the group with 6 healthy lifestyle factors was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.32-0.56) among men and 0.49 (0.39-0.60) among women, respectively, compared with the group with 0-2 healthy lifestyle factors.
