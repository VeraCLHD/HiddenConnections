The present study was designed to determine if dietary sodium intake affected endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) independently of changes in blood pressure. Fourteen healthy salt resistant adults were studied (9M, 5F; age 33 Â± 2.4 years) in a controlled feeding study. After a baseline run-in diet, participants were randomized to a 7 day high sodium (HS) (300-350 mmol/day) and 7 day low sodium (LS) (20 mmol/day) diet.
