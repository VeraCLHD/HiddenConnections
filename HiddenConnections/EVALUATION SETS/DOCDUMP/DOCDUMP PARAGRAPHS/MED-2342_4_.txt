Waist circumference, total abdominal fat levels, and subcutaneous fat levels were significantly higher in the obese group, while visceral fat levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly lower in the non-obese group, suggesting that the non-obese patients were not overtly insulin resistant. Although serum adiponectin and TNF-alpha levels were similar in both groups, leptin levels were significantly higher in the obese group.
