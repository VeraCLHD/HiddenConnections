Abstract The calcium ion (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous second messenger that is crucial for the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes. The diverse transient signals transduced by Ca2+ are mediated by intracellular Ca2+-binding proteins, also known as Ca2+ sensors. A key obstacle to studying many Ca2+-sensing proteins is the difficulty in identifying the numerous downstream target interactions that respond to Ca2+-induced conformational changes.
