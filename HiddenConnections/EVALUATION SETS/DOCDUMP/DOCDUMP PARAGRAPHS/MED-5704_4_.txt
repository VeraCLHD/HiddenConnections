The levels of p47phox in MNC homogenates increased significantly at 2 h and 3 h after glucose intake. alpha-Tocopherol levels decreased significantly at 1 h, 2 h and 3 h. We conclude that glucose intake stimulates ROS generation and p417phox of NADPH oxidase; increases oxidative load and causes a fall in alpha-tocopherol concentration.
