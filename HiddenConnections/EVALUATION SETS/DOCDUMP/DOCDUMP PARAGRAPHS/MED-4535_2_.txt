Seminal oxidative and antioxidant markers are as follows: lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyls (PC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), thiols, and ascorbic acid were determined. RESULTS: Sperm count significantly correlated positively with progressive sperm motility and normal morphology. Sperm count and normal morphology showed significant negative correlation with LPO and PC.
