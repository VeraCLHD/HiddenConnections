Purified biotinylated anti-Gal was used as the antibody in the RIA, and bovine thyroglobulin enriched for Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues served as a solid-phase antigen. In this study, it is reported for the first time that the evolutionary pattern of Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residue distribution in in vivo secreted glycoproteins is similar to that observed in membranes of cell lines and of red cells. Thyroglobulin, fibrinogen, or IgG molecules from nonprimate mammals and from New World monkeys express varying amounts of Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues ranging between 0.01 and 11 residues per molecule, whereas no such residues are present on any of these glycoproteins of human or Old World monkey origin.
