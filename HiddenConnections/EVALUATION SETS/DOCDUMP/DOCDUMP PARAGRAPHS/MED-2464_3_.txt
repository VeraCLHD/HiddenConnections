METHODS: One hundred thirty-two IGT subjects were randomized to placebo (n=66) or acarbose (n=66) 100 mg 3 times daily; the study duration was at least 3 years, mean follow-up time 3.9 (SD 0.6) years. Carotid IMT was determined at study entry and the end of the trial. The intent-to-treat analysis included 56 subjects in the acarbose and 59 in the control group who had a baseline and endpoint measurement.
