Commercial poultry products carry a relatively high prevalence of C. jejuni strains that have been associated with neuropathic sequelae. The relative proportions of LOS classes in poultry isolates were similar to those reported in isolates from human enteritis cases, and in some instances also similar to isolates from patients diagnosed with neuropathic disease. In terms of cstII polymorphisms, there were also similarities between isolates from poultry and those from patients with GBS and MFS.
