Abstract Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been described as having significantly low serum potassium concentrations than that in healthy subjects. We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral potassium supplement dissolved in grape juice in female hypokalemic patients with active RA. Thirty-two hypokalemic patients with active RA were investigated in a parallel, randomized design.
