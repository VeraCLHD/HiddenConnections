The sensory and nutritional quality of 18 samples of long grain white rice (11 regular, 7 parboiled) packaged in cans stored up to 30 years at ambient temperature in residential locations was evaluated. Hedonic scores for overall liking ranged from 5.6 to 6.6 (9-point scale) and all samples regardless of age scored above 5, "neither like nor dislike". All but one 30-year parboiled sample were considered acceptable for everyday use by greater than 50% of panelists, and for emergency use by over 88% of panelists.
