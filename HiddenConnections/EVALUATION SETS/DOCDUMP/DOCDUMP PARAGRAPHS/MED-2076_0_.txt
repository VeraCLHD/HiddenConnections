Abstract We have compared the oestrogenic potency of the synthetic oestrogen Zeranol, used as a growth promoter in meat production, and five related compounds, with the potency of 17beta-oestradiol, diethylstilboestrol (DES), genistein, and Bisphenol-A. The potency was assayed by analysing differences in expression levels of endogenous oestrogen-regulated genes in human MCF7 cells, treated with different concentrations of the compounds. Zeranol, 17beta-oestradiol and DES were about equally potent, genistein was four to six orders of magnitude less potent than 17beta-oestradiol but an order of magnitude more potent than Bisphenol-A.
