Measurements with sieving and laser diffraction methods indicated that particles were much larger in vegetables than in nuts. Particle size distributions were similar among nuts and among vegetables. Surprisingly, no inter-individual variability was observed in the particle distributions for the 6 foods, although several sequence variables differed markedly.
