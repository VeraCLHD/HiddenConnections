Methods In a cross-over design, we randomized 96 women who produced ≥10 μL NAF to a high- or low-soy diet for 6-months. During the high-soy diet, participants consumed 2 soy servings of soy milk, tofu, or soy nuts (approximately 50 mg of isoflavones/day); during the low-soy diet, they maintained their usual diet. Six NAF samples were obtained using a FirstCyte© Aspirator.
