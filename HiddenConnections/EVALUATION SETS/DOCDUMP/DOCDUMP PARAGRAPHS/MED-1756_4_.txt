Using a cross-sectional design, we examined serum concentrations of [25(OH)D] in 790 breast cancer survivors from western Washington, New Mexico and Los Angeles County. Cancer treatment data were obtained from SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) registries and medical records. Fasting blood, anthropometry and lifestyle-habits were collected post-diagnosis and treatment.
