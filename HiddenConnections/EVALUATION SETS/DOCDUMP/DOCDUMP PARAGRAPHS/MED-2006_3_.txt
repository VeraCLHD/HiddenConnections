LY294002, a chemical inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), blocked completely the increasing effect of BPA on TG accumulation and expression of LPL and aP2 mRNAs. Western blot analysis revealed that BPA increased the level of phosphorylated Akt kinase. Based on these findings, we concluded that BPA acted through the PI 3-kinase and Akt kinase pathway, resulting in increased TG accumulation and expression of adipocyte genes.
