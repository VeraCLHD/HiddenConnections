During 9 +/- 3 months of follow-up, the treatment was actually performed in 95/97 episodes of impending syncope (98%) and was successful in 94/95 (99%). No patients suffered injury or other adverse morbidity related to the relapses. CONCLUSIONS: Isometric arm contraction is able to abort impending vasovagal syncope by increasing systemic BP.
