METHODS Twelve juvenile Yorkshire pigs underwent aortic cannulation and infusion of a low-viscosity acrylic resin at physiological pressures. After curing of the resin and digestion of all organic tissue, the anatomy of the blood supply to the spinal cord was studied grossly and using light and electron microscopy. RESULTS All vascular structures ≥ 8μm in diameter were preserved.
