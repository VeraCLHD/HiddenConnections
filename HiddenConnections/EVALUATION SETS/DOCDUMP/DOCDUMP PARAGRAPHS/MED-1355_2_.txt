The internal diameter of the left coronary artery and the coronary blood flow were measured by intracoronary Doppler-wire measurement and quantitative angiography before and immediately after a single LDL apheresis in a population of 15 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed by intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (1, 10, and 50 microg/min), and endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed by intracoronary bolus infusion of isosorbide dinitrate (2.5 mg) or papaverine (10 mg). A single 3-hour LDL apheresis reduced serum LDL cholesterol by an average of 86.6 +/- 1.7%.
