Measurement of inÂ vitro digestible P (DP) content of foods may reflect absorbability of P. The objective of this study was to measure both total phosphorus (TP) and DP contents of selected foods and to compare the amounts of TP and DP and the proportion of DP to TP among different foods. METHODS: TP and DP content of 21 foods and drinks of plant origin were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.
