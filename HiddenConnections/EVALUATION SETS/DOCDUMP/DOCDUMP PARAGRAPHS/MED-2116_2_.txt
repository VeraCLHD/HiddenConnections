OBJECTIVE: To assess diet and its relation to urinary phthalates in a nationally representative sample of US children and adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of 24-h dietary recall and urinary phthalate metabolites from 2743 6-19 year olds participating in the 2003-8 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Regression analyses examined relationships of food consumption with log-transformed metabolite concentrations, examined as low-molecular weight, high molecular weight and di-2-ethylhexylphthalate categories, controlling for urinary creatinine, age group, body mass index category, race/ethnicity, caloric intake and gender.
