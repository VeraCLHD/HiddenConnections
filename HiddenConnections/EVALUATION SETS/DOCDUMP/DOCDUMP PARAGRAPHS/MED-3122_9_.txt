We found statistically significant heterogeneity of results across trials (P < or = .02), which persisted when we looked at the nondietary trials alone, but not when we restricted our analysis to dietary trials. Although there was a trend toward larger effects with dietary interventions, none of the possible mediators of blood pressure reduction explained differences in treatment effect. We conclude that calcium supplementation leads to a small reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
