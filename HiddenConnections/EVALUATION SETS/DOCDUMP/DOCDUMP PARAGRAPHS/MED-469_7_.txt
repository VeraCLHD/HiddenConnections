Poor semen quality is related not only to testicular cancer but also to zygote development, in which cancer-like disruption of the genetic apparatus is observed, with serious implications for offspring health. This needs to be seen in the context that human reproduction is prone to a higher degree of impairment than that of other mammalian species, in relation to spermatogenesis, couple fertility, early pregnancy loss and embryonic aneuploidy; female- and male-mediated pathways are both implicated. It is unclear whether such human specificity originated on an evolutionary/genetic or a historico-social timescale, which is important in relation to pathogenesis.
