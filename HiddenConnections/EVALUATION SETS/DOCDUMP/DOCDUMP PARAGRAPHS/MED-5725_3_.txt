Design: In this prospective study of 3898 men and women from the Cardiovascular Health Study (1989â€“2007), we assessed egg consumption by using a picture-sorted food questionnaire and ascertained incident T2D annually by using information on hypoglycemic agents and plasma glucose. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted relative risks. Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.3 y, 313 new cases of T2D occurred.
