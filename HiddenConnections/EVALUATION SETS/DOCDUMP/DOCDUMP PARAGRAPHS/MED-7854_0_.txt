Abstract Bioactivity-guided fractionation of black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed coats was used to determine the chemical identity of bioactive constituents, which showed potent antiproliferative and antioxidative activities. Twenty-four compounds including 12 triterpenoids, 7 flavonoids, and 5 other phytochemicals were isolated using gradient solvent fractionation, silica gel and ODS columns, and semipreparative and preparative HPLC. Their chemical structures were identified using MS, NMR, and X-ray diffraction analysis.
