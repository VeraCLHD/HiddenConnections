Dietary exposure estimates indicate that the weekly consumption of up to two 100g portions of lamb, ox, calf or pig liver or one portion of deer liver would not breach the tolerable daily intake (TDI) level even when the rest of the diet was included. However, the consumption of more than one portion of deer liver per week may lead to the TDI being exceeded. Crown Copyright Â© 2010.
