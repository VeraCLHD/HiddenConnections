Abstract To explore the feasibility and sensitivity of a new technology for measuring gastric emptying time (GET) in appetite research, and also to compare appetite after subjects consumed macronutrient- and fiber-matched liquid and solid meals. Fourteen women (BMI of 21.2 Â± 0.3) participated in this randomized, crossover study. On two separate days, fasted subjects consumed liquid (fruit juices and skim milk) and solid (oatmeal, blueberries, and apples) breakfasts.
