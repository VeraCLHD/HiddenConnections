RESULTS: Among the 24,492 outpatients that had at least 2 glomerular filtration rate estimates > or =3 months apart, 6895 had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, indicating a 28.2% period prevalence of chronic kidney disease. The rate of clinical diagnosis among those with chronic kidney disease was 26.5% (95% confidence interval, 17.9 to 35.1), suggesting that 74% of patients with chronic kidney disease are undiagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is substantially higher in health-seeking individuals than in the general population.
