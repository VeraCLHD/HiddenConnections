Abstract BACKGROUND/AIMS: Non-volatile acid is produced by metabolism of organic sulfur in dietary protein, and promotes kidney damage. We investigated the role of dietary acid load, in terms of net endogenous acid production (NEAP), in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. METHODS: 217 CKD patients on low-protein diet with a normal serum bicarbonate level were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study in Japan.
