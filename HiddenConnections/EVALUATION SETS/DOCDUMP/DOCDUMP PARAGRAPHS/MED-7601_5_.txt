In contrast, no consistent associations were found between the reported intake of non-cola soft drinks and the serum lipids. We found no significant differences related to the reported presence or absence of sugar in the soft drinks. In multiple linear regression analyses, the colas vs. serum lipid associations prevailed (p < 0.001) after including 13 possible confounders: sex; age group; time since last meal; physical activity; intake of alcohol, coffee, cheese, fruit and (or) berries, and fatty fish; smoking; length of education; use of cholesterol-lowering drugs; and intake of non-colas.
