For the 7 contaminants reported for U. S. women by Rogan et al. and Savage, we compared the concentrations in the vegetarian women. For every contaminant except polychlorinated biphenyls, in which there were no strong differences between groups, there was no overlap in the range of scores; the highest vegetarian value was lower than the lowest value obtained in the U. S. sample. For beta-benzene hexachloride, dieldrin, and p,p'chlonophenothane, the 1 vegetarian subject who had more than trace amounts was the only subject who was nursing her 1st baby and had observed the vegetarian diet for less than a hear.
