TF is highly cytotoxic to BxPC3 and Panc-1 cell lines with IC50 values of 1.0 and 1.22 microg/ml, respectively with superior cytotoxicity than curcumin. Gemcitabine IC50 value for both of these cell line is 0.03 microg/ml; however, 30-48% of the pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to gemcitabine even at concentrations >100 microg/ml. In comparison, TF induced cell death in 96% of the cells at 50 microg/ml.
