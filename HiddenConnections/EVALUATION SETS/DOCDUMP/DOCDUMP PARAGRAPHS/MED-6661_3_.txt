Despite elevated plasma levodopa levels, all patients with elevated LNAA levels experienced parkinsonian symptoms. When the amino acid level dropped while plasma levodopa levels were elevated, patients experienced relief of these symptoms. On a low-protein diet, LNAA levels remained low and all patients were consistently dyskinetic throughout the day, even though the mean plasma levodopa levels were somewhat lower than when the patients consumed a high-protein diet.
