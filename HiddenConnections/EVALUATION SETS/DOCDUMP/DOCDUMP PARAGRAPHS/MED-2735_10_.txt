There was a significant correlation between degree of weight loss and reported fasting glucose levels (Rs -0.38, P = 0.006). Reversal rates according to diabetes duration were: short (< 4 years) = 73%, medium (4-8 years) = 56% and long (> 8 years) = 43%. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that intentional weight loss achieved at home by health-motivated individuals can reverse Type 2 diabetes.
