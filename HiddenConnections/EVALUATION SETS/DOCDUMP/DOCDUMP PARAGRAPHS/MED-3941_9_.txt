LIMITATIONS: This is a cross-sectional study, and not for making a clinical diagnosis of depressive episodes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a tomato-rich diet is independently related to lower prevalence of depressive symptoms. These results suggest that a tomato-rich diet may have a beneficial effect on the prevention of depressive symptoms.
