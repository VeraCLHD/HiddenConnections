Blood lymphocytes from 102 healthy males (18-61 yr) were analyzed for KLRG1, CD57, CD28, CD45RA, CD45RO surface expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells by 4-color flow cytometry. Advancing age (yr) was positively associated with the proportion (%) of senescent (KLRG1+/CD57+; KLRG1+/CD28-) CD4+ (B=1.00; 1.02) and CD8+ (B=0.429; 1.02) T-cells and inversely associated with na√Øve (KLRG1-/CD28+) CD4+ (B=-1.000) and CD8+ (B=-0.993) T-cells. VO(2max) was inversely associated with senescent CD4+ (B=-0.97) and CD8+ (B=-0.240).
