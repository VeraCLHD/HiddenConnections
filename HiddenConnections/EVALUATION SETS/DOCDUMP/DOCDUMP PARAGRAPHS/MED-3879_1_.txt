Studies were carried out on six normal male subjects to determine the short-term effect of increasing the dietary consumption of animal protein on the urinary risk factors for stone-formation, namely, volume, pH, calcium oxalate, uric acid and glycosaminoglycans. 2. An increase of 34 g/day of animal protein in the diet significantly increased urinary calcium (23%) and oxalate (24%).
