Because advanced glycation end products (AGEs) promote MS and neurotoxicity, we conducted studies of C57BL6 mice fed isocaloric diets containing defined AGEs [methyl-glyoxal derivatives (MG)] to determine whether food AGEs promote AD and MS. MG+-fed, but not MG−-fed, mice developed brain SIRT1 deficiency, amyloid-β deposits, cognitive and motor deficits, and MS. These findings were validated in older healthy humans with high baseline circulating MG levels by a time-dependent decline in cognition and insulin sensitivity. The data suggest that food-derived AGEs, an environmental factor, contribute to both AD and MS by causing chronic SIRT1 suppression. Importantly, reduction of food-derived AGEs is feasible and may provide an effective treatment strategy for both these epidemics.
