Abstract In order to identify whether bisphenol A (BPA) acts as an adipogenic agent, following the hormonal induction of differentiation into adipocytes, 3T3-L1 cells were treated for six days with BPA alone. Treatment with BPA increased the triacylglycerol (TG) content of the cultures, increased the percentage of Oil Red O-staining cells in the cultures, and increased the levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein (aP2) mRNAs. These findings indicate that BPA was able to accelerate terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes.
