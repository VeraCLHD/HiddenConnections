Among colorectal cancer patients, pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing highest with lowest categories were 0.71 (0.55-0.91) and 0.65 (0.49-0.86) for overall and disease-specific mortality, respectively. For breast cancer patients, the corresponding pooled estimates were 0.62 (0.49-0.78) and 0.58 (0.38-0.84), respectively. No significant evidence of heterogeneity between studies was observed.
