There were eleven interventional trials that tried to either supplement or deplete Fe and Cu, but none of them provided clear evidence of a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in patients with AD.

Case-control and autopsy studies showed elevated Fe levels in the brains of AD patients, whereas the evidence was less consistent for Cu.
