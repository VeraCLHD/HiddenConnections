Fourteen subjects recorded their food intake three times for a period of 2 d, each time collecting all the faeces passed during the next 24 h. Total antioxidant activity (TAA; mmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8 tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox)/kg) of faecal suspensions was measured using the 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS(. +)) decolorisation assay. The average TAA value of faeces was 26.6 (sd 10.2) mmol Trolox/kg wet faeces (range 7.5-50.5).
