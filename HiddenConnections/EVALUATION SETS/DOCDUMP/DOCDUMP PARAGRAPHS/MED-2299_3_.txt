Thirty-two Chinese adults residing in Shanghai participated in this quantitative and qualitative study using questionnaires and focus-group discussions. Most participants (30 of 32) consumed white rice daily and only a few (n=8) had tried brown rice previously. Before tasting, most participants considered brown rice inferior to white rice in terms of taste and quality.
