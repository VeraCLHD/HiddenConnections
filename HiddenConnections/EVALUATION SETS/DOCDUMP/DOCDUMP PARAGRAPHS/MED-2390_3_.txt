Using two different exposure measures—either presence vs. absence or quartiles of triclosan—we assessed the association between triclosan and BMI. We also screened all NHANES serum and urine biomarkers to identify correlated factors that might confound observed associations. Results Compared with undetectable triclosan, a detectable level was associated with a 0.9-point increase in BMI (p<0.001).
