Low satisfaction with the explanation of the purpose of the treatment and a poor perceived control of own health was associated with a more negative view on treatment benefit. CONCLUSION: The rationale applied by physicians prescribing statins does not seem to relate to the patients' expectations, whereas factors relating to the patient-physician relationship, the social situation and the perceived control of health seem to affect patient belief. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The association between patients' poor satisfaction of treatment explanation and a low belief in treatment benefits emphasizes the importance of the patient-physician communication.
