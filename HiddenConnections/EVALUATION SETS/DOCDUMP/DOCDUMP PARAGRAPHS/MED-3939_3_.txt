The primary outcome was a major depressive episode over the previous 12 months. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, household income, education, physical activity, chronic illness and smoking. RESULTS: In the first wave, greater FVI was significantly associated with lower odds of depression (OR: 0.85 95% CI:0.78-0.92).
