(1) The percent of left ventricle outside 2.5 SD of normal values on the dipyridamole-to-rest ratio image of normalized counts was 22 +/- 20% after the initial control period, 13 +/- 14% after the treatment period, and 26 +/- 22% after the final control period with a significant decrease (improvement) occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .02) and an increase (worsening) occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .009). (2) The percent of left ventricle with a ratio of < or = 0.66 in the dipyridamole-to-rest ratio image of normalized counts was 11 +/- 13% after the initial control period, 5.8 +/- 10% after the treatment period, and 14 +/- 19% after the final control period with a significant decrease (improvement) occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .04) and an increase (worsening) occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .02). (3) The myocardial quadrant on the polar display with the lowest average activity expressed as a percent of maximal activity was 0.81 +/- 0.18 after the initial control period, 0.87 +/- 0.014 after the treatment period, and 0.77 +/- 0.23 after the final control period with significant improvement occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .05) and worsening occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .05).
