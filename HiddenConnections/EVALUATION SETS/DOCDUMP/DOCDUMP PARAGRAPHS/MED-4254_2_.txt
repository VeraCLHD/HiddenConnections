METHOD AND RESULTS: Using a high-resolution ultrasound, WT of posterior brachial artery wall, the diameter of brachial artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia (FMD %), as well as after sublingual administration of nitroglycerine (nitroglycerine mediated dilatation (NMD) %) was measured in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers. Wall thickness (WT) of the posterior brachial artery wall and the wall index (WI) were greater in smokers than non-smokers. The baseline brachial artery diameter was comparable in smokers and non-smokers.
