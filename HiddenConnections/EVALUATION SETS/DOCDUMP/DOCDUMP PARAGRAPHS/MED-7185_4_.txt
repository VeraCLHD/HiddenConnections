For most samples, the main contribution to WHO-TEQ arose from PCDD/Fs rather than PCBs. Just under half of the lamb liver samples showed PCDD/F concentrations that exceeded the EU maximum limit of 6 ng kg(-1) fat weight (although deer liver which is not subject to the regulation, generally showed higher levels). Dietary exposure estimates indicate that the weekly consumption of up to two 100g portions of lamb, ox, calf or pig liver or one portion of deer liver would not breach the tolerable daily intake (TDI) level even when the rest of the diet was included.
