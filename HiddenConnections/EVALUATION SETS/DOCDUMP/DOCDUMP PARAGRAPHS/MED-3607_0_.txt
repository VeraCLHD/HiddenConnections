Abstract BACKGROUND: Plasma homocysteine levels have been directly associated with cardiac disease risk. Current research raises concerns as to whether comprehensive lifestyle approaches including a plant-based diet may interact with other known modulators of homocysteine levels. METHODS: We report our observations of homocysteine levels in 40 self-selected subjects who participated in a vegan diet-based lifestyle program.
