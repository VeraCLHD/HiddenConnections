The tropism of BLV has been assumed to be limited to B lymphocytes, because no other cell type has been found to harbor the virus in vivo. Since retrovirus-like particles had been identified in milk, and infection can be transmitted by milk, we decided to investigate whether BLV was in mammary epithelial cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pure cultures of mammary epithelial cells were established from cells shed into the milk of 28 cows.
