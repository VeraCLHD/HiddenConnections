The aim of the present study was to report a snapshot of data on fat in chickens now sold to the public. DESIGN: Samples were obtained randomly between 2004 and 2008 from UK supermarkets, farm shops and a football club. The amount of chicken fat was estimated by emulsification and chloroform/methanol extraction.
