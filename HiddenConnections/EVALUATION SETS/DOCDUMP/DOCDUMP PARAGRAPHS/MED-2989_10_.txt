When two salads with the same number of calories were compared, meal intake was decreased when the large portion of the lower-energy-dense salad was consumed. CONCLUSIONS: Eating a low-energy-dense first course enhances satiety and reduces meal energy intake. Consuming a large portion of a low-energy-dense food at the start of a meal may be an effective strategy for weight management.
