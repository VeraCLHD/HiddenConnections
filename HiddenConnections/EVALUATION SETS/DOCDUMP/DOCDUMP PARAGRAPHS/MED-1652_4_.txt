Bismuth subsalicylate has shown modest efficacy in treating traveler's diarrhea and acute and chronic diarrhea in children, and it is effective prophylactically for traveler's diarrhea. An epidemic of neurological toxicity was reported in France in the 1970's with prolonged bismuth treatment, usually bismuth subgallate and subnitrate. Such toxicity has been rare with bismuth subsalicylate and colloidal bismuth subcitrate.
