In two studies with blueberry or grape, additional macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, protein) were included in the control and treatment meals. Blood samples collected before and after the meal were analyzed for AOC. RESULTS: Consumption of dried plums or dried plum juice did not alter either the H- or L-AOC area under the curve (AUC).
