Abstract The clinical effects of calcium supplements on adverse events reporting have not been well described. This study reviews randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence of adverse events to clarify the epidemiology of these events. The hypothesis that patient self-report of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased in individuals receiving calcium supplementation is because of an increase in non-MI events incorrectly perceived by the patient as being because of MI, is examined.
