The 13 patients whose partners later achieved pregnancies had a mean ROS-TAC score of 47.7 +/- 13.2, similar to controls but significantly higher than the 39 patients who remained infertile (35.8 +/- 15.0; P < 0.01). ROS-TAC score is a novel measure of oxidative stress and is superior to ROS or TAC alone in discriminating between fertile and infertile men. Infertile men with male factor or idiopathic diagnoses had significantly lower ROS-TAC scores than controls, and men with male factor diagnoses that eventually were able to initiate a successful pregnancy had significantly higher ROS-TAC scores than those who failed.
