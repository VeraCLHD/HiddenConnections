In multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia, betel-nut use was independently associated with CKD (P < 0.001). The adjusted odds ratio for betel-nut use was 2.572 (95 % CI 1.917, 3.451). CONCLUSIONS: Betel-nut use is associated with CKD in men.
