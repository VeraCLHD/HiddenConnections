Abstract Colon cancer, rare in the past, and in developing populations, currently accounts for 2 to 4% of all deaths in Western populations. Evidence suggests the primary cause to be changes in diet, which affect the bowel milieu int√©rieur. It is possible that in sophisticated populations, the higher concentrations of fecal bile acids and sterols, and longer transit time, favor the production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites.
