The adjusted risk of hospitalization with a reduced estimated GFR followed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS: An independent, graded association was observed between a reduced estimated GFR and the risk of death, cardiovascular events, and hospitalization in a large, community-based population. These findings highlight the clinical and public health importance of chronic renal insufficiency.
