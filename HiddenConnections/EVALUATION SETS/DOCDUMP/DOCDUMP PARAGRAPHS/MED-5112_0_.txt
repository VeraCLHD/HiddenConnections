Abstract We have previously shown that an antibody pool present in normal human serum binds cytokine receptors in vitro and may therefore interfere with assays that capture cytokines using their receptors. Here we show that this antibody pool is the same as the natural antibody termed anti-gal, that binds to the alpha-galactosyl carbohydrate epitope (alpha-gal) and which is the predominant obstacle to xenotransplantation. We report that there are high levels of IgD anti alpha-gal in most volunteers, in addition to the IgG2, IgA and IgM immunoglobulin isotypes against alpha-gal previously described.
