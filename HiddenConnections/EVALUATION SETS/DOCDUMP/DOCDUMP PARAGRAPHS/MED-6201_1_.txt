OBJECTIVE: We determined whether orange juice beneficially altered blood lipids in subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN: The sample consisted of 16 healthy men and 9 healthy women with elevated plasma total and LDL-cholesterol and normal plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Participants incorporated 1, 2, or 3 cups (250 mL each) of orange juice sequentially into their diets, each dose over a period of 4 wk.
