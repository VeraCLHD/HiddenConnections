Abstract There is unequivocal evidence that increased sodium intake is associated with increased blood pressure, and that increased blood pressure leads to increased risk of vascular diseases. Unfortunately, the published evidence directly linking sodium intake to vascular risk is inconsistent and confusing. This review, emphasising recent developments in national and international settings, considers why this is the case and how vested interests - particularly the food industry - have exploited the vacuum.
