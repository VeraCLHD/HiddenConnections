Urinary iodine, perchlorate, and thiocyanate levels were not associated with TSH (P = 0.59) or free T4 (P = 0.14), even when adjusted for multiple variables. Conclusions: U.S. vegetarians are iodine sufficient. U.S. vegans may be at risk for low iodine intake, and vegan women of child-bearing age should supplement with 150 Î¼g iodine daily.
