Abstract To correct methodologic flaws (Type II error, confounding variables, and nonblinding) in previous studies relating infant feeding to later obesity, we conducted case-control studies of 639 patients 12 to 18 years of age attending our Adolescent Clinic, and 533 similarly aged healthy children attending a Montreal high school. Each subject was classified as either obese, overweight, or nonobese based on measurements of height, weight, and triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Feeding history, family history, and demographic data were later ascertained "blindly" by telephone interview.
