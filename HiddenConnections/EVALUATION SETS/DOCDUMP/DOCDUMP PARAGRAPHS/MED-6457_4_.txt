CIs <1, =1 and >1 indicated synergism, additiveness and antagonism respectively. Cellular accumulation of platinum and platinum-DNA binding levels from Cis and its combination with the phytochemicals were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Addition of Cis 4 h before Cur and EGCG (0/4 h combination) produced the most synergistic outcomes in both the A2780 and A2780(cisR) cell lines.
