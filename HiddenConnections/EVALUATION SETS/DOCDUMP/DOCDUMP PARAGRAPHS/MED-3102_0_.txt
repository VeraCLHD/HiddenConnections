Abstract SUMMARY: Sunlight exposure by improving vitamin D status could be a simple public health strategy in reducing falls among frail elder people. In a randomised controlled trial, adherence to sunlight exposure was low (median adherence, 26%) and no effect of increased UV exposure on falls risk was observed (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.06, P = 0.73). INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine whether increased sunlight exposure was effective to improve vitamin D status and reduce falls in the elderly.
