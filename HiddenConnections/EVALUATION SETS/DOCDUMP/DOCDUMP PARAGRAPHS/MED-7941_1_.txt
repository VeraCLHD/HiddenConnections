Turkey poults often have a high mortality rate and this may be due to poor initial feeding behavior and inadequate development of the intestinal tract. We conducted an experiment to determine the effect of dietary putrescine supplementation on growth performance and the role of dietary putrescine in prevention and recovery from a coccidial challenge. A total of 160 1-d-old turkey poults were fed a corn and soybean meal-based starter diet supplemented with 0.0 (control), 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g/100 g purified putrescine (8 birds/pen, 5 pens/diet).
