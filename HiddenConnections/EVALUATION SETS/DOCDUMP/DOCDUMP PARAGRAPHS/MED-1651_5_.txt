The administration of 1200 GalU of alpha-galactosidase induced a significant reduction of both breath hydrogen excretion and severity of flatulence. A reduction in severity was apparent for all considered symptoms, but both 300 and 1200 GalU induced a significant reduction in the total symptom score. Alpha-galactosidase reduced gas production following a meal rich in fermentable carbohydrates and may be helpful in patients with gas-related symptoms.
