In 11 diabetic patients with chronic sensorimotor neuropathy the mean endoneurial oxygen tension was 39.7 (SD 10.2) mm Hg. In all but one patient compared with none of four non-neuropathic subjects the mean nerve oxygen tensions were below dorsal foot vein values. This unphysiological state may have a role in the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy.
