General linear models were used to test whether the mean composite change score differed for participants who reported starting, stopping, continuing, or not taking each of the 100 most frequently-used medications in the NACC sample. Results The average time between assessments was 1.2 years (SD=0.42). Nine medications showed a difference (p<0.05) across the four participant groups in mean psychometric change scores from the first to the second assessment.
