We now report spectroscopic and chemical studies that show the two original compounds to be lignans, which have a 2,3-dibenzylbutane skeleton as their basic structure. Unlike all previously known natural lignans, invariably of plant origin, the two mammalian compounds carry phenolic hydroxy groups only in the meta position of the aromatic rings.
