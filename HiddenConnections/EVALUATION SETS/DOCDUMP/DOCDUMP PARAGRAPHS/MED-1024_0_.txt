Abstract Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) has anti-cancer properties, but recently other extracellular functions have been observed for IP6, including enhancing superoxide production and phagocytosis by neutrophils in the presence of microbial stimuli. This study investigated other inflammatory functions of IP6 on adherent neutrophils. The effect of IP6 on the release of IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 by neutrophils attached to either plastic or laminin for up to 6 hours in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was investigated.
