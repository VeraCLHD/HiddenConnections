Exogenous addition of antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) inhibited the anti-proliferative ability of TPL in both MCF 7 and T47 D. Annexin-V and propidium iodide double staining of cells treated with TPL for 2h revealed that TPL induced significant apoptosis in both the cell lines in a dose dependant manner but magnitude of apoptosis was significantly higher in MCF 7 than in T 47-D cells. TPL was also found to induce dose and time dependent increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species in both the cell lines. Present results have demonstrated that MCF 7 and T 47 D cells exhibited differential sensitivity to TPL, which seems to be dependant on their p53 status.
