One hundred sixty workers in turning and milling shops had direct exposure to sodium nitrite through skin, mouth, and airway because of lack of occupational protective knowledge (study group), whereas 255 workers from other workshops without direct contact with sodium nitrite served as control group. The incidence, diagnosis, and treatment of esophageal carcinoma as well as other malignant tumors in these two groups were followed until the end of 2007. The sodium nitrite exposure time in the study group ranged from 16 to 23 years, with an average of 22.1 years.
