Respective values for apparent absorption and true absorption of zinc were 13 and 32% of zinc intake in rats fed phytate, and 19 and 46% of zinc intake in rats fed the basal diet. When whole grains or mature seeds constitute a major portion of the diet, the phytate: zinc molar ratio may approach that (60:1) used in our study. Whether or not phytic acid occurring naturally in foods affects zinc metabolism to the same extent as sodium phytate can not be determined from our study.
