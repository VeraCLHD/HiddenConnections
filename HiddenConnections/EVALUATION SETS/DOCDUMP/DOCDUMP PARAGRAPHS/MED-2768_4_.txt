METHODS: The analysis included two randomized controlled trials (soy protein trial and whole soy trial) among total 450 postmenopausal women with either prehypertension or prediabetes. We conducted a pooled analysis by combining participants from both the soy flour and soy protein groups (combined soy foods group), participants from both the isoflavone and daidzein groups (combined isoflavone group) and participants from both milk placebo groups. Fasting venous samples were obtained at baseline and the end of the trial for serum UA analysis.
