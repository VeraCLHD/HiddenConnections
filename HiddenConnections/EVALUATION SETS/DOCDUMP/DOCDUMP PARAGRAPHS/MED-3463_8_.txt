In normal individuals, the IOPs measured at 0.5 h, 1 h and 1.5 h post-intervention were not affected by ingestion of caffeine. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for each measurement point were -0.740 (-2.454, 0.974), 0.522 (-0.568, 1.613) and 0.580 (-1.524, 2.684). However, in patients with glaucoma or OHT, IOP increased at each measurement point, with the WMD and 95%CI being 0.347 (0.078, 0.616), 2.395 (1.741,3.049) and 1.998 (1.522,2.474) respectively.
