There was a lower decrease in UA levels among women in the combined soy foods group compared with women in the other two groups (p = 0.028 and 0.026). The net decrease and % decrease in UA were 14.5 Î¼mol/L (95 % CI 1.93-25.6, p = 0.023) or 4.9 % (95 % CI 1.3-8.5 %, p = 0.023) between the combined soy foods group and placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese postmenopausal women with either prehypertension or prediabetes, soy intake did not increase urate levels.
