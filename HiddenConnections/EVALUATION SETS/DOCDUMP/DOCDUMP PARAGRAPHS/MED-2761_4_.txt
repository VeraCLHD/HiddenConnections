Gout can lead to inflammation and damage to cartilage, bone, bursa, tendons, heart, or kidneys. Patients with gout will have many years of asymptomatic hyperuricemia followed by episodes of acute gouty inflammation and asymptomatic periods. Some people with gout will progress to chronic gout with tophi deposits, pain, deformity, and bone and cartilage destruction.
