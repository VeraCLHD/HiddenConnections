Subjects with one or more occluded/narrowed arteries were 8.5 times more likely to have suffered from chronic (that is, three months or longer) low back pain at some time during their life than were those without such findings (odds ratio adjusted for age and sex 8.5; 95% confidence intervals 2.9, 24; p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS—The study shows that the lumbar and middle sacral arteries frequently become obliterated by atheromatous lesions during adult life, and that obliteration of these arteries is more common in subjects with a history of chronic back pain than in those without.
