To describe novel bariatric procedures, their effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and to explain the proposed mechanisms for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) resolution. RECENT FINDINGS: The effects of surgically induced weight loss on T2DM have elucidated in part the role of proximal and distal gastrointestinal bypass on insulin sensitivity. A dual mechanism for improvement in glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery has been proposed that appears to be weight loss independent.
