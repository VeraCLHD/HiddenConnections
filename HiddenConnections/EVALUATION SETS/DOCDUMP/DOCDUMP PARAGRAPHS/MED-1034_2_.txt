A history of the usual dietary intake one year prior to interview was taken using a quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Daily intakes of nutrients and selected food items were computed and stratified by tertiles of the control range, to assess risk in low-, medium- and high-intake categories. Effects were adjusted in analysis for age, sex, Chinese dialect group and occupation.
