DEHP and 4-n-NP increased the frequency of proliferating MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest concentration that significantly increased the proliferation of MCF-7 cells was 10 microM for DEHP and 1 microM for 4-n-NP. The results showed that the assay is accurate and quick to perform.
