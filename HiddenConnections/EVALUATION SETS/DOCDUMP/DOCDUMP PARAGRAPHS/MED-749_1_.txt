This prospective trial was aimed at assessing the mechanisms underlying coffee-related protective effects. METHODS: Forty patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized into two groups: the first consumed 4 cups of coffee/day for 30 days, while the second remained coffee "abstinent". At day 30, the groups were switched over for a second month.
