Results The fully adjusted model showed an annual decline of 0.26 MMSE points per unit increase in baseline sMG (p=0.03). Significance was unchanged as additional risk factors were added to the model. The interactions of sMG with diabetes, sex, age, kidney function, and APOE4 genotype were not significant.
