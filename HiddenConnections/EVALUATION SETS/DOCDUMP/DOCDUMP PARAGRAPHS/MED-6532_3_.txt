48,835 postmenopausal women, aged 50–79 years, without prior breast cancer, were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to the DM intervention group or to the comparison group. The intervention was designed to reduce total dietary fat intake to 20% of total energy intake, and to increase fruit and vegetable intake to ≥5 servings/day and intake of grain products to ≥6 servings/day, but resulted in smaller, albeit significant changes in practice.
