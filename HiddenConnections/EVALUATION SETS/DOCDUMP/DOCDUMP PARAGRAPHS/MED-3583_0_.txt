Abstract The endothelium is a highly metabolically active organ that is involved in many physiological processes, including the control of vasomotor tone, barrier function, leukocyte adhesion and trafficking, inflammation, and hemostasis. Endothelial cell phenotypes are differentially regulated in space and time. Endothelial cell heterogeneity has important implications for developing strategies in basic research, diagnostics and therapeutics.
