Isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane (SFN), are proposed to provide cytoprotection against oxidative stress. We therefore tested the ability of SFN to perform this role in lens cells and establish its ability to delay the onset of cataract. METHODS: The human lens epithelial cell line FHL124 and whole porcine lens culture systems were used.
