Few studies have examined the effect of weight loss on serum 25(OH)D concentration. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the effect of weight loss on serum 25(OH)D concentration. Data were collected from 383 overweight or obese women who participated in a 2-year clinical trial of a weight-loss program, in which 51% (N = 195) lost at least 5% of baseline weight by 24 months, 18% (N = 67) lost 5â€“10%, and 33% (N = 128) lost >10%.
