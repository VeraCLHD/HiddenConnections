Next, RRD (phasic distentions of 60-s duration separated by 30-s intervals) was given with a tracking method until the subjects had complained of pain six times. Finally, ramp distention was induced again, and the same parameters were measured. The normal value was defined by calculating the 95% confidence intervals of controls.
