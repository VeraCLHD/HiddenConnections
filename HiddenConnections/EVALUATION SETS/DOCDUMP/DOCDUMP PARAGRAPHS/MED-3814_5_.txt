A densitometry technique was used to quantify regional flow and lumen volume in vivo after inducing hyperemia. Additionally, 3 swine hearts were casted and imaged post-mortem using cone-beam CT to obtain the lumen volume and the arterial length of corresponding coronary arteries. Using densitometry, the results showed that the stem hyperemic flow (Q) and the associated crown lumen volume (V) were related by Q = 159.08 V3/4 (r = 0.98, SEE = 10.59 ml/min).
