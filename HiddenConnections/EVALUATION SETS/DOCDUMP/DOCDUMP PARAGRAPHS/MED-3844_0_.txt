Abstract The effects exerted by three mixtures of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) were evaluated on human fetal corpora cavernosa cells, as a model for male external genitalia development. The three mixtures feature congeners grouped according to potentially shared modes of action: one dioxin-like (DL) (Mix2) and two non dioxin-like (NDL) mixtures featuring congeners defined as estrogenic (Mix1) and highly persistent-cytochrome P-450 inducers (Mix3). Congeners concentrations used were derived from human internal exposure data.
