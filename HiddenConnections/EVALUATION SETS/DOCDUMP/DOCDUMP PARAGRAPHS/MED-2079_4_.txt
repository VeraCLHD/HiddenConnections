We found that sera harvested from the heifers following one month of zeranol implantation were more mitogenically potent in stimulating the proliferation of MCF-7 cells when compared to sera harvested from the same heifers before zeranol implantation and the control heifers. Further investigation found that dextran-coated charcoal suppressed the stimulating effect of the sera on MCF-7 cell growth. The mechanisms involved in the MCF-7 cell proliferation stimulated by zeranol-containing sera may include up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p53 and p21 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the cells.
