Nut consumers had a lower percentage of two risk factors for MetS: hypertension (31.5% ± 1.0% vs 34.2% ± 0.8%, p < 0.05) and low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (29.6% ± 1.0% vs 34.8% ± 0.8%, p < 0.01). Tree nut consumers had a lower prevalence of four risk factors for MetS: abdominal obesity (43.6% ± 1.6% vs 49.5% ± 0.8%, p < 0.05), hypertension (31.4% ± 1.2% vs 33.9% ± 0.8%, p < 0.05), low HDL-C (27.9% ± 1.7% vs 34.5% ± 0.8%, p < 0.01), high fasting glucose (11.4% ± 1.4% vs 15.0% ± 0.7%, p < 0.05), and a lower prevalence of MetS (21.2% ± 2.1% vs 26.6% ± 0.7%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nut/tree nut consumption was associated with a decreased prevalence of selected risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and MetS.
