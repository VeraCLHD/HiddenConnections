The reduction in mean arterial pressure with the combination (19+/-2 mm Hg) was significantly greater than that with individual agents amlodipine (10+/-2 mm Hg; P<0.005), atenolol (10+/-2 mm Hg; P<0.005), bendroflumethiazide (6+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.005), and captopril (11+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.01). In addition, the percentage reduction in systolic (18+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.005) and diastolic (17+/-2 mm Hg; P=0.06) blood pressure was greater with the combination. More patients achieved a blood pressure of <140/90 mm Hg with the combination (60%) than any individual drug (15% to 45%; P<0.05).
