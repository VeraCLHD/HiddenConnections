Abstract Endogenous advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) include chemically crosslinking species (glycotoxins) that contribute to the vascular and renal complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). Renal excretion of the catabolic products of endogenous AGEs is impaired in patients with diabetic or nondiabetic kidney disease (KD). The aim of this study was to examine the oral absorption and renal clearance kinetics of food AGEs in DM with KD and whether circulating diet-derived AGEs contain active glycotoxins.
