Abstract CONTEXT: While medical journals strive to ensure accuracy and the acknowledgment of limitations in articles, press releases may not reflect these efforts. METHODS: Telephone interviews conducted in January 2001 with press officers at 9 prominent medical journals and analysis of press releases (n = 127) about research articles for the 6 issues of each journal preceding the interviews. RESULTS: Seven of the 9 journals routinely issue releases; in each case, the editor with the press office selects articles based on perceived newsworthiness and releases are written by press officers trained in communications.
