METHODS: Human liver L02 and HepG2 cells were treated with sodium palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, for up to 48 h with or without lithium chloride, a glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor, or GSK-3β shRNA transfection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect morphological changes, flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis, a colorimetric assay was used to detect caspase-3 activity, and western blot analysis was used to detect protein expression. RESULTS: The data showed that sodium palmitate was able to induce lipoapoptosis in L02 and HepG2 cells.
