Significant increases of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels were found in mitogen-stimulated cultures from aged donors, occurring at 24 to 72 h after stimulation. No significant differences were observed for IFN-gamma production. Proliferative capability of cells stimulated with PHA was not impaired in aged subjects.
