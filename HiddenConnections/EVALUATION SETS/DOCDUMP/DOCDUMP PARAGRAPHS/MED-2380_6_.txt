Measurements included biomarkers of plasma nitric oxide status, assessed by measuring S-nitrosothiols + other nitroso species (RXNO) and nitrite, and a biomarker of nitrate reduction in the mouth, assessed by measuring salivary nitrite. Compared to 0 mg, all doses of nitrate resulted in higher plasma RXNO and nitrite, and salivary nitrite (P < 0.05). A linear dose-response to nitrate intake was observed with plasma RXNO and nitrite, and salivary nitrite (P < 0.001).
