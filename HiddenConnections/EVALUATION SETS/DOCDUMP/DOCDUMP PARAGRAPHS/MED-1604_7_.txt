IL-8 concentrations did not change significantly after consumption of any of the 3 meals. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that circulating IL-18 and adiponectin concentrations are modulated by familiar foodstuffs in humans. Meal modulation of cytokines involved in atherogenesis may represent a safe strategy for ameliorating atherogenetic inflammatory activity in diabetic patients.
