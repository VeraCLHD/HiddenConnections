Results were similar at study end. Secondary measures at study end favoring intensive therapy (p<0.05) included development of macroalbuminuria, cataract extraction, visual acuity, a score of >2.0 on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, loss of ankle jerk and light touch. Conclusions Intensive glycemic treatment did not reduce the risk of advanced measures of microvascular outcomes, but delayed the onset of macroalbuminuria and some measures of eye complications and neuropathy.
