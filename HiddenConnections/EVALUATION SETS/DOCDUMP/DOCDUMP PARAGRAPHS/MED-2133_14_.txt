The nutritional status of PD patients did not differ significantly from those of controls though several studies have shown excess intake of animal fats or reduced consumption of coffee are risks in PD. In contrast, water intake was significantly lower in PD patients than controls (604.0+/-377.2 ml/d vs 909.5+/-531.6 ml/d; P<0.0001). Interestingly, PD patients tended not to feel thirsty and thus they had no desire to drink water throughout their life.
