CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of scientific basis for food restrictions, a wide variation in policies related to low-microbial diets, and inconsistent compliance with restricted diets. Furthermore, lack of consistent practice has not been related to incidence of infection. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Evaluation of an evidence-based project such as this can lead to change in practice and institutional policy.
