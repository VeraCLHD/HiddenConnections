Abstract Our understanding of coronary artery disease risk and the atherosclerotic process has changed greatly in recent years. For example, it is now known that angiographically apparent coronary artery plaque is not the major cause of myocardial infarction (MI). Rather, it is unstable, soft plaque that cannot be seen angiographically that is prone to rupture and result in infarction.
