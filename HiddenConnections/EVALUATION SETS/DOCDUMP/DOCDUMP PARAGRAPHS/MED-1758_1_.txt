However, other lipid-soluble vitamins decrease during the systemic inflammatory response, and this response may confound the interpretation of plasma 25(OH)D. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether plasma 25(OH)D concentrations change during evolution of the systemic inflammatory response. DESIGN: Patients (n = 33) who underwent primary knee arthroplasty had venous blood samples collected preoperatively and postoperatively (beginning 6-12 h after surgery and on each morning for 5 d) for the measurement of 25(OH) D, vitamin D-binding protein, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, C-reactive protein, and albumin. A final sample was collected at 3 mo.
