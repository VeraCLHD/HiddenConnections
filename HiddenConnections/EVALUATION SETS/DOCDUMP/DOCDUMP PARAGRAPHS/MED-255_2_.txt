Sitting for 5 h (1st vs. 5th h) resulted in an increase in calf venous pooling (17%) and a decrease in calf BF (13%), a reduction in gravitational pooling in the thigh (corresponding to increased pooling in the calf), increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressures (6 and 7.3 mmHg, respectively), and minor changes in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The results show that it is necessary to sit for 1 h before hemodynamic responses can be assessed in this position, regardless of the posture maintained previously. The main effect of prolonged sitting is pooling in the calf, which is compensated for by an increase in peripheral resistance.
