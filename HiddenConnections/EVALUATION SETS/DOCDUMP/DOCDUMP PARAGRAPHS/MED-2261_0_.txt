Abstract OBJECTIVES: A patient with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer can choose from an array of therapies. A patient's willingness to trade life for freedom from therapy-induced long-term symptoms is poorly investigated. METHODS: In October 2002, we attempted to collect information from the 591 men who had been diagnosed and registered with prostate cancer in 1999 in Stockholm County.
