A within-subject design, preload study was administered to 13 male and 18 female adults (23.7+/-0.9 years old) with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.0+/-0.7 kg/m2. At approximately weekly intervals, participants reported to the lab after an overnight fast and completed questionnaires on mood, appetite, psychological state, strength, and fine motor skills. After administration of motor tasks, participants consumed a 300-kcal preload in its entirety within 10 min.
