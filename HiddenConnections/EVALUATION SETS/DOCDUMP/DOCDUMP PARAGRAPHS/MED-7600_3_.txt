Strawberry supplementation resulted in a greater reduction in oxidative damage to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the LDL fraction (P = .014). At the end of the strawberry period, reductions in LDL cholesterol and in the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were maintained close to 1-year values at -13.4% +/- 2.1% and -15.2% +/- 1.7%, respectively (P < .001), and were similar to the post-oat bran bread values. Strawberries also improved the palatability of the diet.
