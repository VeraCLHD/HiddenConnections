In five normal subjects indomethacin administration abolished the GFR, glucagon, prostaglandin, and albuminuric response to meat ingestion. Glucagon replacement under indomethacin treatment failed to restore these responses. In five diabetic patients, selected for having a flat glucagon and GFR response to a meat meal, replacement of glucagon to postprandial levels increased urinary vasodilatory prostaglandins and restored a normal GFR response.
