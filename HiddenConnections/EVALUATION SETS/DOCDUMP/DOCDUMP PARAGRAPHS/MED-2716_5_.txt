PWV (8.3+/-1.46 versus 9.8+/-2.45 m/s; P<.0001) and EVR (0.63+/-0.21 versus 0.9+/-0.44 m2 x s(-2) x mm Hg(-1); P<.0001) were lower in the garlic group than in the control group. PWV showed significant positive correlation with age (garlic group, r=.44; control group, r=.52) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (garlic group, r=.48; control group, r=.54). With any degree of increase in age or SBP, PWV increased less in the garlic group than in the control group (P<.0001).
