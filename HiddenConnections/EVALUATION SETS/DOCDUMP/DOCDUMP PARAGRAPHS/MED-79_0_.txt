Abstract Current treatment modalities for epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-positive cancers have recently included the use of antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI). A significant limiting step in the use of these agents is dermatological toxicity, frequently in the form of an acneiform eruption. Present management modalities for this toxicity are largely ineffective.
