The average time study participants tolerated head-up tilt was 26% longer after water (41.1+/-8.1 versus 32.6+/-14.3 minutes, mean+/-SD), with a pairwise mean difference of 8.5+/-14.0 minutes (95% CI, 2.3 to 14.7 minutes; P=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Water enhances tolerance of upright posture. The effect of water is mediated by increased peripheral vascular resistance.
