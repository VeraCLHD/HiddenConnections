Raisins were associated with significantly greater changes in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks than snacks (P < 0.05). Body weight did not significantly change within or between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Regular consumption of raisins may reduce glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors, including BP rate.
