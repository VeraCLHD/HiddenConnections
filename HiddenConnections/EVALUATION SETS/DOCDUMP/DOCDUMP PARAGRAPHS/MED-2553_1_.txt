Myosmine is genotoxic in human cells and is readily nitrosated and peroxidated yielding reactive intermediates with carcinogenic potential. For biomonitoring of short-term and long-term exposure, analytical methods were established for determination of myosmine together with nicotine and cotinine in plasma, saliva and toenail by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Validation of the method with samples of 14 smokers and 10 non-smokers showed smoking-dependent differences of myosmine in toenails (66 +/- 56 vs 21 +/- 15 ng g(-1), p <0.01) as well as saliva (2.54 +/- 2.68 vs 0.73 +/- 0.65 ng ml(-1), p <0.01).
