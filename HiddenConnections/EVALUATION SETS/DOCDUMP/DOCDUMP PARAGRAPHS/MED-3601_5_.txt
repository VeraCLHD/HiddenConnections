This was irrespective of study duration (SMD = 0.05, 95%CI -0.10 to 0.20 and SMD = 0, 95%CI -0.08 to 0.08), study size (SMD = 0.05, 95%CI -0.09 to 0.19 and SMD = -0.02, 95%CI -0.10 to 0.05), and whether participants came from countries with low folate status (SMD = 0.14, 95%CI -0.12 to 0.40 and SMD = -0.10, 95%CI -0.23 to 0.04). Supplementation of vitamins B12, B6, and folic acid alone or in combination does not appear to improve cognitive function in individuals with or without existing cognitive impairment. It remains to be established if prolonged treatment with B-vitamins can reduce the risk of dementia in later life.
