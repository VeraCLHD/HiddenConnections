Abstract BACKGROUND: Elevated levels of lipids, such as total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and triglycerides (TG), are widely recognized as risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) is an emerging risk factor considered relevant in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which is implicated in the progression of CVD. Consumption of a diet rich in polyphenols may be cardioprotective through its impact on oxidative stress and protecting LDL from oxidation.
