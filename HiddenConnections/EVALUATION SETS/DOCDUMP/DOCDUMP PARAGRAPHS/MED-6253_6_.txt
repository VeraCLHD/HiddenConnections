Cerebral blood flow was measured using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Peripheral blood flow was determined from changes in the distal to proximal skin temperature gradient and finger pulse volume. Serum melatonin concentration increased from 12 +/- 5 pg/ml at baseline to 487 +/- 377 pg/ml at 5 min and 156 +/- 68 pg/ml at 10 min after melatonin administration.
