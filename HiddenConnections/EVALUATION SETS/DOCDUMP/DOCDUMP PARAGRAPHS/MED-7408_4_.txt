METHODS: Breast cancer incidence rates were calculated by race/ethnicity, age and ER status using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 12 registries for 2000 to 2007. Prevalence of postmenopausal hormone use was calculated using National Health Interview Survey data from 2000, 2005, and 2008. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2007, overall breast cancer incidence rates did not change significantly among NH white women in any age group.
