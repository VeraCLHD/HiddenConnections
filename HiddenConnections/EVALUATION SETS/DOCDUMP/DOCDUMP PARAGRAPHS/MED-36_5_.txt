Both diet periods were 1 month, and fat intake was carefully controlled. RESULTS: Seven-day diet records showed the two diets were similar in energy, macronutrients and fibre. Total cholesterol (mean difference 0.23 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02, 0.43; P=0.03) and triglycerides (mean difference 0.15 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02, 0.31; P=0.017) were significantly lower on the tofu diet than the lean meat diet.
