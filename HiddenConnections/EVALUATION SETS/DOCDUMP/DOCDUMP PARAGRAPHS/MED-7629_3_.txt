Our preclinical work within this scheme includes promising approaches for assessing the chemopreventive potential of berry powder and berry extracts in preclinical model systems; for determining these compoundsâ€™ mechanisms of action; and for identifying the active constituents in berries. The commentary also presents preliminary results of clinical trials in the oral cavity, esophagus and colon using various formulations of freeze-dried berries. The relative merits of berry powders, extracts or individual constituents (anthocyanins) for cancer prevention are also discussed.
