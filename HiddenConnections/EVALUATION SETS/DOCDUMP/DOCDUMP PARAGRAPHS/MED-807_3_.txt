Fasting serum glucose and insulin concentration, glucose to insulin ratio and homoeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index were measured at baseline and again 4 weeks after treatment. Seventy-two patients completed the study and 63 were included in the analysis. After 4 weeks, consumption of 10 g/d BSP resulted in a significant decrease in serum insulin concentration and HOMA-IR (p = 0.05 for treatment effect).
