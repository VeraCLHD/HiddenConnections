In addition, these grape components also suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, but did not induce antioxidant response element-dependent transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that CGE and a component grape anthocyanin have breast cancer chemopreventive potential due in part to their capacity to block carcinogen-DNA adduct formation, modulate activities of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, and suppress ROS in these noncancerous human breast cells.
