Rates of cardiac death and readmission were assessed 1 year following hospitalization. RESULTS: Pet owners were more likely to experience a death or readmission following their hospitalization, after controlling for key psychosocial and medical covariates. When dog and cat owners were considered separately, cat ownership was significantly associated with increased risk of death or readmission.
