Controls were 87 women who delivered a singleton liveborn at Brigham and Women's Hospital during the same period and who experienced less than 20 hours of nausea and fewer than three episodes of vomiting over the duration of their pregnancies. Odds ratios were derived from unconditional logistic regression models using data collected via self-administered food frequency questionnaires. Our results indicate that prepregnancy, high daily intake of total fat increases the risk of severe hyperemesis gravidarum (odds ratio = 2.9 for each 25 gm per day increase; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-6.0).
