DESIGN: Participants were women with invasive ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 who participated in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. Serum samples, collected at diagnosis (n = 670) or after completion of primary treatment and before recurrence (n = 336), were assayed for 25(OH)D. Sociodemographic, dietary, and lifestyle data came from questionnaires self-completed at recruitment, and clinical and survival data were from medical records, supplemented by linkage to the Australian National Death Index (October 2011). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between circulating 25(OH)D and survival.
