Among postmenopausal women only, those in the highest versus lowest quartile of lignan intakes had a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all cause mortality (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26–0.91) and a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer mortality (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11–0.76). Higher intakes of dried beans (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36–1.03), but not fruits, vegetables, or grains, were also weakly associated with overall mortality. In summary, our results suggest that higher lignan intakes may be associated with improved survival among postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
