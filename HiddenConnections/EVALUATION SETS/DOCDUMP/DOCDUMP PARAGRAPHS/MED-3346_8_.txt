In the acute intervention study FVPD were found to increase total plasma nitrate and nitrite (P=0.001) and plasma vitamin C (P=0.002). There was no effect on plasma lipids or uric acid, but there was a lower glucose and insulin peak concentration after consumption of the FVPD compared with the sugar-matched control. There was a trend towards increased vasodilation following both chronic and acute FVPD consumption.
