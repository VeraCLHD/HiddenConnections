Farm-raised catfish not exposed to feed containing ball clay had a mean 2,3,7,8-TCDD concentration of 0.12 pg/g. The TCDD isomer pattern in ball clay differed from the TCDD isomer pattern in a fly ash sample and from the "chick edema factor" TCDD pattern in a sample of reference toxic fat used as a feed ingredient in the 1950s.
