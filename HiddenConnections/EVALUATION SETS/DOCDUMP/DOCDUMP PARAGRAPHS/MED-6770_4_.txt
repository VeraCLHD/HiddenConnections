Because the exhaust stack directly affected the back-door neighbors of these restaurants, we were concerned with the real exposure of groups near the exhaust stack outlets of these restaurants. The ILCRs for total exposure of the neighbors (inhalation+dermal contact+ingestion) were 2.6-31.3, 1.5-14.8, and 1.3-12.2 Ã— 10(-6) in Chinese, Western, and BBQ restaurants, respectively. We suggest that the maximum acceptable exposure time to the exhaust stack outlet area for Chinese, Western, and BBQ restaurants ranges between 5-19, 17-42, and 18-56 h month(-1), respectively, based on an ILCR of less than 10(-6).
