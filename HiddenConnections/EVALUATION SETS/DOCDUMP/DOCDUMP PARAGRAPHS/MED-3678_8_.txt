In PL, incident diabetes was positively associated with the proportions of 16:0 and stearic acid (18:0). CONCLUSIONS: The proportional saturated fatty acid composition of plasma is positively associated with the development of diabetes. Our findings with the use of this biomarker suggest indirectly that the dietary fat profile, particularly that of saturated fat, may contribute to the etiology of diabetes.
