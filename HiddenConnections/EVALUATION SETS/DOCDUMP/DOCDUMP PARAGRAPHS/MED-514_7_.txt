RESULTS: Of the 17 528 subjects, 18% (n=3076) consumed cod liver oil daily for ≥ 1 month over the past year. Cod liver oil intake was significantly associated with incident asthma with an OR of 1.62 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.98) after adjustment for age, sex, daily smoking, physical activity, education, socio-economic status, family history of asthma, and body mass index (BMI). The positive association was consistent across age (< 40/≥ 40 years), sex (men/women), family history of asthma (yes/no) and BMI subgroups (< 25/≥ 25 kg/m(2)).
