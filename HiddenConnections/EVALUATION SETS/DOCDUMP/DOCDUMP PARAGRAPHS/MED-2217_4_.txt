Thereafter, 25(OH)D3 levels were measured and the coronary flow rate was assessed using the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count. Slow coronary flow (SCF) was defined as a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count greater than 27/frame. Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation.
