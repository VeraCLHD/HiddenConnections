In particular, the role of childhood infections has been discussed, but so far these studies have not been conclusive. Recent epidemiological studies and experimental research suggest that the microbial environment and exposure to microbial products in infancy modifies immune responses and enhances the development of tolerance to ubiquitous allergens. The intestinal microflora may play a particular role in this respect, as it is the major external driving force in the maturation of the immune system after birth, and animal experiments have shown it to be a prerequisite for normal development of oral tolerance.
