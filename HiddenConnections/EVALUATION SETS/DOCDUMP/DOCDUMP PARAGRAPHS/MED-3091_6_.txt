After adjustment for body mass index and other potential confounders, relative risks comparing extreme quintiles of the inflammatory dietary pattern were 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22, 1.63; P-trend <.001) for the strict definition and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 1.41; P-trend <.001) for the broader definition of depression. Conclusions The inflammatory dietary pattern is associated with a higher depression risk. This finding suggests that chronic inflammation may underlie the association between diet and depression.
