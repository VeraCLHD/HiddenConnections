Abstract BACKGROUND: Adrenarche is the increase in adrenal androgen (AA) production starting in childhood. Until now, it has been unknown whether or not nutritional factors modulate adrenarche. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine whether body composition and certain dietary intakes are associated with AA production in children after accounting for urinary indicators of major adrenarche-related steroidogenic enzymes.
