Abstract Polyphenol-rich extracts from a range of berries inhibited α-amylase in vitro, but the most effective were from raspberry and rowanberry (IC50 values of 21.0 and 4.5 μg/mL, respectively). The inhibitory components were examined by different approaches. Extracts from yellow and red raspberries were equally able to inhibit α-amylase.
