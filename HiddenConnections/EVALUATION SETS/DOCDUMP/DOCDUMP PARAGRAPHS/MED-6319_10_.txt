Men in the highest third of omega-3 fatty acids had 1.9% (0.4â€“3.5%) higher normal morphology than men in the lowest third (Ptrend = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary cross-sectional study, high intake of saturated fats was negatively related to sperm concentration whereas higher intake of omega-3 fats was positively related to sperm morphology. Further, studies with larger samples are now required to confirm these findings.
