In the second part of the study, PCR detected 36 (18%) positive pigs from alternative housing and 60 (29%) from conventional housing (p<0.05). The highest rate of Y. enterocolitica contamination was found in tonsils (11% alternative, 22% conventional; p<0.05), followed by caecum (5%, 11%) and lymph nodes (2%, 7%). The housing system appears to be one important factor in the prevalence of this common pathogen in pig herds, as we found important differences between the two systems studied here.
