In these studies, greater differences were found between breast-fed and standard formula-fed infants, the latter showing low tissue long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA: arachidonic acid, AA, 20:4n-6; eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, 20:5n-3; docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 22:6n-3) accretion and lower visual and neurodevelopmental test scores. Human milk contains LCPUFA, while most available formulas, especially those intended for full-term infants, do not. With the progressive introduction of solid foods, the question arises whether a specific or "ideal" dietary lipid mixture can be found to meet growth requirements and ensure a lipid balance adequate for the early and effective preventive purposes.
