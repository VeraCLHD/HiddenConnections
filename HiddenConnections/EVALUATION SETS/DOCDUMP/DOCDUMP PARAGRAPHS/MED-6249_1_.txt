Topical application of capsaicin to the human nasal mucosa induced a burning sensation and sneezing. A dose-dependent seromucous nasal secretion was also observed. Capsaicin (75 micrograms) was more potent than methacholine (50 mg) in producing nasal secretion, while topical histamine (200 micrograms), substance P (135 micrograms) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (36 micrograms) did not induce rhinorrhea.
