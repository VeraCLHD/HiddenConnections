Abstract The present study was conducted to determine differences in antioxidant levels of fresh, frozen, and freeze-dried strawberries, and strawberry jam. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity (HAA) and lipophilic antioxidant activity (LAA) were measured using the ABTS/H₂O₂/HRP decoloration method. HAA and LAA were then summed to calculate the total antioxidant activity (TAA).
