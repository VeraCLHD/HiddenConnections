RESULTS: In adolescent boys and girls and older women, significant positive associations were observed between spine size-adjusted bone mineral content (SA-BMC) and fruit intake. In boys only, femoral neck SA-BMC was also significantly and positively associated with the intakes of both fruit and dietary vitamin C. No significant associations were found in the young women or older men, or between bone measurements and intake of vegetables alone (after adjustments) in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Higher fruit and vegetable intakes may have positive effects on bone mineral status in both younger and older age groups, especially at the spine and femoral neck.
