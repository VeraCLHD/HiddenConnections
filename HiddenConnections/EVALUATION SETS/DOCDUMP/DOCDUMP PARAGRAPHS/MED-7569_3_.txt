MRSA isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI and EagI restriction enzymes, and by multi locus sequence typing (MLST). PCR was used to determine SCCmec type and presence of the pvl gene. Results In this pilot study, overall MRSA prevalence in swine was 49% (147/299) and 45% (9/20) in workers.
