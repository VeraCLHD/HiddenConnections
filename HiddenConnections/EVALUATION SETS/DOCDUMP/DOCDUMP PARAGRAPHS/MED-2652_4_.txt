RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis: 13 studies on black tea and 5 studies on green tea. For black tea, no significant association was found through the meta-analysis [highest compared with lowest, summary relative risk (RR): 0.92; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.04; an increment of 1 cup/d, summary RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.02]. For green tea, the summary RR indicated a significant association between the highest green tea consumption and reduced risk of CAD (summary RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.89).
