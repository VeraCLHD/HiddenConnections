The most frequent post-operative complication was bleeding requiring surgical haemostasis. One serious complication occurred after an anastomotic leak from a highly placed anastomosis, resulting in retro rectal, retro- and intra-peritoneal, and mediastinal gas. The patient recovered after conservative treatment and without surgical intervention.
