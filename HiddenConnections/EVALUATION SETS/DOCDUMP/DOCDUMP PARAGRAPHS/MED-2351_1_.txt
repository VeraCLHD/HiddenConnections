We identified, by filipin staining, free cholesterol within hepatocyte lipid droplets in patients with NASH and in C57BL/6J mice that developed NASH following a high-fat high-cholesterol diet. Under polarized light these lipid droplets exhibited strong birefringence suggesting that some of the cholesterol was present in the form of crystals. Activated Kupffer cells aggregated around dead hepatocytes that included strongly birefringent cholesterol crystals, forming “crown-like structures” similar to those recently described in inflamed visceral adipose tissue.
