CONCLUSION: There was considerable heterogeneity in advice on natural food products provided by employees of natural food stores and, in general, these individuals had limited formal training in CAM. The products they recommended had limited evidence supporting their efficacy and in some instances were potentially harmful and had considerable costs. The findings of this study support the need to further examine how best to regulate this growing component of the health care system.
