Addition of raisins to bran flakes (eRB) promoted a less pronounced pH drop beyond 10 minutes when compared to bran flakes alone (P < .001). Consumption of raisins or eRB did not reduce plaque pH below 6 over the 30-minute testing period. CONCLUSION: The ranking in order of study test foods in promoting plaque acidogenicity is: (1) commercial raisin bran cereal; (2) bran flakes; (3) raisins; and (4) experimental raisin bran cereal.
