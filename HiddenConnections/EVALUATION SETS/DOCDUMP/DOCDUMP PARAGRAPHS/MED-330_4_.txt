The patients with NIDDM had the greatest decreases. Insulin was reduced from 40 +/- 15 to 27 +/- 11 microU/ml, blood pressure from 142 +/- 9/83 +/- 3 to 132 +/- 6/71 +/- 3 mm Hg, triglycerides from 353 +/- 76 to 196 +/- 31 mg/dl and body mass index from 31.1 +/- 4.0 to 29.7 +/- 3.7 kg/m2. Although there was a significant weight loss for the group with NIDDM, resulting in the decrease in body mass index, 8 of 9 patients who were initially overweight were still overweight at the end of the program, and 5 of the 8 were still obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2), indicating that normalization of body weight is not a requisite for a reduction or normalization of other risk factors.
