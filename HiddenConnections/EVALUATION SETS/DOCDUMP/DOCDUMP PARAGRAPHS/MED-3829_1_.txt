The patients were divided into three groups: group A (n = 10) had no diabetic neuropathy, group B (n = 8) had diabetic neuropathy with little autonomic neuropathy, and group C (n = 10) had advanced diabetic autonomic neuropathy. In groups A and B, contraction of the gallbladder after egg yolk administration was not significantly different from that of normal subjects. However, in group C, gallbladder contraction was impaired (p less than 0.01-0.05), compared with that in normal subjects.
