Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dietary microparticles, which are bacteria-sized and non-biological, found in the modern Western diet, have been implicated in both the aetiology and pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Following on from the findings of a previous pilot study, we aimed to confirm whether a reduction in the amount of dietary microparticles facilitates induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease, in a single-blind, randomized, multi-centre, placebo controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with active Crohn's disease were randomly allocated in a 2 x 2 factorial design to a diet low or normal in microparticles and/or calcium for 16 weeks.
