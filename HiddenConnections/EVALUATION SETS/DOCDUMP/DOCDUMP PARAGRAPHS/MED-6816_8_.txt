An increase in creatinine-adjusted mercury excretion and suggestive increase in creatinine-adjusted arsenic excretion were noted when Program B was compared to baseline. Urinary mercury/arsenic concentrations were inversely associated with FIQand FibroQuest scores. CONCLUSIONS: Program B was shown to be a safe and efficacious botanically derived medical food treatment program for the amelioration of FM symptoms.
