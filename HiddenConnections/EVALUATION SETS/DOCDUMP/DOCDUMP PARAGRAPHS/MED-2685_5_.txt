RESULTS: Most leaflets (21) promoted milk and water in agreement with nutritional guidelines. Timing of sugary food and drink to mealtimes (25) and decreasing frequency of 'sugary' e.g. non-milk extrinsic (NME) sugar containing foods (22) and drinks (25) reflected guidelines. Inconsistencies were, however, recorded in the leaflets.
