Induced sputum carotenoid levels were significantly lower than plasma and whole blood levels, but correlated strongly with plasma levels (r = 0.798, p < 0.001). Although there were no overall increases in either plasma or sputum lycopene levels following supplementation, changes in airway lycopene levels correlated with changes in plasma levels (r = 0.908, p < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Whole blood, but not plasma or sputum, carotenoid levels are deficient in asthma.
