Incident cancer cases and controls were 1-16 years old and recruited between 1986 and 1989. At diagnosis, age- and sex-adjusted serum concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, zinc, and alpha-tocopherol were significantly inversely associated with cancer. No significant decreases in mean values were observed at 6 month, except for the alpha-tocopherol-to-cholesterol ratio in patients with bone tumors and serum zinc in bone tumors and central nervous system malignancies.
