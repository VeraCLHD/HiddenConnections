Among women, this association was stronger among never users of hormone replacement therapy (RR=0.32) than among ever users (RR=0.81, p-interaction = 0.15). Consumption of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with PD risk. Conclusion Findings from this large prospective study of men and women are consistent with a protective effect of caffeine intake on PD incidence, with an attenuating influence of hormone replacement therapy in women.
