Objectives: We assessed the association between egg intake and incident diabetes in older adults. Design: In this prospective study of 3898 men and women from the Cardiovascular Health Study (1989â€“2007), we assessed egg consumption by using a picture-sorted food questionnaire and ascertained incident T2D annually by using information on hypoglycemic agents and plasma glucose. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted relative risks.
