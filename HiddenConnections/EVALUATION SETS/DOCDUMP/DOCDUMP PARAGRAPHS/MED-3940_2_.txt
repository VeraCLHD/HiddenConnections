Antioxidant, fruit and vegetable intakes were assessed in 278 elderly participants (144 with depression, 134 without depression) using a Block 1998 food frequency questionnaire, which was administered between 1999 and 2007. All participants were age 60 years or over. Vitamin C, lutein and cryptoxanthin intakes were significantly lower among depressed individuals than in comparison participants (p<0.05).
