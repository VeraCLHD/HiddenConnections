Congeners concentrations used were derived from human internal exposure data. Toxicogenomic analysis revealed that all mixtures modulated critical genes involved in genitourinary development, however displaying three different expression profiles. The DL Mix2 modulated actin-related, cell-cell and epithelial-mesenchymal communication morphogenetic processes; Mix1 modulated smooth muscle function genes, whereas Mix3 mainly modulated genes involved in cell metabolism (e.g., steroid and lipid synthesis) and growth.
