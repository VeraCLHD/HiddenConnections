With strain TA100, the inhibitory effects of 5.0 mg of A. awamori-fermented black soybean extract per plate on the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P were 92% and 89%, respectively, while the corresponding rates for extract of unfermented were 41% and 63%, respectively. With strain 98, the inhibition rates were 94 and 81% for the fermented bean extract and 58% and 44% for the unfermented bean extracts. Testing of extracts prepared from black soybean by A. awamori at temperatures 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and for times of 1-5 days revealed that, generally, the extract prepared from beans fermented at 30 degrees C for 3 days exhibited the greatest inhibition against the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO and B[a]P.
