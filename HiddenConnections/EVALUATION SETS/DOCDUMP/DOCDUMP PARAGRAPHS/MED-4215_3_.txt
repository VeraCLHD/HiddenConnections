We further evaluated the influence of a high-fat diet on IMCL storage. In the infusion protocol, 12 healthy male subjects underwent a 6-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp with concomitant infusion of Intralipid plus heparin. IMCL was quantified by (1)H-MRS in soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle at baseline and then every hour.
