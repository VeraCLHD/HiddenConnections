Annual percent change in DDE and PCB-132/153 did not differ significantly by diabetes status. Conclusions This study demonstrates an association between DDE exposure and incident diabetes. The findings of an association of DDE with incident diabetes and the lack of effect of diabetes on annual percent change in POPs do not support the hypothesis that associations of POPs with diabetes are attributable to reverse causality.
