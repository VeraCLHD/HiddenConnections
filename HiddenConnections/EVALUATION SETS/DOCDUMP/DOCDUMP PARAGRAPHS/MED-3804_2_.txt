Moreover, it is not known whether such changes are correlated with indices of odor perception and dementia. To investigate these issues, twelve early stage AD patients and thirteen non-demented controls underwent fMRI while being exposed to each of three concentrations of lavender oil odorant. All participants were administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2), and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR).
