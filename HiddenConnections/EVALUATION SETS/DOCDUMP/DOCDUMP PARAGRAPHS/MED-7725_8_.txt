For bioassays in mice, 50g of the myocardium was digested in an acid pepsin solution and the digest inoculated into mice; the recipient mice were examined for T. gondii infection. In total, 53 isolates of T. gondii were obtained from 68 seropositive lambs. Genotyping of the 53 T. gondii isolates using 10 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism markers (SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1 and Apico) revealed 57 strains with 15 genotypes.
