DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR, 2010, issue 7). STUDY SELECTION: We separated all binary-outcome CDSR forest plots with comparisons of interventions according to whether the first published trial, a subsequent trial (not the first), or no trial had a nominally statistically significant (P < .05) very large effect (odds ratio [OR], â‰¥5). We also sampled randomly 250 topics from each group for further in-depth evaluation.
