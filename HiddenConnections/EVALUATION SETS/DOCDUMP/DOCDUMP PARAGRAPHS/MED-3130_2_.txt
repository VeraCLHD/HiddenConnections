The hypothesis that patient self-report of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased in individuals receiving calcium supplementation is because of an increase in non-MI events incorrectly perceived by the patient as being because of MI, is examined. In seven RCTs summary self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event rates were more common in participants receiving calcium. These were described as constipation, excessive abdominal cramping, bloating, upper GI events, GI disease, GI symptoms, and severe diarrhoea or abdominal pain (calcium 14.1%, placebo 10.0%), relative risk (RR) 1.43 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.59, p < 0.001.
