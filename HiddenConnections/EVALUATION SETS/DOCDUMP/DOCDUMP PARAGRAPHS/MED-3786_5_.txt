In addition, we searched several conference proceedings (from 2000 to either 2010 or 2011) and reference lists of relevant articles. To identify ongoing trials we contacted researchers working on this topic and we scanned the National Institute of Health Register and the ISRCTN Register (www.controlled-trials.com; searched May 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of an LBD with a control diet with regard to infection rate, (infection-related) mortality, time to first febrile episode, need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability, and quality of life in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia.
