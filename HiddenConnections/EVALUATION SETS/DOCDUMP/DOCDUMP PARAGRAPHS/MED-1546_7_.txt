The highest bacterial titres were recorded for the control population, while each drinking habit subgroup showed counts roughly one log lower than the controls. These differences in bacterial counts proved statistically significant (P<0.05). As far as dental plaque was concerned, while total counts did not significantly vary per mg of plaque in the subjects belonging to the different drinking habit subgroups, a significant decrease (P<0.05) was observed in those subjects drinking coffee, tea, barley coffee and wine when mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were evaluated.
