Soy protein supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in mean serum total cholesterol (-5.26 mg/dl, 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.14 to -3.38), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-4.25 mg/dl, 95% CI -6.00 to -2.50), and triglycerides (-6.26 mg/dl, 95% CI -9.14 to -3.38) and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.77 mg/dl, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.34). Meta-regression analyses showed a dose-response relation between soy protein and isoflavone supplementation and net changes in serum lipids. These results indicate that soy protein supplementation reduces serum lipids among adults with or without hypercholesterolemia.
