Results Subjects' compliance to the fast was 98.7 ± 0.2% (mean ± SEM). Using a 10 point scale, subjects' mood and satiety were both 7.9 ± 0.2. The following variables were significantly (p < 0.05) lower following the fast as compared to before the fast: white blood cell count (5.68 ± 0.24 vs. 4.99 ± 0.19 103·μL-1), blood urea nitrogen (13.07 ± 0.58 vs. 10.14 ± 0.59 mg·dL-1), blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (14.74 ± 0.59 vs. 11.67 ± 0.68), protein (6.95 ± 0.07 vs. 6.77 ± 0.06 g·dL-1), total cholesterol (171.07 ± 4.57 vs. 138.69 ± 4.39 mg·dL-1), LDL-C (98.38 ± 3.89 vs. 76.07 ± 3.53 mg·dL-1), HDL-C (55.65 ± 2.50 vs. 47.58 ± 2.19 mg·dL-1), SBP (114.65 ± 2.34 vs. 105.93 ± 2.12 mmHg), and DBP (72.23 ± 1.59 vs. 67.00 ± 1.43 mmHg).
