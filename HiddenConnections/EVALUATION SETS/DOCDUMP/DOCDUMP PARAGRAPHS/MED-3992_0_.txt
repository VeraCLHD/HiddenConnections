Abstract One hundred adult patients attending for day case surgery were surveyed by anonymous questionnaire in order to determine their attitudes to rectal drug administration. Fifty four patients did not want an analgesic drug (diclofenac sodium) administered rectally whilst under anaesthesia, all preferring to take it orally if available. Ninety eight patients thought that drugs administered per rectum should always be discussed with them beforehand and a few had very strong feelings about this route of administration.
