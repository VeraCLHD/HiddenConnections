Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether selective reduction of postchallenge hyperglycaemia influences acute endothelial dysfunction, a very early manifestation of vascular disease, in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study the acute effect of 200-mg acarbose was investigated in 28 subjects with diagnosed impaired glucose tolerance. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was determined as a measure of endothelial function before and 2 and 3 h after ingestion of 100-g saccharose.
