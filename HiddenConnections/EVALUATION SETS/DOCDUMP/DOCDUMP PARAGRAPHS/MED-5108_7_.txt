RESULTS: Alpha-Gal specific IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgA titers remained unvaried within a narrow range upon longitudinal observation. Most probands did not display alpha-Gal specific IgE ABs. Crohn's disease patients showed highly increased alpha-Gal-specific IgA titers compared with control subjects (P<.01).
