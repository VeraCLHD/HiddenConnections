SETTING AND SUBJECTS: In total, 24 tea drinkers (> or = 1 l black tea/day) and 28 non-tea drinkers were recruited from the staff and students of King's College London by circular email. RESULTS: Dietary Mn intakes (mean (range)) were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in non tea drinkers (3.2 mg/day (0.5-6.5)) than tea drinkers (5.5 mg/day (2-12) or 10 mg/day (5-20) depending upon the value used for Mn levels of black tea). Whole blood, plasma Mn levels and expression of MnSOD and cAP-P did not differ between the groups.
