Abstract Campylobacteriosis is the most common antecedent infection leading to the development of inflammatory neuropathies including Guillain Barr√© syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), with alterations in surface proteins and genetic polymorphisms conferring increased risk. Poultry is the most common source of C. jejuni infection in industrialized countries, including the US. There are no data on the prevalence on consumer poultry products of various strains of C. jejuni, including those hypothesized to be associated with neuropathy.
