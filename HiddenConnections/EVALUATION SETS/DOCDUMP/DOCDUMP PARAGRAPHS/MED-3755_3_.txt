Optimization of structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetic properties led to sildenafil, which proved essentially devoid of cardiovascular activity in clinical trials. However, the emerging role of nitric oxide and cGMP in controlling blood flow in the penis suggested that sildenafil would have a beneficial effect on erectile function. This hypothesis was confirmed by extensive clinical trials in nearly 5000 patients and the Food and Drug Administration approved sildenafil in March 1998 for male erectile dysfunction.
