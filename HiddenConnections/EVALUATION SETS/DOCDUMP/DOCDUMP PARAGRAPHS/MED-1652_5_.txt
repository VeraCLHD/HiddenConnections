An epidemic of neurological toxicity was reported in France in the 1970's with prolonged bismuth treatment, usually bismuth subgallate and subnitrate. Such toxicity has been rare with bismuth subsalicylate and colloidal bismuth subcitrate. However, recent studies have demonstrated intestinal absorption of bismuth (about 0.2% of the ingested dose) and sequestration of this heavy metal in multiple tissue sites, even occurring with conventional dosing over a 6-week period.
