Abstract A growing body of evidence from clinical trials and epidemiological studies has identified elevated resting heart rate as a predictor of clinical events. Proof of direct cause and effect is limited, because current drugs that lower heart rate (eg, beta-blockers) have multiple mechanisms of action. A new class of drug, selective If inhibitors, is under investigation as a ‘pure’ heart rate-reducing medication and will help confirm if there is a causal link between elevated heart rate and cardiovascular outcomes.
