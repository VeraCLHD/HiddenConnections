Results: AGDAS, but not AGDAP, was associated with sperm concentration, motility, morphology, total sperm count, and total motile count (p-values, 0.002–0.048). Men with AGDAS below (vs. above) the median were 7.3 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 2.5–21.6) to have a low sperm concentration (< 20 × 106/mL). For a typical study participant, sperm concentrations were 34.7 × 106/mL and 51.6 × 106/mL at the 25th and 75th percentiles of (adjusted) AGDAS.
