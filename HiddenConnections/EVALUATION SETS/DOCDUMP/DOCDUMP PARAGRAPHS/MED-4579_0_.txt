Abstract Background There are conflicting reports and a lack of evidence-based data regarding effects of medications on cognition in cognitively normal older adults. We explored whether use of 100 common medications taken by older adults is associated with longitudinal cognitive performance. Methods A longitudinal observational cohort was used with analysis of data collected September 2005 through May 2011 and maintained in the National Alzheimerâ€™s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set.
