Abstract AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although hyperinsulinaemia in Type 2 diabetes in states of insulin resistance is a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that insulin increases monocyte-endothelial interactions, which are implicated in atherosclerosis. METHODS: We treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with insulin (10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/l) for 0 to 24 h. To dissect potentially implicated signal transduction pathways, we treated endothelial cells with known pharmacological inhibitors of two distinct insulin signalling pathways: the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3'-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin (3 x 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l), involved in insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase stimulation, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein (p38MAP) kinase inhibitor SB-203580 (10(-7) to 2 x 10(-6) mol/l).
