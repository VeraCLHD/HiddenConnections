However, the mechanism of reduced mRNA and protein expression is yet not fully elucidated. This study aims to assess BRCA1 protein expression and the role of BRCA1 promoter methylation in sporadic breast cancer in North Indian population and to correlate these with known prognostic factors and molecular profiles of breast cancer. BRCA1 protein expression was normal (>50 % tumour cells) in 41 (43 %) cases, reduced (20-50 % tumour cells) in 33 (35 %) cases and absent/markedly reduced (<20 % tumour cells) in 21 (22.1 %) cases.
