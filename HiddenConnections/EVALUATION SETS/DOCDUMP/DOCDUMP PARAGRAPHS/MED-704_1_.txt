To establish that the gut, rather than circulating steroid precursors, is the source of bile acids in breast cyst fluid, we gave two patients deuterium-labelled chenodeoxycholic acid (three 200 mg doses by mouth), starting 9 days before aspiration of breast cysts. The chenodeoxycholic acid concentration of seven samples of aspirated cyst fluid ranged from 42 to 94 mumol/L. The corresponding serum concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid on the same day were 0.8 and 2.9 mumol/L, of which the labelled compound comprised 13.0% (0.38 mumol/L) and 28.2% (0.23 mumol/L).
