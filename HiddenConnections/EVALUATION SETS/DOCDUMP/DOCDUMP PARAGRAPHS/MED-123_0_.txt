Abstract BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the association between regular physical activity and mental disorders among adults in the United States. METHODS: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to compare the prevalence of mental disorders among those who did and did not report regular physical activity using data from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 8098), a nationally representative sample of adults ages 15-54 in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Slightly over one-half of adults reported regular physical activity (60.3%).
