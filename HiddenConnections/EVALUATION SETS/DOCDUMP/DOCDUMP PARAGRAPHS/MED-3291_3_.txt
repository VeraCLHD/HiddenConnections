In this model, tangles develop independently but relatively slowly during aging; these represent neurodegeneration, but by themselves may not represent AD. In contrast, amyloid may be the driving factor in AD, exacerbating neurofibrillary changes and other neurodegeneration. There is a pre-clinical period when the process has begun but has not produced sufficient degeneration to produce clinical symptoms.
