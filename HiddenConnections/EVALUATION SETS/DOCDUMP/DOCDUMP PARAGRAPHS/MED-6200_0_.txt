Abstract OBJECTIVE: This study investigated how consumption of orange juice associated with aerobic training affected serum lipids and physical characteristics of overweight, middle-aged women. METHODS: The experimental group consisted of 13 women who consumed 500 mL/d of orange juice and did 1h aerobic training 3 times a week for 3 months. The control group consisted of another 13 women who did the same aerobic training program but did not consume orange juice.
