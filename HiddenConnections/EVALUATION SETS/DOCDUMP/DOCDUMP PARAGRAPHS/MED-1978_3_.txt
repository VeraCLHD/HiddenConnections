No other food groups were associated with PD risk in either men or women. Further analyses among men showed significant positive associations with PD risk for intakes of several dairy foods as well as dairy calcium (RR, 1.5; p trend = 0.02), dairy vitamin D (RR, 1.6; p trend = 0.004), dairy protein (RR, 1.6; p trend = 0.01), and lactose (RR, 1.8; p trend = 0.002), but not dairy fat (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.4). Intakes of calcium, vitamin D, and protein from other dietary or supplemental sources were not related to PD risk in men.
