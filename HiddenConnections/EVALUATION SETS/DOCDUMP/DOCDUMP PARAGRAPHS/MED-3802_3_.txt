In this study, we examined possible relationships between age and olfactory abilities in healthy Japanese subjects (control subjects) over a wide range of ages and compared this relationship with that observed in three neurodegenerative disorders; patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In control subjects, both threshold and recognition abilities decreased with age. Ability to detect odors was generally intact in most control subjects, however, we found that the abilities of individuals in the three different patient populations to recognize odors were impaired relative to control subjects.
