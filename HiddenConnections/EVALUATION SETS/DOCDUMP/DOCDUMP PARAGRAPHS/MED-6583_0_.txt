Abstract The regular occurrence of a peak due to an unidentified substance (X) in the gas chromatographic traces obtained from phenolic extracts of urine from human pregnant and non-pregnant females has been reported. The biphasic excretion of X with maxima in the luteal phase of the ovulatory cycle and relatively high levels in the first trimester of pregnancy were noteworthy and suggested that the substance may have a biological significance. Close similarities between the excretory pattern, the chemical and chromatographic properties of X and of those of the known phenolic steroids suggested initially that this compound was steroidal in nature.
