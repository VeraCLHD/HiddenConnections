As plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in Greenland Eskimos in a previous study were found markedly lower than those found in Western populations, and as coronary atherosclerosis seems to occur far less commonly among Eskimos in Greenland than among peoples in industrialized countries, it was found difficult to combine these observations with the results from the present study. If dietary differences are the main reason for the differences in plasma lipid concentrations, the results from the present study point more toward qualitative than toward quantitative differences in respect of fatty acid composition of the food.
