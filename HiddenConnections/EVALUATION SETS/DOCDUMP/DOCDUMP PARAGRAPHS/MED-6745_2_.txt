The test foods were apples, oranges, grapes, carrots, and tomatoes, consumed either whole (sugars located intrinsically) or as a juice (extrinsic or free sugars). Raisins containing 64% sugars, but intrinsic by definition, were also studied. The mineral profile of the enamel slabs was studied before and after the test period using transverse microradiography and showed further demineralisation for all test foods, irrespective of the form of consumption.
