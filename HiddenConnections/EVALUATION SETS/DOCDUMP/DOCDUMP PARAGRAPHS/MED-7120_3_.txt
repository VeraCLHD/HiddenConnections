Mercury concentrations were determined in cord blood and maternal hair, and in the child's hair at ages 7 and 14. RESULTS: Latencies of peaks III and V increased by about 0.012 ms when the cord blood mercury concentration doubled. As seen at age 7 years, this effect appeared mainly within the I-III interpeak interval.
