Starting from zaprinast, a weak phosphodiesterase inhibitor, computer modelling guided rational medicinal chemistry to achieve significant increases in potency and selectivity for the 5-isoenzyme within a novel series of pyrazolopyrimidinones. Optimization of structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetic properties led to sildenafil, which proved essentially devoid of cardiovascular activity in clinical trials. However, the emerging role of nitric oxide and cGMP in controlling blood flow in the penis suggested that sildenafil would have a beneficial effect on erectile function.
