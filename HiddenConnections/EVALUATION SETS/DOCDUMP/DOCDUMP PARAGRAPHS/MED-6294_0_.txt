Abstract The definition of cervical neoplasia as a sexually determined disease caused by some types of human papillomavirus has been widely accepted. Recent epidemiologic studies, however, have failed to identify a correlation between sexual activity and human papillomavirus infection. Moreover, sexual activity has also been shown to be independent of human papillomavirus infection in increasing cervical cancer risk.
