We propose to determine the chronic effect of three diets with different fat compositions on postprandial endothelial function and inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty healthy men followed three 4-week diets in a randomised cross-over design: a Western diet, rich in saturated fat (22% SFA, 12% MUFA and 0.4% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), all fractions are % of energy); a Mediterranean diet, rich in MUFA ( < 10 % SFA, 24 % MUFA and 0.4% ALA); a low-fat diet enriched in ALA ( < 10% SFA, 12% MUFA and 2% ALA). At the end of each dietary period all subjects underwent a postprandial study.
