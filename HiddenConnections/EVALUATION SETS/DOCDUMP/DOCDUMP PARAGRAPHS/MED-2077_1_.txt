ZEN and its derivatives share similar molecular mechanisms and activity with estrogens and interact with ERα and ERβ leading to changes in the reproductive system in both animals and humans. The reduced form of ZEN, α-ZEA ralenol, has been used as an anabolic agent for animals and also proposed as hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, both zearelanol ZEN and derivatives have been patented as oral contraceptives.
