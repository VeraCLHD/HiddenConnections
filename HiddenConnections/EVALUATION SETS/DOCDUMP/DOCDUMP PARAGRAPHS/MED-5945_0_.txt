Abstract PURPOSE: Components of one-carbon metabolism are believed to influence cancer development with suggested mechanisms, including DNA methylation and DNA repair mechanisms. However, few prospective studies have investigated one-carbon metabolism in relation to prostate cancer risk, and the results have been conflicting. The aim of this study was to do a comprehensive investigation of the components of one-carbon metabolism in relation to prostate cancer risk.
