RESULTS: Two case control and 15 cohort studies were selected out of 3488 retrieved abstracts. A higher risk of major congenital malformations was observed in offspring of women with gestational diabetes with the following relative risk (RR)/odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI): RR 1.16 (1.07-1.25) in cohort studies and OR 1.4 (1.22-1.62) in case control studies. Risk of major congenital malformations was much higher in offspring of women with PGDM than in those of the reference group: RR 2.66 (2.04-3.47) in cohort studies and OR 4.7 (3.01-6.95) in the single case control study providing information.
