The lowest prevalence of asthma and sensitization to dietary allergens was detected in those born in 1943-46, i.e. during or immediately after World War II. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of sensitization to airborne allergens, unlike that to dietary allergens, has increased over a long period of time. Our results support the concept of the immune function being programmed by external factors early in life.
