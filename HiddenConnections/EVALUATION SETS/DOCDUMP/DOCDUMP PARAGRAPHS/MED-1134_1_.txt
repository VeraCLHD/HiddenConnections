This study assessed the knowledge of a random population of 2,305 individuals comprising members of the public, health care workers, university graduate students, and health club attendees. Segments of this population might be expected to have a greater understanding and ability to implement these dietary recommendations. We found that over 90% of the participants were unaware of the recommendations for calcium, salt, vitamin A, and fiber, and the fiber content in a high fiber cereal.
