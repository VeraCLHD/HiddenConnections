To overcome this problem, we developed a new form of curcumin (Theracurmin) and reported high plasma curcumin levels could be safely achieved after a single administration of Theracurmin in healthy volunteers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety of repetitive administration of Theracurmin in cancer patients. METHODS: Pancreatic or biliary tract cancer patients who failed standard chemotherapy were eligible for this study.
