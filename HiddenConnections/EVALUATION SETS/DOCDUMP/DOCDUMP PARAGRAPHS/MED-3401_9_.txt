Our results show that removal of soluble protein and denaturation of membrane proteins enhances the partition of carotenoids into oil. For both vegetables there is no evidence of preference in the extent of transfer of one carotenoid over another. This suggests that partitioning into oil under gastric conditions is not the stage of digestion that could lead to differences in carotenoid bioavailability.
