The incidence of SCF was significantly higher in the VD-insufficient group than in patients with sufficient VD (relative risk=3.5, 95% confidence interval=1.1-10.5, P=0.01). After adjusting for cardiovascular disease risk factors, VD insufficiency was independently associated with SCF. The linear regression analysis showed that VD insufficiency was correlated independently with % flow-mediated dilatation (β=0.424, P<0.001) and carotid intima-media thickness (β=0.43, P<0.001).
