Although there was no association between urinary PGE-M and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in the overall analysis or among regular users of NSAIDs, there was a positive association among postmenopausal women who did not regularly use NSAIDs with HRs of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.0–4.3); 2.0 (95% CI: 1.0–3.9); and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.1–4.3) for the second, third, and highest quartiles of PGE-M. Our findings suggest a link between systemic PGE2 formation and postmenopausal breast cancer, and a possible modification of the association by lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. If confirmed in larger studies, these results may have useful implications for the development of preventive strategies.
