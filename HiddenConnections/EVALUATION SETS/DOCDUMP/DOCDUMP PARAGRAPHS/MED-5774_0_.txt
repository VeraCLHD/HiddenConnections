Abstract Detailed clinical and neuropathological studies have been made in two fullterm newborn human infants who were exposed to methylmercury in utero as a result of maternal ingestion of methylmercury-contaminated bread in early phases of pregnancy. High levels of mercury were detected in various regions of the brain at autopsy. Study of the brains revealed a disturbance in the development in both cases, consisting essentially of an incomplete or abnormal migration of neurons to the cerebellar and cerebral cortices, and deranged cortical organization of the cerebrum.
