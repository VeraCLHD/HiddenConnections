The highest soy isoflavone was associated with a decreased death risk of breast cancer (OR=0.25, 95% CI=0.09-0.54). Moreover, the higher consumption of soy protein also presented a trend decreased breast cancer risk, and the highest consumption significantly reduced the cancer risk compared with the lowest consumption (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.17-0.86). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests soy intake is associated with a significant reduced death risk of breast cancer in Chinese population.
