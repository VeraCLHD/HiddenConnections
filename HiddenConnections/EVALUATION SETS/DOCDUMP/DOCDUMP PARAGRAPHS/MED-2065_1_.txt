Although a number of health effects are attributed to these compounds, only a few reports are available about the bioavailability of prenylflavonoids and the transformation potency of the intestinal microbial community. To test these transformations, four fecal samples were incubated with xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol (IX), and 8-PN. Upon incubation with IX, present in strong ales up to 4 mg/L, 36% was converted into 8-PN in one fecal sample and the estrogenic properties of the sample drastically increased.
