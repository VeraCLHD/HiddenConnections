Abstract A significant interaction among total serum cholesterol (TC), APOE genotype, and AD risk was found in a population-based study of elderly African Americans. Increasing TC was associated with increased AD risk in the group with no epsilon4 alleles, whereas TC was not associated with increased AD risk in the group with one or more epsilon4 alleles. Further study of the relationship between cholesterol and APOE genotype is needed to confirm this association, but the results suggest that cholesterol may be a potentially modifiable environmental risk factor for AD.
