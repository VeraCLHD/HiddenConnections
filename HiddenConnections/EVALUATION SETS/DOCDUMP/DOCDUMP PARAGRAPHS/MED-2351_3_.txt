Activated Kupffer cells aggregated around dead hepatocytes that included strongly birefringent cholesterol crystals, forming “crown-like structures” similar to those recently described in inflamed visceral adipose tissue. These Kupffer cells appeared to process the lipid of dead hepatocytes turning it into activated lipid-laden “foam cells” with numerous small cholesterol-containing droplets. In contrast, hepatocyte lipid droplets in patients and mice with simple steatosis did not exhibit cholesterol crystals and their Kupffer cells did not form crown-like structures or transform into foam cells.
