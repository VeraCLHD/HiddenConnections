This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, during 2009-2010, approximately 11% of those with prediabetes were aware of their condition. Furthermore, during 2005-2010, estimated awareness of prediabetes was <14% across all population subgroups, different levels of health-care access or use, and other factors. In the United States, persons with prediabetes, including those with regular access to health care, might benefit from efforts aimed at making them aware that they are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes and that they can reduce that risk by making modest lifestyle changes.
