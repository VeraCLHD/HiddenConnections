A specific HPLC assay for betacyanins, the red beetroot pigments, in biological fluids was developed to study the prevalence of this apparent polymorphism in humans, and to investigate its basis in rats. Two major peaks were observed in chromatograms of extracts of unpickled beetroot. They had identical UV absorption spectra (lambda max = 535 nm) by diode array analysis, and mass spectrometry indicated that one (betacyanin 1) was betanin or its epimer and the other (betacyanin 2) a disaccharide of betacyanin 1.
