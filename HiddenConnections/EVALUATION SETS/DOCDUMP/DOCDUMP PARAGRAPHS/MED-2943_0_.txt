Abstract Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) influences the risk of late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an isoform-dependent manner, such that the presence of the apoE epsilon4 allele increases the risk of AD while the presence of the apoE epsilon2 allele appears to be protective. Although a number of ApoE functions are isoform dependent and may underlie the "risk factor" activity of AD, its ability to bind amyloid beta peptides and influence their clearance and/or deposition has gained strong experimental support. Evidence suggests that in addition to genotype, increased ApoE transcription can contribute to AD risk.
