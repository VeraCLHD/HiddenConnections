Of the patients who were randomized to a vegetarian diet, there was no significant difference between diet responders and diet non-responders with regard to the MHLCS scores.

The psychological distress imposed on the patients by changing from an omnivorous diet to a vegetarian diet was monitored during the clinical trial by means of the General Health Questionnaire.
