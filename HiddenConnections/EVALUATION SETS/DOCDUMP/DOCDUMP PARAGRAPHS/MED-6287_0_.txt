Abstract Studies have shown that fisetin, a small phytochemical molecule, has antitumor activity; however, its antiangiogenic activity has not yet been examined. Accordingly, herein, we investigated the antiangiogenic efficacy and associated mechanisms of fisetin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Fisetin (10-50 Î¼M) strongly inhibited the regular serum plus growth supplement- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced growth (up to 92%, P < 0.001) and survival (up to 16%, P < 0.001) of HUVEC in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
