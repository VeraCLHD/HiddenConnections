Abstract Telomerases constitute a group of specialized ribonucleoprotein enzymes that remediate chromosomal shrinkage resulting from the “end-replication” problem. Defects in telomere length regulation are associated with several diseases as well as with aging and cancer. Despite significant progress in understanding the roles of telomerase, the complete structure of the human telomerase enzyme bound to telomeric DNA remains elusive, with the detailed molecular mechanism of telomere elongation still unknown.
