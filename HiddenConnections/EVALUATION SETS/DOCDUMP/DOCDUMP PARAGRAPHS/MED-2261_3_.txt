In a postal questionnaire, men were asked to balance absence or presence of certain therapy-induced long-term symptoms against varying lengths of survival gain as a consequence of the therapy. RESULTS: Information was provided by 511 (86%) of the 591 men. A large majority of the men participating in this study ended up in one of two extreme categories: either they accepted the therapy-induced symptom to gain survival or they did not.
