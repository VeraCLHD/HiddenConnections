We review the evidence and pathophysiology linking ED to cardiovascular disease, and then describe how to carry out a basic cardiovascular evaluation. We present data from the literature showing that appropriate use of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy has a positive effect on mortality, on numerous cardiovascular end points and on ED. Suggestions of when to refer the ED patient to an internist or cardiologist are provided.
