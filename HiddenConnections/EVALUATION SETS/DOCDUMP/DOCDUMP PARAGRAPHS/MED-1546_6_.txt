Total bacteria, total streptococci, S. mutans and lactobacilli counts were determined by culture in both saliva and dental plaque. The highest bacterial titres were recorded for the control population, while each drinking habit subgroup showed counts roughly one log lower than the controls. These differences in bacterial counts proved statistically significant (P<0.05).
