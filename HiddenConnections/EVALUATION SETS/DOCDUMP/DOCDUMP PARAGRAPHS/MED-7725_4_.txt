Sera were first screened using 1:25, 1:50, 1: 100 and 1:200 dilutions, and hearts were selected for bioassay for T. gondii. Antibodies (MAT, 1:25 or higher) to T. gondii were found in 104 (27.1%) of 383 lambs. Hearts of 68 seropositive lambs were used for isolation of viable T. gondii by bioassay in cats, mice or both.
