The FISH technique revealed the appearance of an acrocentric signal in mate-induced micronuclei, which suggests that under these conditions yerba mate extract may display aneugenic activity. Since caffeine is one of the most abundant compounds found in the dry mass of mate, we conducted additional experiments with caffeine alone. We showed that caffeine used at the same concentrations manifests a more potent cyto- and genotoxic effect that may account, at least in part, for the disadvantageous effects observed for yerba mate extract.
