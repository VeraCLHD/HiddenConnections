After adjudication the MI rates were 2.4% in the calcium group and 1.6% in the placebo group (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.88-2.45, p = 0.145). These data support the hypothesis that calcium tablets increase the incidence of adverse GI events, which may account for an increase in self-reported MI in calcium treated patients but not controls.
