RESULTS—FMD did not change significantly after the MUFA-rich meal but declined after the SAFA-rich meal. The FMD during the experiment, expressed as incremental area under the curve, increased after the MUFA-rich meal by 5.2 ± 2.5% and decreased after the SAFA-rich meal by 16.7 ± 6.0% (Δ = −11.5 ± 6.4%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS—Consumption of an SAFA-rich meal is harmful for the endothelium, while a MUFA-rich meal does not impair endothelial function in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
