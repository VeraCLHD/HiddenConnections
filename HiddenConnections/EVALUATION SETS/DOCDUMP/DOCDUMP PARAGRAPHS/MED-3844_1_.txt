The three mixtures feature congeners grouped according to potentially shared modes of action: one dioxin-like (DL) (Mix2) and two non dioxin-like (NDL) mixtures featuring congeners defined as estrogenic (Mix1) and highly persistent-cytochrome P-450 inducers (Mix3). Congeners concentrations used were derived from human internal exposure data. Toxicogenomic analysis revealed that all mixtures modulated critical genes involved in genitourinary development, however displaying three different expression profiles.
