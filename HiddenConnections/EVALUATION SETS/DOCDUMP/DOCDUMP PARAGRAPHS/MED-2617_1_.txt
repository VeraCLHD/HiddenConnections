Method On three test days, 32 healthy females consumed a standard breakfast followed by 0, 28 or 42Â g of almonds as a mid-morning snack and then ad libitum meals at lunch and dinner. The effect of the almond snacks on satiety was assessed by measuring energy intake (kcal) at the two ad libitum meals and subjective appetite ratings (visual analogue scales) throughout the test days. Results Intake at lunch and dinner significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in response to the almond snacks.
