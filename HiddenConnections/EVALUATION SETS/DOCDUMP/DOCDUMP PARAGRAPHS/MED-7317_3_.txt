METHODS: The GWTG database was analyzed for ACS-related hospitalizations from 2005 to 2009. The use of LLT (defined as dose of statin or combination therapy likely to produce>50% reductions in low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) and less intensive LLT at discharge was assessed. Baseline characteristics and temporal trends in LLT were compared in these 2 treatment groups.
