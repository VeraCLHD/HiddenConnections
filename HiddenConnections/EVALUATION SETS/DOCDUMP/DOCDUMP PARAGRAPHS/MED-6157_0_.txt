Abstract The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible underlying pathogenesis of erectile dysfunction(ED) in young men with low risk of coronary heart disease and no well-known aetiology. To conduct this study, 122 patients with ED under the age of 40 were enrolled, along with 33 age-matched normal control subjects. The patients with ED had significantly higher levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol and triglyceride, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), greater carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and Framingham risk score (FRS) than the control group, though all of these values were within the respective normal range.
