In patients with massive loss of small intestine, short chain fatty acid production supports survival by releasing up to 1000 kcal energy/day. Human studies show that the microbiota synthesizes a large pool of utilizable folate which may support survival in impoverished populations. Unfortunately, the microbiota may also elaborate toxic products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulfide by sulfur-reducing bacteria in response to a high-meat diet.
