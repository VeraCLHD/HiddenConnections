Therefore, setting temperature affected the property of gels added with MTGase. Gel properties of mince obtained from lizardfish stored in ice for different times (0 to 10 d) with and without MTGase at a level 0.6 units/g were determined. Irrespective of MTGase addition, breaking force and deformation of all gels decreased as the storage time of lizardfish increased (P<0.05).
