A punch biopsy revealed a superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and many eosinophils. Most notably, there was a parasite centered in the reticular dermis with prominent lateral chords, a well-developed muscular esophagus, and an intestine that contained a brush border and multinucleate cells. Evaluation of these histological sections by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the parasite to be a nematode of the genus Gnathostoma.
