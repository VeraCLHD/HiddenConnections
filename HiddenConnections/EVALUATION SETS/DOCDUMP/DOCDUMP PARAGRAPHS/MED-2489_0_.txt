Abstract AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that plays a major role in the maintenance of energy homeostasis in various organs and tissues. When activated, AMPK can induce substrate catabolism and shut down energy-consuming anabolic pathways to increase intracellular ATP availability. Even though most of these effects have been described in muscle and liver, several studies have provided compelling evidence that AMPK also plays an important role in the regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) glucose and lipid metabolism.
