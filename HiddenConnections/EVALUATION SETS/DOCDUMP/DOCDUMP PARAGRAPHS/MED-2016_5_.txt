Twelve studies included secondary evaluations of BPA exposure and BMI, and six studies evaluated body composition as the primary outcome. All analyses were cross-sectional and no study included in the review received a positive quality rating (twelve negative, six neutral). Eight studies observed a statistically significant positive association between urinary or serum BPA levels and BMI, and ten studies observed no association.
