Even small levels of misclassification can considerably distort (1) the presumed prevalence of viral infection, (2) the association between sexual activity and human papillomavirus infection, and (3) the ability to control the relation between sexual activity and cancer by human papillomavirus infection. In field surveys, the presumed rates of human papillomavirus infection based on a DNA assay such as the filter in situ hybridization may be a gross overestimation of the true viral prevalence. Use of moderately misclassified human papillomavirus infection test results for effect estimation and covariate adjustment in data analysis may seriously distort the underlying relations.
