In the case of several processes, although it is clear that they are regulated by mTORC1, it is not known how mTORC1 does this. Lastly, mTORC1 is implicated in ageing, but again it is unclear what mechanisms account for this. Given the importance of mTORC1 signaling both for cellular functions and in human disease, it is a high priority to gain further insights into the control of mTORC1 signaling and the mechanisms by which it controls cellular functions and animal physiology.
