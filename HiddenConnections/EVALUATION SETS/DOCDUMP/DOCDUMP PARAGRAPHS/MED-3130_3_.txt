In seven RCTs summary self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event rates were more common in participants receiving calcium. These were described as constipation, excessive abdominal cramping, bloating, upper GI events, GI disease, GI symptoms, and severe diarrhoea or abdominal pain (calcium 14.1%, placebo 10.0%), relative risk (RR) 1.43 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.59, p < 0.001. Adjudicated functional GI hospitalizations in one study were calcium 6.8%, placebo 3.6% (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.21-3.05, p = 0.006).
