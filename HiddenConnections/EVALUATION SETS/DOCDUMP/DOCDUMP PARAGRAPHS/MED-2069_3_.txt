Because levels of circulating steroid hormones failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the feminization observed, alternate explanations were considered. If the estrogenization observed was not entirely a function of tissue expose to steroid estrogens produced endogenously, then perhaps tissues were being exposed to exogenous estrogenic substances from dietary sources. Given the degree of alcohol abuse in the population in which hypotheses for feminization were being formed, alcoholic beverages became a prime candidate as a dietary source of exogenous estrogenic substances.
