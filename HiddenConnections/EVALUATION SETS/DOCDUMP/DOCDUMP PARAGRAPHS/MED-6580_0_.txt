Abstract In our laboratories, for several years, two phenolic compounds have been detected during gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of urinary steroid extracts from human and animal species. Although features of the mass spectra of their trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives resembled those of oestrogens, they were atypical of steroids. The possibility that they were artefacts of the isolation procedures was discounted after careful studies with blanks, by varying the extraction method and because they were present almost exclusively as conjugates of glucuronic acid.
