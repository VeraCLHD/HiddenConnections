On day 1, 500-ml low- and high-fat meals were ingested and, on day 2, an 800-ml low-fat meal was ingested. The acid exposure time was assessed as the percentage of time with a pH < 4.0. The acid exposure time in subjects in the upright position was significantly longer in the 800-ml group than in the 500-ml group for the entire PP (2.7 +/- 1.5%; mean +/- SE, 0.7 +/- 0.4%; P < 0.05).
