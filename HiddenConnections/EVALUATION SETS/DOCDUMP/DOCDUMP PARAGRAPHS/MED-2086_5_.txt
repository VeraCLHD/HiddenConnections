RESULTS: Urinary sodium excretion was 155 ± 58 mmol/24 h US vs 113 ± 45 mmol/24 h RS (p = 0.002). Following the RS diet there was a significant improvement in FMD from 3.5 ± 2.8% to 5.6 ± 2.8% (P < 0.001) and decrease in serum endothelin-1 from 1.45 ± 0.38 pg/ml to 1.25 ± 0.39 pg/ml (P < 0.05). Endothelium-independent vasodilatation was also significantly different between treatments (P < 0.05).
