Abstract The incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and salivary immunoglobulin A concentrations [IgA(s)] of nine individuals were examined during 12 weeks of moderate exercise training, and compared to ten sedentary controls. Changes in maximal oxygen uptake were assessed at initial, mid-point and final evaluations (T1-3), while changes in [IgA(s)] and salivary immunoglobulin concentration-salivary albumin concentration ratio ([IgA(s)]:[Alb(s)]) were monitored at T1 and T3. During the 12 week period, symptoms of URTI were self-recorded daily.
