However, the use of platelet inhibitors for thrombosis prevention must seek a delicate balance between inhibiting platelet activation and an associated increased bleeding risk. The aim of this review is to up-date the knowledge on platelets physiology and dysfunction in pathologies, such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, emphasizing the link between platelets and the inflammation-related atherosclerosis. The review evaluates the opportunities offered by the novel platelet inhibitors to efficiently alleviate the thrombotic events.
