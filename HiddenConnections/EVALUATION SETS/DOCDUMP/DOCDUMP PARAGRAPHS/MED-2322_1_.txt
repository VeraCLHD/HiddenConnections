Cases were 44 women previously hospitalized at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, for severe hyperemesis gravidarum who delivered a singleton liveborn between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1995. Controls were 87 women who delivered a singleton liveborn at Brigham and Women's Hospital during the same period and who experienced less than 20 hours of nausea and fewer than three episodes of vomiting over the duration of their pregnancies. Odds ratios were derived from unconditional logistic regression models using data collected via self-administered food frequency questionnaires.
