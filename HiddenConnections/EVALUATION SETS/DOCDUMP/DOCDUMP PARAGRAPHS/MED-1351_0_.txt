Abstract Diet may represent a modifiable prostate cancer (CaP) risk factor, but a vegetable-based prostate-healthy diet is a major change for most men. We used a ratio of animal:vegetable proteins (A:V ratio) to evaluate whether a comprehensive dietary change was self-sustaining following completion of 11 weekly dietary and cooking classes that integrated mindfulness training (MT). Thirty-six men with recurring CaP were randomized to the intervention or wait-list control.
