Abstract AIMS: To investigate the association between resting heart rate (RHR) and markers of chronic low-grade inflammation. Also, to examine whether elevated resting heart rate is independently associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population, or whether elevated RHR is merely a marker of chronic low-grade inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A group of 6518 healthy subjects from the the Danish general population were followed for 18 years during which 1924 deaths occurred.
