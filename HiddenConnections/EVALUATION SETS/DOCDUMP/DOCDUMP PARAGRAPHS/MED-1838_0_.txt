Abstract In this study, physicians' loyalties toward patients and pharmaceutical companies in clinical drug research are explored, using Bourdieu's conceptual tools. The utilization of estrogen supplements in so-called hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for healthy menopausal and postmenopausal women is used as a case. For over 60 years a multitude of reports in medical journals have praised the benefits of HRT, even though some studies indicated hazards.
