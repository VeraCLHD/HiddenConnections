The degree of disk degeneration and the status of lumbar arteries were evaluated independently by two radiologists. ADC calculations were performed on the basis of the average signal intensities of the selected region of interest in lumbar disks. The association between ADC values of disks, the disk degeneration, and the status of lumbar arteries of the same level were analyzed with analysis of covariance, and pairwise analysis between groups (Scheff√© post hoc multiple comparison) was performed with statistical software.
