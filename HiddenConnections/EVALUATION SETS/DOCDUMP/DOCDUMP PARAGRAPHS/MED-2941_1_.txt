By isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting, three common alleles have been demonstrated in 365 unrelated Nigerian blacks. Furthermore, the APO E genetic polymorphism's effect on quantitative levels of lipids and lipoproteins has been determined. The respective frequencies of the APO E*2, APO E*3, and APO E*4 alleles are .027, .677, and .296.
