We found no association between LTL and body mass index, waist-hip ratio, smoking, physical activity or educational attainment. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of elderly men and women, there were only a few statistically significant effects of diet, but in general they support the hypothesis that fat and vegetable intakes were associated with LTL.
