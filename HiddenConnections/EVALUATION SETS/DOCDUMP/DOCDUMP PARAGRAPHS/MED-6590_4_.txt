The purpose of this review is to discuss factors that may contribute to these contradictory findings obtained in epidemiological studies, including age distribution, enterolactone measurement error, heterogeneity of breast cancer subtypes, and genetic factors. Different sources of enterolactone precursors may also contribute to inconclusive results. In conclusion, to get robust evidence of the health effects of lignans and enterolactone, more effort has to be put on methodological problems, including reducing measurement errors in enterolactone estimation, and to identify factors that modify the effect.
