However, little research has been done to address questions concerning the distribution of Pb in different varieties of tea plant and the differences among tea plant varieties in their uptake and accumulation of Pb from the soil. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the accumulation of Pb in different tea plant varieties and the factors affecting Pb bioavailability. RESULTS: Three patterns of Pb distribution could be observed in different plant parts among the eight tea varieties surveyed, as well as a linear relationship between the Pb concentration in fine roots and the exchangeable Pb fraction in the corresponding soil.
