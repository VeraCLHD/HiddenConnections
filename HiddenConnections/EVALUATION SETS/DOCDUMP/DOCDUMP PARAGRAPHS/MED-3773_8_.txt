The dose-response RR of CHD for an increase in heme iron intake of 1 mg/day was 1.27 (95% CI 1.10-1.47), with low heterogeneity (P (heterogeneity) = 0.25, I (2) = 25.8%). We observed no significant publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that heme iron intake was associated with an increased risk of CHD.
