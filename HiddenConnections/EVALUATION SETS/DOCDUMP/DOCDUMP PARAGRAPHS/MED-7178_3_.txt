Most people are probably exposed to a GBS trigger, but only rarely does the disease develop. We propose that GBS illustrates competing determinants of the immune system's decision about whether to mount a response, and that in unlucky affected individuals, co-presentation of cross-reactive antigens with danger signals activating pattern-recognition receptors overcomes normal self-recognition such that a primary response is initiated that attacks the nerve. Then, in most cases of GBS, the response rapidly turns off, and second attacks rarely occur.
