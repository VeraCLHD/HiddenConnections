There were significantly lower glucose and insulin peaks after ingestion of the FVPD compared with control (P= 0·019 and 0·003) and a trend towards increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation following FVPD consumption (P= 0·061). Overall, FVPD consumption significantly increased plasma vitamin C and total nitrate/nitrite concentrations, with a trend towards increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Puréed F&V products are useful vehicles for increasing micronutrient status, plasma antioxidant capacity and in vivo NO generation, which may contribute to CVD risk reduction.
