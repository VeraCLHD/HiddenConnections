In the first structured investigation of its kind, this study reports levels of these contaminants in commonly consumed offals (n=173) such as lamb, ox, deer and pig's liver, kidneys, tongue and heart, and offal products such as pâté, haggis, tripe and black pudding. The results support literature observations on the preferential accumulation of contaminants in liver tissue, as the highest concentrations of PCDD/Fs were observed in liver, relative to the other organs (e.g. 8.4 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) lamb liver compared to 1.1 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) lamb kidney and 1.27 ng WHO-TEQ kg(-1) lamb heart). Offal products generally showed lower contaminant levels which may be a result of processing or dilution.
