Odds ratios for a 1-SD increment of each lipoprotein variable were calculated with adjusted logistic regression models. Gemfibrozil treatment increased LDL size and lowered numbers of LDL particles (-5%) while raising numbers of HDL particles (10%) and small HDL subclass particles (21%). Concentrations of these LDL and HDL particles achieved with gemfibrozil were significant, independent predictors of new CHD events.
