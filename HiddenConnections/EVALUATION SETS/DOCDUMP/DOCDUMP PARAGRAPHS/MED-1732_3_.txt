STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they were parallel-group RCTs with a clearly identified primary outcome showing statistically nonsignificant results (ie, P > or = .05). DATA EXTRACTION: Two readers appraised each selected article using a pretested, standardized data abstraction form developed in a pilot test. RESULTS: From the 616 published reports of RCTs examined, 72 were eligible and appraised.
