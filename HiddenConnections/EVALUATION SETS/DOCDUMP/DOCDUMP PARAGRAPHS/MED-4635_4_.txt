Hazard ratios for NMR measures were comparable but not superior to standard lipids: total cholesterol 2.08 (1.63−2.67), LDL cholesterol 1.74 (1.40−2.16), HDL cholesterol 0.52 (0.42−0.64), triglycerides 2.58 (1.95−3.41), non-HDL cholesterol 2.52 (1.95−3.25), total/HDL cholesterol ratio 2.82 (2.23−3.58); and apolipoproteins: B100 2.57 (1.98−3.33), A-1 0.63 (0.52−0.77), B100/A-1 ratio 2.79 (2.21−3.54). There was essentially no reclassification improvement with adding LDLNMR particle concentration or apolipoprotein B100 to a model that already included the total/HDL cholesterol ratio and non-lipid risk factors (net reclassification index [NRI], 0% and 1.9%, respectively), nor did the addition of either variable result in a statistically significant improvement in the c-index. Conclusions In this prospective study of healthy women, CVD risk prediction associated with lipoprotein profiles evaluated by NMR was comparable but not superior to standard lipids or apolipoproteins.
