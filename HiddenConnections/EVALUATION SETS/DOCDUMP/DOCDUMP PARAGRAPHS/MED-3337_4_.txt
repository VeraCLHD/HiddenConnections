In addition their performance was compared to negative (Volvic(™) water) and positive (orange juice) control drinks as well as a homemade smoothie, based upon the recipe of one of the commercially bought drinks, from which ingredient omissions were made. RESULTS: The majority of the drinks investigated had a baseline pH below the critical pH of enamel (5.5) and required comparable volumes of 0.1M NaOH to raise their pH to neutrality as the positive control. Only two drinks (Volvic(™) still mineral water, the negative control, and the yoghurt, vanilla bean and honey 'thickie') displayed a higher pH, though to neutralise the thickie, a lesser quantity of alkali addition was required.
