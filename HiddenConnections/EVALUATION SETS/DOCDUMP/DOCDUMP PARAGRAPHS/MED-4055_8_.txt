Similarly, combinations of CPT-11 (48 mg/kg/injection, q3dx5, i.v.) with cetuximab (1 mg/mouse/injection, q3dx5, i.p.) failed to show any improvements over individual monotherapies in the cetuximab resistant/weakly responsive HT29, A549, and WiDr models. We conclude that preclinical activity associated with cetuximab monotherapy does not correlate directly with relative basal levels of total or activated (pY1068) EGFR in a tumor. Moreover, robust single-agent activity by cetuximab may be the best predictor for this agent to potentiate chemotherapy-mediated antitumor activities.
