Abstract The aim of the present in situ study was to evaluate the effect of different periods of intra-oral remineralisation on the susceptibility of softened dentin to toothbrushing abrasion. Groups of 6 human dentin specimens (A-F) were recessed in the buccal aspects of intra-oral appliances which were worn for 21 days by 11 volunteers. The samples were demineralised twice a day extra-orally in the acidic beverage Sprite Light (pH 2.9) for 90 s. Subsequently, the dentin specimens were brushed at different times.
