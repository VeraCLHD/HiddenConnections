Tandem mass spectrometric (MS) analysis was carried out to confirm the identification of BMAA in neurological specimens. RESULTS: We detected and quantified BMAA in neuroproteins from postmortem brain tissue of patients from the United States who died with sporadic AD and ALS but not HD. Incidental detections observed in two out of the 24 regions were analyzed from the controls.
