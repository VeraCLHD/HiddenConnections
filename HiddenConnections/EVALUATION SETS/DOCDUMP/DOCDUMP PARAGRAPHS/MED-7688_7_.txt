A total of 47 participants had small-bowel mucosal lesions compatible with celiac disease (Marsh III), and these served as disease controls. RESULTS: In the gluten-containing diet group (Marsh I-II) the small-bowel mucosal villous architecture deteriorated in all participants, and the symptoms and abnormal antibody titers persisted. In contrast, in the GFD group (Marsh I-II) the symptoms were alleviated, antibody titers decreased, and mucosal inflammation diminished equally to celiac controls (Marsh III).
