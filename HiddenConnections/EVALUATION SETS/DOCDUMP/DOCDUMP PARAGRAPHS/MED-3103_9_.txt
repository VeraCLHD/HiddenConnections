For every six women and for every three men with hip fracture one extra death occurred above that expected in the background population. CONCLUSION: Hip fracture is associated with reduced life expectancy, with men having a greater reduction than women, even after accounting for time-related changes in background mortality in the population. These data underscore that hip fracture is an independent clinical risk factor for mortality.
