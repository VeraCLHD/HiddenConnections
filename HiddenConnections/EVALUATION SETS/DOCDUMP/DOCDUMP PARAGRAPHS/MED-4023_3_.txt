To investigate possible environmental risks, a number of epidemiological studies of ALS have been conducted. Some of these studies employ spatial analysis techniques that examine for spatial clusters of ALS and can help guide further research into identifying environmental exposures. Despite identifying geographical disparities in the distribution of ALS cases, these studies have not provided any clear associations with environmental factors.
