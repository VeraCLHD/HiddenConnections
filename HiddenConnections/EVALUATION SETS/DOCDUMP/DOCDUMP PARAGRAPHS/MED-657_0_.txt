Abstract Natural killer (NK) cell activity and concentration of CD16+ cells (NK cells) and CD20+ cells (monocytes) in peripheral blood were measured in highly trained racing cyclists and in age- and sex-matched untrained controls. Median NK cell activity was 38.1% (range 20.0%-57.1%) in trained vs 30.3% (range 19.7%-43.1%) in untrained (P = 0.008). Median %CD16+ cells was 17% (range 7%-33%) in trained vs 11% (3%-29%) in untrained (P = 0.007).
