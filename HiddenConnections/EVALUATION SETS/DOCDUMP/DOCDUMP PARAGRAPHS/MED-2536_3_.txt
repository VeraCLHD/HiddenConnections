Studies that involved humans were prioritized, including routes and levels of exposure, developmental and early-life exposures, immunotoxicity, and the development of allergic disease. RESULTS: The general public and those with allergy are exposed to significant levels of phthalates via diet, pharmaceuticals, phthalate-containing products, and ambient indoor environment via air and dust. Intravenous exposures occur through medical equipment.
