Abstract The aim of previous research into the causes of allergic diseases, including asthma was mostly to identify potential risk factors in the environment. No major risk factors have been identified, however. Over the past 10 years, focus has, therefore, more been directed towards protective factors that could enhance the development of tolerance to allergens which were previously encountered early in life, but are now lost in modern affluent societies.
