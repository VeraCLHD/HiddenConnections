In vivo matrigel plug assay in mice showed significant decrease in size (up to 43%, P < 0.001), vascularization and hemoglobin content (up to 94%, P < 0.001) in the plugs from fisetin-treated, compared with control mice. Overall, these results suggest that fisetin inhibits various attributes of angiogenesis, which might contribute to its reported antitumor effects, and therefore, fisetin warrants further investigation for its angiopreventive potential toward cancer control.
