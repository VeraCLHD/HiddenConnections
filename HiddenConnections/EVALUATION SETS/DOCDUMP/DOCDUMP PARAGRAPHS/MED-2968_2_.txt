However, the route of administration results in major differences in ascorbate bioavailability. Tissue and plasma concentrations are tightly controlled in response to oral administration, but this can be bypassed by intravenous administration. These data provide a plausible scientific rationale for the absence of a response to orally administered ascorbate in the Mayo clinic trials and indicate the need to reassess ascorbate as a cancer therapeutic.
