(3) The myocardial quadrant on the polar display with the lowest average activity expressed as a percent of maximal activity was 0.81 +/- 0.18 after the initial control period, 0.87 +/- 0.014 after the treatment period, and 0.77 +/- 0.23 after the final control period with significant improvement occurring between the initial control and treatment periods (P = .05) and worsening occurring between the treatment and final control periods (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that relatively short-term, intensive cholesterol lowering over 90 days improves myocardial perfusion capacity before anatomic regression of stenoses occurs and that such improvement, or deterioration after withdrawal of lipid-lowering treatment, can be followed noninvasively by dipyridamole PET, reflecting the integrated flow capacity of the entire coronary arterial/arteriolar vascular system affected by diffuse atherosclerosis.
