Abstract BACKGROUND: Recently, some common foods in daily life have been found to have anti-allergic effects. We have reported that tomato extract (TE) could possibly inhibit histamine release and mouse ear-swelling responses. Moreover, it is reported that TE could relieve the symptoms for Japanese cedar pollinosis.
