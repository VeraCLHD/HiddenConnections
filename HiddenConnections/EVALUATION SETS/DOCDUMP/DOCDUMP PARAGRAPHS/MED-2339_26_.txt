The clinical activity index (CAI) at six months was significantly lower in the curcumin group compared to the placebo group (1.0 ± 2.0 versus 2.2 ± 2.3;MD −1.20, 95%CI −2.14 to −0.26). The endoscopic index (EI) at six months was significantly lower in the curcumin group than in the placebo group (0.8 ± 0.6 versus 1.6 ± 1.6; MD −0.80, 95% CI −1.33 to −0.27). Authors’ conclusions Curcumin may be a safe and effective therapy for maintenance of remission in quiescent UC when given as adjunctive therapy along with mesalamine or sulfasalazine.
