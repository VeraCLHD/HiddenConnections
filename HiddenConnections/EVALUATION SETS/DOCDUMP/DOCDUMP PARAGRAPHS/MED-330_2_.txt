The group was divided into diabetic patients (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM], n = 13), insulin-resistant persons (n = 29) and those with normal insulin, less than or equal to 10 microU/ml (n = 30). The normal groups had very small but statistically significant decreases in all of the risk factors. The patients with NIDDM had the greatest decreases.
