There was a statistically significant association between Hispanic ethnicity and lower CV mortality (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78; p<0.001), and lower all-cause mortality (0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82; p<0.001). A subanalysis including only studies that reported prevalence of CV risk factors found similar results. OR for CV mortality among Hispanics was 0.49; 95% CI 0.30-0.80; p-value <0.01; and OR for all-cause mortality was 0.66; 95% CI 0.43-1.02; p-value 0.06.
