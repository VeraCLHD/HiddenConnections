METHODS: A prospective cohort study involved postmenopausal women (n = 229) participating in the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial. Usual fiber intake was estimated at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and after 3.2 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SD) years to assess changes in mean minimum coronary artery diameter and mean percent stenosis.
