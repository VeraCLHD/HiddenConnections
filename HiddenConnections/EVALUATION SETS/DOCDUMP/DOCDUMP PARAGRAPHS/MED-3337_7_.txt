The immersion of the tooth samples in the drinks brought about reductions in their surface hardness (expressed as a percentage change of median hardness) but these were only significant (p <0.001) for the cranberry, blueberry and cherry fruit smoothie and homemade strawberry and banana fruit smoothie. There was no reduction in surface hardness in the case of the teeth immersed in the thickie. Omission of certain ingredients from the homemade smoothie affected the magnitude of surface hardness reductions seen.
