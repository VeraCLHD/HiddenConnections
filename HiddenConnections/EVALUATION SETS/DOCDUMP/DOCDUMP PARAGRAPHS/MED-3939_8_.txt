These results were consistent across other waves. Perceived poor mental health status and previous diagnosis of a mood disorder and anxiety disorder also demonstrated statistically significant inverse associations with FVI (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a potentially important role of a healthy diet in the prevention of depression and anxiety.
