The capillary-to-fiber ratio was significantly lower at T2 (1.39 vs. 1. 08; P = 0.043). Our observations suggest that a quantitative loss in muscle CSA is a major contributor to the decrease in muscle strength seen with advancing age and, together with muscle strength at T1, accounts for 90% of the variability in strength at T2.
