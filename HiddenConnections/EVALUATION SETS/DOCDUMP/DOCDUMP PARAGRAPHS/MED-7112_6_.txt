A total of 36 different products (mean 2.3 per employee) were recommended with considerable variability in product evidence and cost. The education of the employees varied from postgraduate education (n=3), to undergraduate degree (n=3), college level (n=5) in CAM, or no formal education in CAM (n=21). CONCLUSION: There was considerable heterogeneity in advice on natural food products provided by employees of natural food stores and, in general, these individuals had limited formal training in CAM.
