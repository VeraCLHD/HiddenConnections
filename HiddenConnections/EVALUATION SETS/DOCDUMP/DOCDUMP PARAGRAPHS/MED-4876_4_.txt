Since the discovery of mTOR, extensive studies have intricately detailed the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 is regulated. Somewhat paradoxically, amino acid induced mTORC1 activation—arguably the most essential stimulus leading to mTORC1 activation—is the least understood. Here we review the current knowledge of nutrient dependent regulation of mTORC1.
