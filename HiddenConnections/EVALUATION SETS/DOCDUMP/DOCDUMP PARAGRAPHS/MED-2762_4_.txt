Fructose is a powerful driver of ATP catabolism that, in turn, leads to the production of uric acid. The new epidemic of gout is likely secondary in significant part to the rise in fructose consumption, as well as to the increase in obesity, the endurance of other dietary and non-dietary gout risk factors such as consumption of meat and alcohol, the continued use of culprit medications and potentially to the under-recognition of the benefits of certain foods and drinks (such as dairy products and coffee). Though the exact reasons for the rise in gout are yet unproven, this reopens the opportunity for dietary control of hyperuricemia through restraints that curtail not only exogenous but also endogenous pathways of purine production.
