More recent studies have demonstrated the role of oxidized high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the progression of kidney disease. Elucidation of the role of lipid-lowering therapies and the concomitant improvement in tubulointerstitial and glomerular diseases is a further evidence of the role of lipids in renal injury. Synergistic effects of lipid-lowering drugs and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in renal protection have also been documented.
