Although features of the mass spectra of their trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives resembled those of oestrogens, they were atypical of steroids. The possibility that they were artefacts of the isolation procedures was discounted after careful studies with blanks, by varying the extraction method and because they were present almost exclusively as conjugates of glucuronic acid. Several of the general characteristics of the unknown compounds were reported after one (referred to as compound 180/442) was found to have a cyclic pattern of excretion during the menstrual cycle of an adult vervet monkey (Fig. 1).
