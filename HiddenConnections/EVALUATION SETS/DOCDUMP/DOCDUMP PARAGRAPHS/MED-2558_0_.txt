Abstract Objective To test whether risk of Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with consumption of nicotine-containing edibles from the same botanical family as tobacco, Solanaceae, including peppers, tomatoes and potatoes. Methods In a population-based study with 490 newly diagnosed idiopathic PD cases diagnosed during 1992–2008 at the University of Washington Neurology Clinic or Group Health Cooperative in western Washington State and 644 unrelated, neurologically normal controls, we examined whether PD was associated with self-reported typical frequency of consumption of peppers, tomatoes, tomato juice and potatoes during adulthood, while adjusting for consumption of other vegetables, age, sex, race/ethnicity, tobacco use and caffeine. Results PD was inversely associated with consumption of all edible Solanaceae combined (relative risk [RR]=0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–1.01 per time per day), but not consumption of all other vegetables combined (RR=1.00, 95% CI 0.92–1.10).
