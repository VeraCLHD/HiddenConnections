Abstract Bloating, abdominal distention, and flatulence represent very frequent complaints in functional disorders but their pathophysiology and treatment are largely unknown. Patients frequently associate these symptoms with excessive intestinal gas and the reduction of gas production may represent an effective strategy. The aim was to evaluate the effect of alpha-galactosidase administration, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled protocol, on intestinal gas production and gas-related symptoms after a challenge test meal in healthy volunteers.
