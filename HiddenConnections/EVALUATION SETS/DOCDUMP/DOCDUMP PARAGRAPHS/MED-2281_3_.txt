Analysis of 16S rRNA sequences in stool samples of six volunteers detected 320 phylotypes (defined at >98% identity) of which 26, including 19 cultured species, each accounted for >1% of sequences. Although samples clustered more strongly by individual than by diet, time courses obtained by targeted qPCR revealed that â€˜blooms' in specific bacterial groups occurred rapidly after a dietary change. These were rapidly reversed by the subsequent diet.
