At the end of study, serum triglyceride levels were significantly lower compared with baseline in the RSG group (-0.38 Â± 0.79 mmol/L, p = 0.018), but no significant changes were observed in the HSG or DCG groups. Conclusion Despite concerns that pistachio nut consumption may promote weight gain, the daily ingestion of either 42 g or 70 g of pistachios for 12 weeks did not lead to weight gain or an increase in waist-to-hip ratio in Chinese subjects with metabolic syndrome. In addition, pistachio consumption may improve the risk factor associated with the metabolic syndrome.
