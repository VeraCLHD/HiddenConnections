Copper and peroxides were correlated in the AD population (Pearson's r = 0.61, P < 0.001). After treatment with d-penicillamine, the extent of oxidative stress (P < 0.05) was decreased, but no difference was observed in the rate of cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Data from this pilot study suggest that copper could play a role in the production of peroxides in AD, and that d-penicillamine has an effect in reducing oxidative damage, however, results are still inconclusive in terms of drug efficacy on the clinical progression of AD.
