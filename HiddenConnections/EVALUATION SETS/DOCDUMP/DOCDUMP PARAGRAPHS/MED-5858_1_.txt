In mammals, the intestine has further evolved to harbor a vast load of commensal bacteria that have important functions for the host. Discrimination by the host defense system of nonself from self can prevent invasion of pathogens, but equivalent responses to dietary or colonizing bacteria can lead to devastating consequences for the organism. This dilemma imposed by the gut environment has probably contributed significantly to the evolutionary drive that has led to sophisticated mechanisms and diversification of the immune system to allow for protection while maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier.
