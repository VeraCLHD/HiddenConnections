Abstract OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to identify and determine the relative importance of dietary and environmental risk and risk reduction factors for prostate cancer mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicountry ecologic approach was used in multivariate regression analyses with prostate cancer mortality rates and dietary factors and solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. Prostate cancer mortality rates for 32 predominantly Caucasian countries for the late 1990s were obtained from the World Health Organization.
