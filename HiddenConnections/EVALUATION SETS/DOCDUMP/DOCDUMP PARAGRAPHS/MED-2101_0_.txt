Abstract BACKGROUND: Rampant production in skeletal abnormalities can lead to hyperoxidant stress though the production of "reactive oxygen species" (ROS) by osteoclasts, which assist in bone remodeling under physiological conditions. METHODS: Thirty cases each of post-menopausal osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy and bone fractures constituted the test groups. Thirty healthy subjects made up the control group.
