RESULTS: During a mean follow-up time of 10.3 years, 233 incident stroke cases were documented. Total and processed fruit and vegetable intake were not related to incident stroke. Total stroke incidence was 30% lower for participants with a high intake of raw fruit and vegetables (Q4: >262 g/day; HR: 0.70; 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs): 0.47-1.03) compared with those with a low intake (Q1: ≤92 g/day) and the trend was borderline significant (P for trend=0.07).
