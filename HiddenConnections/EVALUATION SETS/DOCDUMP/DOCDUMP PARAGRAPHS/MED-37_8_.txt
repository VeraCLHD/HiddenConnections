Total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly lower, and in vitro LDL oxidation lag phase was significantly longer on the tofu diet compared to the meat diet. The hemostatic factors, factor VII and fibrinogen, and lipoprotein(a) were not significantly affected by the tofu diet. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in LDL oxidation lag phase would be expected to be associated with a decrease in coronary heart disease risk.
