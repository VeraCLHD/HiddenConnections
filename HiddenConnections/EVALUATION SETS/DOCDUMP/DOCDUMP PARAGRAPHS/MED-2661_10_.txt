In seropositive patients, 52-week mean SELENA-SLEDAI scores were decreased by 28.8% with belimumab versus 14.2% with placebo (P < 0.05), and physician's global assessment scores were improved by 32.7% with belimumab versus 10.7% with placebo (P < 0.05). Two Phase III studies were performed in seropositive SLE patients. In a Phase III, 52-week study, the rates of response (a reduction of â‰¥4 points on the SLE Response Index [SRI]) at week 52 were 51% and 58% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose, respectively, versus 44% with placebo (both, P < 0.05).
