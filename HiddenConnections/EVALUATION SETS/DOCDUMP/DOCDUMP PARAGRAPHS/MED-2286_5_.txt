Microscopic counts of the bacteria in each fraction of the stool showed that the microbial fraction contained 95% of the total bacteria. Chemical analysis of the component sugars indicated 6-7% possible contamination by non-bacterial polysaccharides. The bacterial pellet was 6% nitrogen, and accounted for 60% of the total faecal nitrogen.
