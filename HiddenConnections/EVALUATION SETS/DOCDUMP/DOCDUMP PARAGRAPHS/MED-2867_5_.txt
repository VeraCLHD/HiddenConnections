Erythema was induced by illumination of dorsal skin (scapular region) with a solar simulator at the beginning of the study, after 4 wk and after 10 wk. Intensity of erythema was measured by chromatometry; the a-value was determined directly before and 24 h after irradiation. Serum carotenoid levels were measured by HPLC.
