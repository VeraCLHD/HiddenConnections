The tolerable upper intake level (TUIL), currently set at 2000IU (50microg)/day, is too low to permit optimization of Vitamin D status in the general population. Actual toxicity is not seen below serum 25OHD values of 250nmol/L, a value that would be produced only at continuing oral intakes in excess of 10,000IU (250microg)/day.
