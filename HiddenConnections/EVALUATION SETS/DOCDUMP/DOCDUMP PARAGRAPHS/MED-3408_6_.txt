generation from superoxide and hydrogen peroxide produced by bacterial metabolism. Such free radical generation in feces could provide a missing link in our understanding of the etiology of colon cancer: the oxidation of procarcinogens either by fecal HO., or by secondary peroxyl radicals (ROO.) to form active carcinogens or mitogenic tumor promotors.
