Abstract BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have shown inverse associations between nut consumption and diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality, but results have not been consistent. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relation between nut intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes, CVD, and all-cause mortality. DESIGN: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for all prospective cohort studies published up to March 2013 with RRs and 95% CIs for outcomes of interest.
