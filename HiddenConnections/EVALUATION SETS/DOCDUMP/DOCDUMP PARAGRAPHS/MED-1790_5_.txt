EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pure cultures of mammary epithelial cells were established from cells shed into the milk of 28 cows. BLV was searched in these cultures by immunocytochemistry and the polymerase chain reaction, the specificity of the latter confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and DNA sequencing. BLV was searched immunocytochemically in mammary tissue sections from 12 cows.
