In comparative studies in patients with functional dyspepsia, cisapride was at least as effective as metoclopramide, domperidone, clebopride, ranitidine and cimetidine. Cisapride increases stool frequency and reduces laxative consumption in patients with idiopathic constipation. Severe cases of slow transit constipation seem refractory to cisapride.
