HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that during cholesterol crystallization the spatial configuration rapidly changes, causing forceful expansion of sharp-edged crystals that can damage the plaque cap. METHODS: Two experiments were performed in vitro: first, cholesterol powder was melted in graduated cylinders and allowed to crystallize at room temperature. Volume changes from liquid to solid state were measured and timed.
