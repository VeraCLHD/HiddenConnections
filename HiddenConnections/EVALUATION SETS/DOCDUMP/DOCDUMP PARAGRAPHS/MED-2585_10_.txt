Secondary analysis failed to show any significant effect of LCPUFA dosing or prematurity status on supplementation efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: LCPUFA supplementation of infant formulas failed to show any significant effect on improving early infant cognition. Further research is needed to determine if LCPUFA supplementation of infant formula has benefits for later cognitive development or other measures of neurodevelopment.
