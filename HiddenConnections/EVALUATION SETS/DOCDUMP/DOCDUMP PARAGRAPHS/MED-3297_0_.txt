Abstract In the course of some 800 perinatal necropsies (corresponding to approximately 26,000 deliveries), 3 stillborn infants were found to have an almost completely closed ductus arteriosus. Each of these showed cardiomegaly, dilatation of right-side chambers, pulmonary hyperaemia and oedema of varying degree and extent; intrauterine death was considered to be due to P.C.D.A. In several further cases the ductus was also narrowed but not necessarily responsible for intrauterine death.
