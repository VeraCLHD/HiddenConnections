A secondary aim was to relate self-experienced adverse reactions to dairy produce and wheat to the local mucosal reactivity observed after rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) and wheat gluten. METHODS: A questionnaire about self-experienced adverse reaction to food was sent to 347 RA patients. Rectal challenge with CM and gluten was performed in 27 of these patients and in healthy controls (n = 18).
