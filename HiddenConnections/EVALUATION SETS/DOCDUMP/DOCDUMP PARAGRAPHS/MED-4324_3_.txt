METHOD: Review of Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from 1975 to 2012 using MeSH headings 'crohn's disease' 'ulcerative colitis' 'enteral' 'diet' 'nutrition' 'fatty acid' and 'food additives'. RESULTS: Enteral nutrition with a formula-defined feed is effective treatment for CD, but approximately 50% of patients relapse within 6 months of return to normal diet. There is no direct evidence of benefit from any other specific dietary modification in CD, but indirect evidence supports recommendation of a low intake of animal fat, insoluble fibre and processed fatty foods containing emulsifiers.
