Studying cellular repair of strand breaks is complicated by the fact that lymphocytes appear to repair them very slowly. Applying the in vitro repair assay to human lymphocytes has revealed stimulatory effects on repair of oxidised bases by various micronutrients or a fruit- and vegetable-rich diet, while other studies have failed to demonstrate effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite varied results from different studies, it seems clear that micronutrients can influence DNA repair, usually but not always enhancing activity.
