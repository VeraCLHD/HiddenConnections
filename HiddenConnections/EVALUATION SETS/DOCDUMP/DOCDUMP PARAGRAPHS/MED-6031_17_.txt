17 patients required immunomodulatory therapies, six improved spontaneously, and one was lost to follow-up after exposure stopped. INTERPRETATION: The neurological disorder described is autoimmune in origin and is related to occupational exposure to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigens. The pattern of nerve involvement suggests vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the blood-nerve barrier is most permeable.
