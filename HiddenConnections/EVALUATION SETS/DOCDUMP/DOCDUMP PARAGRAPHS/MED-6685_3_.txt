Results showed that Ac and Gp (5-20 mg gallic acid equivalent/L) protected HUVEC against glucose-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Glucose-induced expression of interleukin-6 and -8 was down-regulated by Ac and Gp at mRNA and protein levels. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/L)-induced inflammation, Ac and Gp inhibited gene expression of adhesion molecules and NF-κB activation to similar extents, although Gp was more effective in decreasing PECAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein.
