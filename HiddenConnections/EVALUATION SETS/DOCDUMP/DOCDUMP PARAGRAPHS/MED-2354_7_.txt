RESULTS: MedDietScore was negatively correlated to patients' serum alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.03) and insulin levels (p = 0.001), insulin resistance index (p = 0.005) and severity of steatosis (p = 0.006) and positively to serum adiponectin levels (p = 0.04). Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) exhibited lower adherence to MD (29.3 ± 3.2 vs. 34.1 ± 4.4, p = 0.004) compared to those with simple fatty liver. Logistic regression analysis revealed that one unit increase in the MedDietScore was associated with 36% lower likelihood of having NASH (odds ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.92), after adjusting for sex and abdominal fat level.
