Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) remains high and the complications of infection are common. Our goal was to project the future prevalence of CH-C and its complications. METHODS: We developed a multicohort natural history model to overcome limitations of previous models for predicting disease outcomes and benefits of therapy.
