Lubiprostone was safe with insignificant harm in one combined phase III trial. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors did not have enough data for a reliable meta-analysis of harm but seemed to be safe. More rigorous data were available for tricyclic antidepressants, alosetron, and rifaximin; the numbers needed to harm were 18.3, 19.4, and 8971, respectively, and the numbers needed to treat were 8, 7.5, and 10.6, respectively.
