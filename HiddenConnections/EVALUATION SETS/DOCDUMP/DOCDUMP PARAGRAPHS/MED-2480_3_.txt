After 2 h of infusion of Intralipid plus heparin, FFA levels increased from 562+/-95 to 1,303+/-188 micromol, and from 350+/-35 to 3,850+/-371 micromol (P < 0.001) vs. saline for both low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Mch-induced vasodilation relative to baseline was reduced by approximately 20% in response to the raised FFA levels in both groups (P < 0.05, saline vs. FFA, ANOVA). In contrast, similar FFA elevation did not change leg blood flow responses to sodium nitroprusside.
