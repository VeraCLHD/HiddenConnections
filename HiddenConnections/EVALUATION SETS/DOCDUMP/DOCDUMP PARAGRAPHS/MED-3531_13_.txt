Standardized uptake values (SUV(L MAX), 3.1; SUV(L MEAN), 2.1) were significantly lower in group B than in the 2 other groups (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: So-called muscle uptake in the supraclavicular region may be caused in a significant proportion of cases by an unrelated process we call the USA-fat finding, with (18)F-FDG uptake in tissues of low-Hounsfield (fat) density. This finding most likely reflects an underlying nonpathologic process that we hypothesize to be in foci of brown fat.
