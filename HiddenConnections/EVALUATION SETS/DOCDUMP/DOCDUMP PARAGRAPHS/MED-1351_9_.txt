Participants reported regular MT practice and there was a significant correlation between MT practice and changes in both initiation and maintenance of the change in the A:V ratio. These pilot results provide encouraging evidence for the feasibility of a dietary program that includes MT in supporting dietary change for men with recurrent CaP and invite further study to explore the possible role of MT as a means of supporting both initiation of dietary changes and maintenance of those changes over time.
