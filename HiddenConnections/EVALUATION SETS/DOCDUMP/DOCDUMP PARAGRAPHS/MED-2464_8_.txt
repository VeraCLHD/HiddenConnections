The annual increase of IMT(mean) was reduced by approximately 50% in the acarbose group versus placebo. Multiple linear regression revealed IMT progression as significantly related to acarbose intake. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose slows progression of IMT in IGT subjects, a high-risk population for diabetes and atherosclerosis.
