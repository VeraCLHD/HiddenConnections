METHODS: A multicenter cooperative study, Pathobiological Determinants of Atheroscle-rosis in Youth (PDAY), was organized in 1985 to examine the relationship of the risk factors for adult CHD to preclinical atherosclerotic lesions in youth. Fourteen participating centers collected arteries, blood, other tissue, and data from 3,000 persons 15-34 years of age who died from external causes and were autopsied in forensic laboratories. Central laboratories evaluated atherosclerosis in the aorta and coronary arteries, measured lipoproteins and thio-cyanate (for smoking) in serum, glycohemo-globin in red blood cells (for blood glucose), thickness of small renal arteries (for hypertension), and body mass index (for obesity).
