The urinary calcium excretion with cheese was 141% (P = 0.001), with milk was 107% (P = 0.004), and with calcium salt was 75% (P = 0.02) above that of the control session. Our results show that calcium from sesame seeds and spinach does not cause an acute response in calcium metabolism. Our results indicate that fermented cheese could be a better dietary source of calcium than milk when the metabolic effects of the foodstuffs are considered.
