Abstract Aging and metabolism-related disorders are risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD). Since sirtuins may increase the lifespan through regulation of cellular metabolism, we compared the concentration of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the brains of AD patients (n = 19) and controls (n = 22) using Western immunoblots and in situ hybridization. We report a significant reduction of SIRT1 (mRNA: −29%; protein: −45%) in the parietal cortex of AD patients, but not in the cerebellum.
