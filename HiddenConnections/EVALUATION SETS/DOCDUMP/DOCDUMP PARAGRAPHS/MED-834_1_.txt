Although the literature on gastrointestinal (GI) safety of NSAID therapy is extensive, the risk profiles of OTC and prescription dosing are seldom separated, and few studies provide risks specific to OTC ibuprofen. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a literature review to evaluate the risk of GI bleeding events related to OTC ibuprofen use. METHODS: Published clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses of OTC ibuprofen use, defined as up to 1200â€‰mg/day or stated as 'over the counter,' reporting endpoints of incidence rates and proportions of GI bleeding events (e.g., GI bleeding-related hospitalizations and deaths) were identified via MEDLINE through 2010.
