It is therefore critical to distinguish the variety of cofactors involved in NNK-mediated pathogenesis, and the unique pathways necessary for successful cellular biotransformation. Current reviews have consistently identified the strengths of NNK and prospective tumor capabilities. Others have delineated specific cellular factors mediating NNK and lung tumors, and have identified metabolic and signaling pathways largely responsible for NNK activation and tumorigenic initiation.
