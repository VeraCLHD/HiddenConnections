Women in the top quartile of the DASH score had decreased risk for rapid eGFR decline (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80), but had no association with microalbuminuria. These associations did not vary with diabetes status. The prudent dietary pattern was not associated with microalbuminuria or eGFR decline.
