Methylmercury and β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) have both been implicated in this role. Exposure of primary cortical cultures to these compounds independently induced concentration-dependent neurotoxicity. Importantly, concentrations of BMAA (10-100 μM) that caused no toxicity alone potentiated methylmercury (3 μM) toxicity.
