Blood and urine samples were collected at the beginning and end of each period. Data were analyzed by multiple linear regression for a repeated-measure design. ISP consumption led to changes of -9.5% in urinary albumin excretion (P < 0.0001), -0.45 in the total-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio (P < 0.05), -0.20 in the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (P < 0.05), and +4.3% in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.0040).
