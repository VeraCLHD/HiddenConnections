Serum 25OHD levels were low at baseline (median, 32.9 nmol/L) and increased only slightly depending on the number of sunlight sessions attended over 12 months (P = 0.04). During the study, 327 falls occurred in 111 (54%) subjects in the control group, 326 falls in 111 (58%) subjects in the UV only group and 335 falls in 108 (52%) subjects in the UV+ group. By intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant effect of increased UV exposure on falls risk (IRR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.76-1.48; P = 0.73).
