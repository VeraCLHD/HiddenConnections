We analyzed serum glucose and lipid variables and serum IL-8, IL-18, and adiponectin concentrations at baseline and at 2 and 4 h after ingestion of the meals. RESULTS: Compared with nondiabetic subjects, diabetic patients had higher fasting IL-8 (P < 0.05) and IL-18 (P < 0.01) concentrations and lower adiponectin concentrations (P < 0.01) at baseline. In both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, IL-18 concentrations increased and adiponectin concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) from baseline concentrations after consumption of the high-fat meal.
