Blending of cooked beans made no difference to plasma glucose, insulin, or GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide) responses in nondiabetics, NIDD (noninsulin-dependent diabetics), and IDD (insulin-dependent diabetics). The cooked blended beans gave a greater plasma glucose response and a lesser hormonal response than a cooked flummery (containing cornstarch, protein and fat) in nondiabetics. In NIDD and IDD, however, the reverse applied for plasma glucose.
