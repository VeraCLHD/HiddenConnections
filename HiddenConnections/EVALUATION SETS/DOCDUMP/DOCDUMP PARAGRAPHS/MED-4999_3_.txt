For each subpopulation, we modeled log urinary Cd using variable-threshold censored multiple regression. Models included individual-level covariates (age, gender, BMI, income, race/ethnicity/country of origin, education, survey period), smoking, housing (home age, water source, filter use), and diet (supplement use; 24-h calorie, fat, protein, micronutrient, and Cd-containing food intakes), creatinine, and survey year variables. Geometric mean urinary Cd (ng/mL) declined 20-25% in these subpopulations, and the regressions showed statistically significant declines in later years for teens and adults.
