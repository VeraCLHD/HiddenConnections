A 10-nmol/L increment in circulating 25(OH)D levels conferred a hazard ratio of 0.96 (95% CI = 0.95-0.97) for overall survival of the cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that cancer patients with higher circulating 25(OH)D levels at or near the time of diagnosis have better outcomes.
