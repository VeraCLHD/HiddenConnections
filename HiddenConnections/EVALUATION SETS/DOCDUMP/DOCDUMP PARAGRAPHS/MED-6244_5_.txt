The decrease reached about 60% at the end of treatment in the red pepper group, whilst placebo scores decreased by less than 30%. CONCLUSIONS: : Red pepper was more effective than placebo in decreasing the intensity of dyspeptic symptoms, probably through a desensitization of gastric nociceptive C-fibres induced by its content of capsaicin. It could represent a potential therapy for functional dyspepsia.
