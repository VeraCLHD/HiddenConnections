FMD was significantly more impaired after the HSM than after the LSM at 30 min [HSM (mean ± SD): 3.39 ± 2.44%; LSM: 6.05 ± 3.21%; P < 0.01] and at 60 min (HSM: 2.20 ± 2.77%; LSM: 4.64 ± 2.48%; P < 0.01). No significant differences in BP or RHI were observed between meals. CONCLUSIONS: An HSM, which reflects the typical amount of salt consumed in a commonly eaten meal, can significantly suppress brachial artery FMD within 30 min.
