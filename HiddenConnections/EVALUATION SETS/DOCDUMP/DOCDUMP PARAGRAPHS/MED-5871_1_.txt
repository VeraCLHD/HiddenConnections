Two groups of subjects were studied--one group habitually consumed legume seeds as part of their normal diet, a second group only infrequently consumed legumes. No differences between these groups could be detected for fecal output and frequency, intestinal transit time, VFA excretion or fecal pH during 23-day study periods in which subjects consumed either their usual diet or 100 g red kidney beans, daily. However, the addition of beans to the diets of both groups provided significantly more dietary fiber, and produced greater fecal output and a higher concentration of VFA in feces.
