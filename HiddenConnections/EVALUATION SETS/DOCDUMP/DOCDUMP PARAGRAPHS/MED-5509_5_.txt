Randomized controlled primary or secondary prevention trials were considered for inclusion. Eligible trials investigated daily multivitamin-multimineral supplementation for â‰¥1 y. Cohorts described as institutionalized or as having terminal illness (tertiary prevention) were excluded. The number of deaths and the sample size of each study arm were extracted independently by 2 researchers.
