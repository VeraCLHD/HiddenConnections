From 2001 to 2004, incidence declined by 8.8% in the counties with the smallest EPHT reductions, by 13.9% in those with intermediate reductions, and by 22.6% in counties with the largest EPHT reductions. Between 2001 and 2003, CHIS data did not show any significant change in the proportion of women who reported having a mammogram in the previous 2 years. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that changes in EPHT use in 2002 may be responsible for significant declines in breast cancer incidence between 2002 and 2003 and sustained through 2004.
