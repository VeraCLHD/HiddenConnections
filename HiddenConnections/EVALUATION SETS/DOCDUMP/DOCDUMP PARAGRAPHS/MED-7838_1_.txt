In the present study, an anthocyanin-rich extract from Concord grapes [referred to as Concord grape extract (CGE)] and the anthocyanin delphinidin were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit DNA adduct formation due to the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in MCF-10F cells, a noncancerous, immortalized human breast epithelial cell line. CGE at 10 and 20 microg/mL and delphinidin at 0.6 microM concentrations significantly inhibited BP-DNA adduct formation. This was associated with a significant increase in activities of the phase II detoxification enzymes glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H:quinone reductase 1.
