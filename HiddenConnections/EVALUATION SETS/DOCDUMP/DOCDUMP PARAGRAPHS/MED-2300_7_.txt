Glucose loading did not change nitrite/nitrate concentration in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in response to oral glucose loading rapidly suppresses endothelium-dependent vasodilation, probably through increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals. These findings strongly suggest that prolonged and repeated post-prandial hyperglycemia may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
