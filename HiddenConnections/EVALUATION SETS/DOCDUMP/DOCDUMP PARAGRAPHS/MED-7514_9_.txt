The difference in daily AA secretion between the lowest and highest quartile of FM was comparable to that between the lowest and highest estimated activity of one of the major steroidogenic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Body fat mass may relevantly influence prepubertal adrenarchal androgen status. In addition, animal protein intake may also make a small contribution to AA secretion in children.
