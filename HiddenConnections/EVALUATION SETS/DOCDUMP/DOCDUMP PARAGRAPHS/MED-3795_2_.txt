This is rarely indicated or achieved in humans, but investigators have tried to decrease the numbers of organisms on the outside of patients (both environmental and on the skin) and to do the same with the inside--or at least to selectively decrease the organisms most likely to invade from mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal tract. Most studies of protected environments have included patients who receive prophylactic oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, prophylactic systemic antibiotics, or oral absorbable antibiotics (selective decontamination). Another variable that needs to be considered is the use of sterile food--included in some studies, not used in others, and not mentioned in still others.
