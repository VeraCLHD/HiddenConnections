Abstract Reactive oxygen species produced during vigorous exercise may permeate into cell nuclei and induce oxidative DNA damage, but the supporting evidence is still lacking. By using a 42 km marathon race as a model of massive aerobic exercise, we demonstrated a significant degree of unrepaired DNA base oxidation in peripheral immunocompetent cells, despite a concurrent increase in the urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Single cell gel electrophoresis with the incorporation of lesion-specific endonucleases further revealed that oxidized pyrimidines (endonuclease III-sensitive sites) contributed to most of the postexercise nucleotide oxidation.
