We hypothesized that individuals classified as DE have higher plasma osmolality (Posm), indicating suboptimal hydration, compared with those classified as non-DE. METHODS: Using a hospital-based observational cross-sectional design, assessment of DE and hydration was performed upon admission in 111 participants (N = 56 males and 55 females; mean ± SD age 77 ± 8 years). Assessments of DE included tear osmolarity (Tosm), the 5-item dry eye questionnaire (DEQ-5), rating of eye dryness using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and noninvasive tear film breakup time (NITBUT).
