The DL Mix2 modulated actin-related, cell-cell and epithelial-mesenchymal communication morphogenetic processes; Mix1 modulated smooth muscle function genes, whereas Mix3 mainly modulated genes involved in cell metabolism (e.g., steroid and lipid synthesis) and growth. Our data indicate that fetal exposure to environmentally relevant PCB levels modulates several patterns of genitourinary programming; moreover, NDL congener groups may have specific modes of action.
