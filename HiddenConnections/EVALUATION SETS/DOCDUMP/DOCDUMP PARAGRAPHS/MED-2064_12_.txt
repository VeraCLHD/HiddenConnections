Conflicting results led to a pilot test on the in vivo conversion (demethylation) of IX into 8-PN in two men. Conversion rates of 1.9 and 4.4% were estimated. Thus, the total 8-PN dose in beer brands spiced with natural hop or hop products seems to be the sum of the 8-PN amount in a consumed volume and the amount arising from the conversion of IX.
