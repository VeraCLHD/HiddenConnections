20 patients receiving cyclosporin reported adverse events compared with 8 taking placebo, although no patient required withdrawal from the study. Cyclosporin therapy led to an increase in the mean serum urea, creatinine, and bilirubin concentrations, although only the rise in bilirubin was significant (p = 0.001). Our results confirm that cyclosporin is a safe and effective short-term treatment for severe, refractory atopic dermatitis.
