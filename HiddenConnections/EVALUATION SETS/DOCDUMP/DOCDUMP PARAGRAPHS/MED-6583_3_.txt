The same, or a similar, substance seems to be excreted in the vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus). We now report the excretory pattern of X in more detail, the isolation of the pure compound from pooled pregnancy urine and the chemical structure. The structure determined by mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy and NMR spectrometry is: trans-(+/-)-3,4-bis[(3-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]dihydro-2-(3H)-furanone (HPMF) and was confirmed by synthesis.
