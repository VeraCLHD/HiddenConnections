Recent studies indicate that a subgroup of sporadic breast cancer might also be associated with reduction in BRCA1 mRNA levels and protein expression. However, the mechanism of reduced mRNA and protein expression is yet not fully elucidated. This study aims to assess BRCA1 protein expression and the role of BRCA1 promoter methylation in sporadic breast cancer in North Indian population and to correlate these with known prognostic factors and molecular profiles of breast cancer.
