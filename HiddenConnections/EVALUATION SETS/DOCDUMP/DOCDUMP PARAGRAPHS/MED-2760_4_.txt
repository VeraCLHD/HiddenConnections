The primary end point was change in the frequency of gout flares using a daily flare diary measured monthly for 3 months. RESULTS: The frequency of gout flares reduced in all three groups over the 3-month study period compared with baseline. Over the 3-month study period there was a significantly greater reduction in gout flares in the SMP/GMP/G600 group (analysis of covariance p(group)=0.031, Tukey post hoc test compared with lactose control, p=0.044).
