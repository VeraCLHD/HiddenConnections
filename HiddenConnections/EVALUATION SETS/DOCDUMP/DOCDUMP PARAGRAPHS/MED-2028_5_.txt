Twelve of the studies stratified the analysis by gender, and one study stratified people by place of birth (e.g. U.S.-born, Mexican-born, and Central/South American-born). There was a statistically significant association between Hispanic ethnicity and lower CV mortality (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78; p<0.001), and lower all-cause mortality (0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82; p<0.001). A subanalysis including only studies that reported prevalence of CV risk factors found similar results.
