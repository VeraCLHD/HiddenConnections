The correlation between disk degeneration and diffusion was not significant. Eight severely degenerated disks with normal lumbar artery status and diffusion values were found. CONCLUSION: Impaired flow in lumbar arteries is significantly associated with decreased diffusion in lumbar disks and may play an important role in disk degeneration.
