Abstract BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber and the resultant increase in colonic butyrate levels protect against colon carcinogenesis. Previous studies have shown that p21 and histone hyperacetylation are important in basal growth inhibition by butyrate. This study was designed to elucidate other mechanism underlying the butyrate effects on cell growth.
