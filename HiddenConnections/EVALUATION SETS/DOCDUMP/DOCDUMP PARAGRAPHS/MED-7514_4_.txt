Associations of the sum of C19 metabolites (reflecting daily AA secretion) with nutritional factors [fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), nutrient intakes, glycemic index, and glycemic load] and AA-relevant estimates of steroidogenic enzyme were examined in stepwise multiple regression models adjusted for age, sex, urine volume, and total energy intake. Enzyme activity estimates were calculated by using specific urinary steroid metabolite ratios. RESULTS: Of the nutrition-relevant predictors, FM (P < 0.0001) explained most of the variation of AA secretion (R(2) = 5%).
