Abstract The use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumours is increasing. However, the tolerability profile for EGFR-inhibitors, such as the monoclonal antibody cetuximab and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, is characterised by a unique group of skin reactions dominated by an acneiform eruption, xerosis, eczema and changes in the hair and nails. The possibility that this skin toxicity correlates with anti-tumour activity offers the potential to titrate dosing on a case-by-case basis.
