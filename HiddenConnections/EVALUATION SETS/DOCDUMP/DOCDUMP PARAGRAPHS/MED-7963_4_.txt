Odds ratios comparing highest versus lowest quintiles of intake were elevated for intake of animal protein (Odds ratio (OR) 5 2.0, 95% confidential interval: 1.5–2.7) and fat (OR 5 1.5, 1.2–2.0), but reduced for plant sources of these nutrients (OR 5 0.7, 0.5–0.9 for protein and OR 5 0.6, 0.5–0.8 for fat). Further analysis showed that saturated and monounsaturated fat intake was associated with elevated risk, while polyunsaturated fat intake was unrelated to risk. Dietary retinol, β-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, fiber, and vitamin supplements were inversely associated with risk.
