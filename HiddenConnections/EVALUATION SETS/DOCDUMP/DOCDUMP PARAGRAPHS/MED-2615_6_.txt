For the group as a whole, averaged importance scores were: discharge residence 31.3%, length of life 27%, fall risk 26.4% and family preference 15.5%. On average, subjects would be willing to sacrifice approximately 9 months of life in order to return home rather than go to a nursing home. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, older people at high risk for fracture judged that after a bad hip fracture their main priority would be to remain at home.
