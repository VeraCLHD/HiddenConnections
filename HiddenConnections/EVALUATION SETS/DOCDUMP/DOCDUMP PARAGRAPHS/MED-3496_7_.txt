The impairment of flow-mediated dilatation was more severe in CAD patients (44.41%) than in control participants (25.99%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Postprandial endothelium-dependent vasodilatation after a single high-fat meal was severely impaired in normocholesterolemic CAD patients and control participants. The disordered postprandial metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may play an atherogenic role by inducing endothelial dysfunction.
