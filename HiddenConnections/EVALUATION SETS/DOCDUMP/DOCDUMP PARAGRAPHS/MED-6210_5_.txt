Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissue.
