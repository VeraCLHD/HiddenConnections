Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United States. While the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines define NAFLD as hepatic steatosis detected either on histology or imaging without a secondary cause of abnormal hepatic fat accumulation, no imaging modality is recommended as standard of care for screening or diagnosis. Bedside ultrasound has been evaluated as a non-invasive method of diagnosing NAFLD with the presence of characteristic sonographic findings.
