We contacted the authors of eligible trials to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data, and to identify unpublished trials. We included any study in which investigators randomized hypertensive or normotensive people to calcium supplementation or alternative therapy and measured blood pressure for at least 2 weeks. In addition to 32 trials included in the prior metaanalysis, 10 new trials contributed to this metaanalysis.
