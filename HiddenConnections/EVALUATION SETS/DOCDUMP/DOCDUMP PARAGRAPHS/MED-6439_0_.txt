Abstract Autoimmune diseases are complex diseases resulting of the interaction between both genetics and environmental factors over time. Different phases in the development of autoimmune diseases are characterized by the detection of serum autoantibodies several months or years before the onset of clinical manifestations and subsequent diagnosis. In addition to serum antibodies, genetic susceptibility factors may predict the future development of the disease.
