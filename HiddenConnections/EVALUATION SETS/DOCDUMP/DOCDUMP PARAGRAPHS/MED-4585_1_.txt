We longitudinally evaluated changes in MnSOD activity and other indices of manganese and iron status in 47 women during a 124-d supplementation study. Subjects received one of four treatments: placebo, 60 mg iron, 15 mg manganese, or both mineral supplements daily. Manganese supplementation resulted in significant increases in lymphocyte MnSOD activity and serum manganese concentrations from baseline values but no changes in urinary manganese excretion or in any indices of iron status.
