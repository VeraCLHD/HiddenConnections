High ingestion of nonvolatile acids with food increases susceptibility for progression to end-stage renal failure. These high dietary acid loads lead to compensatory increases in renal acid excretion and ammoniagenesis. The price paid for maintenance of acid-base homeostasis is renal tubulointerstitial injury, with subsequent decline in renal function and induction of hypertension.
