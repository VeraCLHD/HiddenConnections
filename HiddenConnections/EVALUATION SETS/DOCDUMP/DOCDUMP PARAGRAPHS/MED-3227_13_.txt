Conclusions and Relevance Elevated cerebral Aβ was associated with cholesterol fractions in a pattern analogous to that found in coronary artery disease. This finding, in living, non-demented humans, is consistent with prior autopsy reports, with epidemiological findings, and with both animal and in vitro work suggesting an important role for cholesterol in Aβ processing. Because cholesterol levels are modifiable, understanding their link to amyloid deposition could potentially and eventually have impact in retarding the pathological cascade of AD.
