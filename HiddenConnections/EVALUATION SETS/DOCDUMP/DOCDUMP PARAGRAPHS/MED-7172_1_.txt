AIM: In this study, we assessed the domains of sexual function in a representative sample of sexually active premenopausal women with hyperlipidemia, but without cardiovascular disease, as compared with an age-matched female population without hyperlipidemia. METHODS: To be enrolled in the study, women had to meet at least one of the following criteria for the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels >160 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels <50 mg/dL; or triglyceride levels >150 mg/dL. Lipid parameters were assessed and verified on blood taken at least twice in the hospital during the screening phase.
