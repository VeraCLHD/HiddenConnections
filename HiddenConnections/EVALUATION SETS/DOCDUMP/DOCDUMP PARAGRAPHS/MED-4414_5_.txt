Contrast MRI studies have also made it possible to identify endplate breaks in vivo. In the future this technique may be applied to study the influence of smoking, mechanical loading of the discs, abnormal posture, and atherosclerosis of the lumbar arteries on diffusion. These conditions have all been implicated in disc degeneration through a final common pathway of altered diffusion and decreased nutrition.
