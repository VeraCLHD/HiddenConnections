MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed plasma concentrations of betaine, choline, cysteine, methionine, methylmalonic acid (MMA), vitamin B2, and vitamin B6 in 561 cases and 1,034 controls matched for age and recruitment date, nested within the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort. Relative risks of prostate cancer were estimated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Positive associations with prostate cancer risk were observed for choline and vitamin B2, and an inverse association was observed for MMA.
