Apple juice concentrate (AJC; 70 degree brix) was diluted into culture medium of SH-SY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells that had been differentiated for 7 days with 5 microM retinoic acid concurrent with the addition of 20 microM Abeta. AJC prevented the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) normally induced by Abeta treatment under these conditions. AJC also prevented Abeta-induced calcium influx and apoptosis, each of which results in part due to increased ROS.
