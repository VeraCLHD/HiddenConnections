OA used to be considered the sole consequence of any process leading to increased pressure on one particular joint or fragility of cartilage matrix.

The discovery that many soluble mediators such as cytokines or prostaglandins can increase the production of matrix metalloproteinases by chondrocytes led to the first steps of an "inflammatory" theory.
