Abstract BACKGROUND: High exposure to phthalates, which are ubiquitous contaminants, has been shown in animal studies to produce detrimental effects on male reproductive functions. A recent study in humans reported dose-response relations between low phthalate levels in urine and human semen parameters, which raises the question whether humans are more sensitive to phthalate exposure than animals. METHODS: Urine, serum, and semen samples were collected from 234 young Swedish men at the time of their medical conscript examination.
