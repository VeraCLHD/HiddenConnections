We studied 17 healthy young adults (28.9+/-3.0 years old; nine men), who were regular non-heavy coffee drinkers. The endothelial performance was estimated by endothelium-dependent FMD (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingestion of a cup of caffeinated coffee (80 mg of caffeine) or the corresponding decaffeinated beverage (< 2 mg of caffeine) in two separate sessions, following a randomized single-blind cross-over design. There was no difference in baseline FMD values between the two sessions [7.78 compared with 7.07% after caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee respectively; P = NS (not significant)].
