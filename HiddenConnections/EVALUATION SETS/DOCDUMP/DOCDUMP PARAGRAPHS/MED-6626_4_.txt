Plasma glucose and R then fell gradually to 3.9 +/- 0.3 mM and 0.81 +/- 0.01, respectively, after carbohydrate ingestion but were maintained at 5.1 +/- 0.1 mM and 0.83 +/- 0.01, respectively, by glucose infusion. Time to fatigue during this second exercise bout was significantly longer during the carbohydrate ingestion (26 +/- 4 min; P less than 0.05) or glucose infusion (43 +/- 5 min; P less than 0.01) trials compared with the placebo trial (10 +/- 1 min). Plasma insulin (approximately 10 microU/ml) and vastus lateralis muscle glycogen (approximately 40 mmol glucosyl U/kg) did not change during glucose infusion, with three-fourths of total carbohydrate oxidation during the second exercise bout accounted for by the euglycemic glucose infusion rate (1.13 +/- 0.08 g/min).
