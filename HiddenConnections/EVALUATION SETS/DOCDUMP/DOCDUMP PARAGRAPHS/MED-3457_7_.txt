In conclusion, (i) the renal excretion of orally absorbed AGEs is markedly suppressed in diabetic nephropathy patients, (ii) daily influx of dietary AGEs includes glycotoxins that may constitute an added chronic risk for renal-vascular injury in DM, and (iii) dietary restriction of AGE food intake may greatly reduce the burden of AGEs in diabetic patients and possibly improve prognosis.
