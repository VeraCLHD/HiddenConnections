To examine recent changes in awareness of prediabetes and factors associated with awareness among adults agedâ‰¥20 years, CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, during 2009-2010, approximately 11% of those with prediabetes were aware of their condition. Furthermore, during 2005-2010, estimated awareness of prediabetes was <14% across all population subgroups, different levels of health-care access or use, and other factors.
