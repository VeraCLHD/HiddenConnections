Abstract Considerable epidemiological evidence has accumulated regarding the effect of postmenopausal estrogens on coronary heart disease risk. Five hospital-based case-control studies yielded inconsistent but generally null results; however, these are difficult to interpret due to the problems in selecting appropriate controls. Six population-based case-control studies found decreased relative risks among estrogen users, though only 1 was statistically significant.
