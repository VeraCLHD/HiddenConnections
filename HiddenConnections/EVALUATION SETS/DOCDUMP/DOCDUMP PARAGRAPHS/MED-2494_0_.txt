Abstract Despite considerable research we still do not have a comprehensive explanation for the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Although chronic hyperglycaemia is almost certainly involved, it is not known whether the primary pathology is metabolic, microvascular, or an interaction between the two. Hyperglycaemia-induced polyol pathway hyperactivity associated with nerve sorbitol accumulation and myo-inositol depletion may play a part in the genesis of diabetic neuropathy.
