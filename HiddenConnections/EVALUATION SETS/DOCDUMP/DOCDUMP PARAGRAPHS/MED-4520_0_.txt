Abstract Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors could, in theory, adversely affect male gonadal function because cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormones. The objective of this randomized double-blind trial was to compare the effects of simvastatin, pravastatin, and placebo on gonadal testosterone production and spermatogenesis. After a 6-week placebo and lipid-lowering diet run-in period, 159 male patients aged 21 to 55 years with type IIa or IIb hypercholesterolemia, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between 145 and 240 mg/dL, and normal basal levels of testosterone were randomly assigned to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg (n = 40), simvastatin 40 mg (n = 41), pravastatin 40 mg (n = 39), or placebo (n = 39) once daily.
