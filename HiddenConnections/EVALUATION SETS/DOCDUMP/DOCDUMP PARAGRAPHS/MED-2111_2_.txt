Retail pasteurized skimmed milk samples from Norway were found to contain 20 micrograms/kg DEHP, and two retail cream samples contained 1200 and 1400 micrograms/kg of DEHP, reflecting the association of plasticizer with the fat phase. Retail whole milks from the UK contained 35 micrograms/kg of DEHP. This contamination is believed to originate from environmental sources as DEHP plasticizer was not used in the milking equipment.
