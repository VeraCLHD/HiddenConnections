Abstract An environment that is germ free and a patient who is germ free have been goals in managing immunocompromised patients, especially those who are neutropenic. Such a germ-free environment, inside and out, can be achieved in laboratory animals after considerable manipulation, including delivery by cesarean section. This is rarely indicated or achieved in humans, but investigators have tried to decrease the numbers of organisms on the outside of patients (both environmental and on the skin) and to do the same with the inside--or at least to selectively decrease the organisms most likely to invade from mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal tract.
