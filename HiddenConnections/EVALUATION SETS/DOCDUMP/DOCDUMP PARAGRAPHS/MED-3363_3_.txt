In study 2, a subset of subjects underwent consumption conditions: solid carbohydrate, solid protein, solid fat: the same as SEW, but for each macronutrient separately; liquefied carbohydrate, liquefied protein, liquefied fat: the same as LEW, but for each macronutrient separately. Appetite, insulin concentration, glucose concentration, and ghrelin concentration were measured. Eating, independent of structure, suppressed desire to eat more than drinking (P < 0.01).
