These beta-carbolines were also found to be present in all the cooked food samples, at levels of 2.39-795 ng for norharman and 0.62-377 ng for harman per gram of cooked food. The observed concentrations are much higher than those found for mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs), suggesting that humans are exposed to norharman and harman in daily life to a larger extent than to HCAs.
