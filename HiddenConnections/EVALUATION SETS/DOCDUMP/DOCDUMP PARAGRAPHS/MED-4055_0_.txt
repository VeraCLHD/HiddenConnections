Abstract Although Erbitux (cetuximab) has proven therapeutic benefit in the clinical setting, the molecular determinants predicting responsiveness to this agent are still not very well understood. Here, we assessed the relationship between basal total and activated (pY1068) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels in a tumor and the responsiveness to cetuximab monotherapy or combination-based treatment using human xenograft models. Cetuximab treatment alone (0.25-1 mg/mouse/injection, q3d, i.p.) effectively delayed the growth of GEO and L2987 tumors by a minimum of 10 days corresponding to log cell kill values of >or=1.0.
