The association was confined to men with body mass index <25 kg/m(2), the hazard ratios were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17-1.68; P trend<0.001) for total stroke and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.13-1.70; P trend=0.001) for cerebral infarction; no association was observed among overweight and obese men. There was no association between nonheme iron intake and risk of total stroke and stroke types. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this prospective study indicate that a high heme iron intake, particularly in normal weight individuals, may increase the risk of stroke.
