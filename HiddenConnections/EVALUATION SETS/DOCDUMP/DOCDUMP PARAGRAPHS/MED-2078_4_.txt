Exposure to environmental estrogenic disruptors has been found to be directly related to the increase in the incidence of breast cancer. Zeranol (Z) is a non-steroidal anabolic growth promoter with potent estrogenic activity that is widely used in the US beef industry. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of Z- and leptin-induced proliferation of primary cultured human breast cancer epithelial cells (HBCECs).
