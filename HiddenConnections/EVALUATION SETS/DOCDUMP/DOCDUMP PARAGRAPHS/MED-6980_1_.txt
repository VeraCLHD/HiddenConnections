In addition, using the subjects' pre- and postintervention serum in vitro, serum-stimulated growth and apoptosis of three estrogen receptor-positive BCa cell lines were studied. The women where placed on a low-fat (10-15% kcal), high-fiber (30-40 g per 1,000 kcal/day) diet and attended daily exercise classes for 2 wk. Serum estradiol was reduced in the women on hormone treatment (HT; n = 28) as well as those not on HT (n = 10).
