METHODS: The rectal sensory threshold was assessed by a barostat. First, a ramp distention of 40 ml/min was induced, and the threshold of pain and the maximum tolerable pressure (mmHg) were measured. Next, RRD (phasic distentions of 60-s duration separated by 30-s intervals) was given with a tracking method until the subjects had complained of pain six times.
