Abstract A 42-year-old woman from Culiacan in the Sinaloa State of Mexico presented with a four-year history of migratory, pruritic, painful swellings of the face. Palpebral edema with conjunctival erythema developed when lesions developed near the eye. Routine eye examination showed a mobile worm in the anterior chamber.
