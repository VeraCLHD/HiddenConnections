Persons in the highest tertile of urinary cortisol had a five times increased risk of dying of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio = 5.00; 95% confidence interval = 2.02â€“12.37). This effect was found to be consistent across persons with and without cardiovascular disease at baseline (p interaction = 0.78). Conclusions: High cortisol levels strongly predict cardiovascular death among persons both with and without preexisting cardiovascular disease.
