The majority of respondents (82%) stop the neutropenic diet when oncology patients are no longer neutropenic while the practice varied significantly with SCT patients. Providers at the same institution were not consistent with implementation of the diet, patient populations placed on the neutropenic diet and parameters for initiation, discontinuation of the diet and specific food restrictions. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the neutropenic diet by pediatric oncologists remains quite variable even among those at the same institution.
