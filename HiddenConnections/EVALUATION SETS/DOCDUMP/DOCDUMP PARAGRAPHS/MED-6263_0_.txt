Abstract An analytical method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of serotonin, melatonin, trans- and cis-piceid, and trans- and cis-resveratrol using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative ionization modes. HPLC optimal analytical separation was achieved using a mixture of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase in linear gradient elution. The mass spectrometry parameters were optimized for reliable quantification and the enhanced selectivity and sensitivity selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM) was applied.
