This study investigated the effects of phenolic compounds found in extra virgin olive oil on inflammatory mediator production by human mononuclear cells. METHODS: Diluted human blood cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence of phenolics (vanillic, p-coumaric, syringic, homovanillic and caffeic acids, kaempferol, oleuropein glycoside, and tyrosol) at concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-4) M. Concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 and of the inflammatory eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Oleuropein glycoside and caffeic acid decreased the concentration of interleukin-1beta.
