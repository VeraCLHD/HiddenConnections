METHODS: In a randomized cross-over design with one-week intervals, 24 healthy normal-weight women consumed a test drink containing 1.75 g GT extract with or without the addition of different proteins. Treatments were GT (control), GT with skimmed milk (GT + M), GT with caseinate (GT + CS), or GT with soy protein (GT + S). Venous blood samples were taken before and several times during a period of 4.5 h after consumption of the test drink.
