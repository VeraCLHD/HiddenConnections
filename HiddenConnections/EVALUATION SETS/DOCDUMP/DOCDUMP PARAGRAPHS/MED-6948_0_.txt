Abstract Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) have each been associated with premenopausal breast cancer risks. We analyzed data from a cross-sectional study of 261 premenopausal Japanese women aged 20-54 yr with adequate nutritional status to evaluate the relationships between concentrations of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in serum and dietary intakes of soy, fats and other nutrients. Diet was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire.
