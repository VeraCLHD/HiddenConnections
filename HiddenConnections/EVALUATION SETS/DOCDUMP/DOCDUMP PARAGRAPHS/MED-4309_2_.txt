Methods We operationalized six recommendations (related to body fatness, physical activity, foods that promote weight gain, plant foods, red and processed meats, and alcohol) and examined their association with invasive breast cancer incidence over 6.7 years of follow-up in the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) study cohort. Participants included 30,797 post-menopausal women ages 50–76 years at baseline in 2000–2002 with no history of breast cancer. Breast cancers (n=899) were tracked through the Western Washington Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database.
