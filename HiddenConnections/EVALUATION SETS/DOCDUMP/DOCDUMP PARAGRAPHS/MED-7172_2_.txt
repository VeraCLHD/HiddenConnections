METHODS: To be enrolled in the study, women had to meet at least one of the following criteria for the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels >160 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels <50 mg/dL; or triglyceride levels >150 mg/dL. Lipid parameters were assessed and verified on blood taken at least twice in the hospital during the screening phase. Four hundred forty-one premenopausal women with hyperlipidemia were compared with 115 age-matched premenopausal women without hyperlipidemia.
