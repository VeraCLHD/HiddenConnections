The fecal ATNC were dissolved in the fecal water, and 45% had a molecular weight < 3,000. The addition of readily fermentable resistant starch to the high-meat diet significantly increased stool output from 118 to 153 g/day and decreased fecal pH from 7.2 to 6.6 but had no significant effect on fecal ATNC (151 micrograms/day), ammonia (3.7 mmol/day), whole gut transit time, urinary nitrate, or plasma urea. ATNC produced in the large bowel in association with a high-meat intake could represent an important source of DNA-damaging alkylating agents in the human large bowel.
