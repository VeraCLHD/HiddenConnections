Of the three sugars assessed (lactose, fructose, and sucrose), only the milk sugar lactose was associated with pancreatic cancer risk (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.7 comparing extreme quartiles). Conclusion These results provide limited support for the hypothesis that sweets or sugars increase pancreatic cancer risk.
