Urinary isoflavone and dietary fiber intakes were not associated with pubertal markers. CONCLUSIONS: Girls, but not boys, with higher prepubertal isoflavone intakes appear to enter puberty at a later age. Fiber intake in this sample of healthy white girls and boys was not relevant for puberty timing.
