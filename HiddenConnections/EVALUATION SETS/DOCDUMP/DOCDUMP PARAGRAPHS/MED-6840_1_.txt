We assessed the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral potassium supplement dissolved in grape juice in female hypokalemic patients with active RA. Thirty-two hypokalemic patients with active RA were investigated in a parallel, randomized design. In addition to their usual medication, the control group received placebo and the intervention group received 6000 mg chloride potassium dissolved in grape juice on 28 consecutive days.
