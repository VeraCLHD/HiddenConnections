In addition, DHEA has neurosteroidal properties and may exhibit direct action via specific binding sites on endothelial cells. There is convincing evidence for beneficial effects of DHEA in patients with adrenal insufficiency and future research will hopefully elucidate its role in patients receiving pharmacological glucocorticoid treatment. However, in healthy elderly subjects, current evidence from randomised, controlled trials does not justify the use of DHEA, with no major beneficial effects reported and, in addition, potentially adverse effects on sex steroid-dependent tumour growth need to be considered.
