Little information exists on the effect and sustainability of walnut consumption for longer duration in a free-living situation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A randomized crossover design in which 87 subjects with normal to moderate high plasma total cholesterol were initially assigned to a walnut-supplemented diet or habitual (control) diet for a 6-month period, then switched to the alternate dietary intervention for a second 6-month period. Each subject attended seven clinics 2 months apart.
