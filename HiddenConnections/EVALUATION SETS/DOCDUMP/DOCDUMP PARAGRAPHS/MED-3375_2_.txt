We compared the efficacy of different vegetables, at the same level of intake (i.e. 300 g/d), in increasing plasma levels of carotenoids, folate and vitamin C and we investigated if disruption of the vegetable matrix would enhance the bioavailability of these micronutrients. In an incomplete block design, sixty-nine volunteers consumed a control meal without vegetables and three out of four vegetable meals (i.e. broccoli, green peas, whole leaf spinach, chopped spinach; containing between 1.7 and 24.6 mg beta-carotene, 3.8 and 26 mg lutein, 0.22 and 0.60 mg folate and 26 and 93 mg vitamin C) or a meal supplemented with synthetic beta-carotene (33.3 mg). Meals were consumed for 4 d and fasting blood samples were taken at the end of each period.
