Abstract During the last few years, there has been increasing interest in buccal epithelial cells for cytogenetic evaluation of different materials. In the present study, the use of these cells and peripheral lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluation of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) with comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis, or SCGE) is reported. This technique detects DNA strand breaks in individual cells in alkaline conditions.
