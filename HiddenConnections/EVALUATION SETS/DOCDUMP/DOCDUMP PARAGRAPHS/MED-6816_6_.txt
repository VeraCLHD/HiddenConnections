Compared to Program A, Program B resulted in a significant decrease (P< .05) in the FIQpain score and stiffness score. Participants also had better pain tolerance at five tender points during Program B than during Program A. Higher metallothionein mRNA expression was observed during Program B. An increase in creatinine-adjusted mercury excretion and suggestive increase in creatinine-adjusted arsenic excretion were noted when Program B was compared to baseline.
