The joint highest tertile of serum dioxins and blood mercury was associated with elevated HOMA-IR at 11 times the odds of the joint lowest tertile (AOR 11.00, 95% CI: 4.87, 26.63). We hypothesize that simultaneous exposure to dioxins and mercury heightens the risk of insulin resistance more than does individual exposure. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
