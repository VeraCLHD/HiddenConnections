In addition, recent findings from our laboratory showing an association between individual taste sensitivity to detect sucralose and sucraloseâ€™s acute effects on metabolic response to an oral glucose load are reported. Taken as a whole, data support the notion that NNS have metabolic effects. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which NNS may drive metabolic dysregulation and better understand potential effects of these commonly used food additives.
