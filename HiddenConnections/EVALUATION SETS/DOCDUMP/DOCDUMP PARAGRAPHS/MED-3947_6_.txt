However, there was post-hoc evidence that folic acid delayed the time to onset of mood disorder in those participants who became unwell.

CONCLUSIONS: Although long term folic acid supplementation was well tolerated, with high levels of adherence, there was no evidence that it reduced the incidence of mood disorder compared to those taking placebo.
