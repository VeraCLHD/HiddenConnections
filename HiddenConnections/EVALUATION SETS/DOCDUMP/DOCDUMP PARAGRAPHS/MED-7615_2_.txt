After the clinical trial the patients were free to change diet or medication and after approximately one year they were asked to attend a new clinical examination. We compared the change from baseline (i.e. at the time of study entry) to the time of the follow-up examination for diet responders, diet nonresponders and controls who ate an omnivorous diet. The following variables favoured diet responders: pain score, duration of morning stiffness, Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire index, number of tender joints, Ritchie's articular index, number of swollen joints, ESR and platelet count [corrected].
