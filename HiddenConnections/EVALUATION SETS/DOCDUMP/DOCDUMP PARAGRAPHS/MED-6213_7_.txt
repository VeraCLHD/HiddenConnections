Lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS) and protein oxidation marker (PCC) were significantly elevated in HN and HA treated groups. Enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were slightly decreased in their activities compared to control (untreated HT-29 cells). Results of Western blot analysis of apoptosis associated genes revealed an increase in cytochrome C, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 expression.
