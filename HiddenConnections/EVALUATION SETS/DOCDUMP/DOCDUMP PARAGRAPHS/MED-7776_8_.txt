Fruit intake and total plant foods intake were significantly lower in the constipated than non-constipated children: (61 g/d (IQR: 23.8-115 g/d) vs. 78 g/d (IQR: 41.7-144.6 g/d); P = 0.047) and (142.5 g/d (IQR: 73.7-214.7 g/d) vs. 161.1 g/d (IQR: 98.3-233.3 g/d); P = 0.034), respectively. Total fluid intake did not differ between groups but milk intake among the constipated children was marginally higher than the non-constipated children (P = 0.055) CONCLUSION: Insufficient dietary fibre intake is common in Hong Kong pre-school children. Constipated children had significantly lower intakes of dietary fibre and micronutrients including vitamin C, folate and magnesium than non-constipated counterparts which was attributable to under-consumption of plant foods.
