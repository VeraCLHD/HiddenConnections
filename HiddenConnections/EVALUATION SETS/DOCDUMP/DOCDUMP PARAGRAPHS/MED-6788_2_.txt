PhIP causes mammary carcinomas in female rats and mice, and is associated with an increased risk of developing colon, breast, and prostate cancer in humans. PhIP is metabolized by cytochrome P-450s producing N-OH-PhIP. The N-OH-PhIP can be esterified by phase II enzymes forming an arylnitrenium ion that binds to DNA causing adducts.
