Hydrocortisone (1.0%) and betamethasone valerate (0.1%) in the vehicle served as positive controls.The vehicle was used as place-bo. The effect of the test substances on the UV-induced erythema was measured photometrically after 48 hours.Additionally,the skin tolerance of the test preparations was assessed on non-irradiated skin. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, the lipolotion with 0.5% coriander oil significantly reduced the UV-induced erythema, but it was not as effective as hydrocortisone.
