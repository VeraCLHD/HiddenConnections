Participants were population-based controls who took part in a multicenter case-control study, aged 18-61 yr and resident in one of four study regions ranging in latitude from 27°S to 43°S. Data were derived from a self-administered questionnaire, interview and examination by a research officer and biologic sampling. Latitude and longitude coordinates were geocoded from participants' residential locations and climatic data were linked to postcodes of current residence. Stored serum was analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and silicone rubber casts of the skin were used as an objective measure of cumulative actinic damage.
