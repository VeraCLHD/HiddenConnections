A significantly higher mortality rate was noted in patients with initial presentations of a systolic blood pressure of < or =90 mm Hg, leukopenia, decreased platelet counts, and a combination of hepatic dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Vibrio necrotizing soft-tissue infections should be suspected in patients with appropriate clinical findings and history of contact with seawater or seafood. V. cholerae non-O1 may cause bacteremia more often than V. vulnificus in patients with liver cirrhosis.
