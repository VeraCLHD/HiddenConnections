Results Medication vs placebo differences varied substantially as a function of baseline severity. Among patients with Hamilton scores below 23, Cohenâ€™s d-type effect sizes for the difference between medication and placebo were estimated to be < .20 (a standard definition of a small effect). Estimates of the magnitude of the superiority of medication over placebo increased with increases in baseline Hamilton severity and crossed the NICE threshold for a clinically significant difference at a baseline score of 25.
