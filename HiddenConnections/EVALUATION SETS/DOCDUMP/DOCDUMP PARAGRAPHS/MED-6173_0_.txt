Abstract INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether men with erectile dysfunction (ED) ultimately die of cardiovascular (CV) causes. AIM: This study examined the causes of death in men with ED and their risk of CV death. METHODS: Based on statutory death registrations and hospital morbidity data, the risk of CV death in men with ED in a linked-data study was assessed against the CV mortality risk in a reference male population.
