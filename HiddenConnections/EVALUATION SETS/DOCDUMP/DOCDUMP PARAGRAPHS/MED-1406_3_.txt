Both studies were conducted in New York in 2011. RESULTS: Study 1 found that elementary students ate twice the percentage of their carrots if attractively named as "X-ray Vision Carrots," than if un-named or generically named as the "Food of the Day." Study 2 found that elementary school students were 16% more likely to persistently choose more hot vegetable dishes (p<0.001) when they were given fun or attractive names.
