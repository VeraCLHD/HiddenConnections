Abstract Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a negative impact on sperm DNA, leading to the formation of oxidative products such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroxyguanosine. This compound causes fragmentation and, thus, has a mutagenic effect. Patient treatment with oral antioxidant vitamins is, therefore, standard practice for male infertility, in an attempt to decrease formation of ROS and improve fertility.
