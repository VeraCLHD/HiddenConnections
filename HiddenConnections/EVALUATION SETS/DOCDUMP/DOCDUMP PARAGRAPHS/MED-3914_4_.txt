Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for exposure time windows, residential exposure location, biocide category and type of leukaemia. RESULTS: RR estimates were extracted from 13 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2009. Statistically significant associations with childhood leukaemia were observed when combining all studies (mRR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.37-2.21).
