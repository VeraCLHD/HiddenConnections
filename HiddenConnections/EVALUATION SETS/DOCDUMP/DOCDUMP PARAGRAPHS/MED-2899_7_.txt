Median (25th, 75th percentile) for anti-TGab, 38 (34, 42) and 37 (30, 42) U/mL triclosan and placebo groups respectively; anti-TPOab, 15 (10, 22) and 18 (10, 24) U/mL. At year 5, fT4 was the only measure to show a significant difference between groups (mean and 95% Confidence Interval) 15.6 (15.1, 16.1) and 14.7 (14.2, 15.1) pmol/L triclosan and placebo respectively (p=0.01). This reflects reduced levels in the placebo group but no change in the triclosan group.
