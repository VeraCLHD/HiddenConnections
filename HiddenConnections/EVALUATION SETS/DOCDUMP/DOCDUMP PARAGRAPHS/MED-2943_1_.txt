Although a number of ApoE functions are isoform dependent and may underlie the "risk factor" activity of AD, its ability to bind amyloid beta peptides and influence their clearance and/or deposition has gained strong experimental support. Evidence suggests that in addition to genotype, increased ApoE transcription can contribute to AD risk. There is growing evidence in support of the hypothesis that disrupted cholesterol metabolism is an early risk factor for AD.
