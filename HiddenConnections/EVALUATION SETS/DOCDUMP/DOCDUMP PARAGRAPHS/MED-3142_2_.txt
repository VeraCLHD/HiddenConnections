The lifetime survival functions for the cancer cohort and age-/sex-matched reference population were generated using a semi-parametric extrapolation method with annual life tables. The average expected years of life lost (EYLL) for cancers were calculated by subtracting the estimated life expectancy of the cancer cohorts from that of the reference population. RESULTS: Liver cancer and lung cancer had an average EYLL of over 13 years, while the EYLL for prostate cancer was below 2 years.
