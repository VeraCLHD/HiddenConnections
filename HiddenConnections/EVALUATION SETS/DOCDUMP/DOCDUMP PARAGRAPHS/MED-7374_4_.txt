The estimated U.S. annual incidence of SCD varied widely from 180,000 to > 450,000 among 6 included studies. These different estimates were in part due to different data sources (with data age ranging from 1980 to 2007), definitions of SCD, case ascertainment criteria, methods of estimation/extrapolation, and sources of case ascertainment. The true incidence of SCA and/or SCD in the U.S. remains unclear with a wide range in the available estimates, which are badly dated.
