Daily glycemia in the presurgery period was significantly lower (1,293.58 mg/dL·day [1,096.83–1,490.33) vs. 1,478.80 mg/dL·day [1,277.47–1,680.13]) compared with the postsurgery period (P = 0.02 between periods). The improvements in the fasting and maximum poststimulation glucose and 6-h glucose area under the curve (primary outcome) were similar during both periods. CONCLUSIONS Glucose homeostasis improved in response to a reduced caloric diet, with a greater effect observed in the absence of surgery as compared with after RYGB.
