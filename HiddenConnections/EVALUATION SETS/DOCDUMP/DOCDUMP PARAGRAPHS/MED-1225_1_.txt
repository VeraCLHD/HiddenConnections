This project sought to examine the relation between egg intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes in two large prospective cohorts. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—In this prospective study, we used data from two completed randomized trials: 20,703 men from the Physicians' Health Study I (1982–2007) and 36,295 women from the Women's Health Study (1992–2007). Egg consumption was ascertained using questionnaires, and we used the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate relative risks of type 2 diabetes.
