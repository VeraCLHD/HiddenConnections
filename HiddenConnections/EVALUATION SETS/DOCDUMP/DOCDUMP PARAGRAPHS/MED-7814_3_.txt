The hot aqueous extract (HAE) contained 22.27 +/- 2.52 mg of protocatechuic acid (PCA) per gram of lyophilized dried extract, and was not statistically different from the cold aqueous or chloroform extracts; the ethyl acetate extract produced the least amount of PCA. The H. sabdariffa extracts inhibited mutagenicity of 1-NP in a dose-response manner. The inhibition rate on HeLa cells of HAE was also dose-dependent.
