Data were analyzed using general linear model SAS procedures to determine significant differences (P < or = 0.05) in individual sensory attributes due to marinade treatment. All sensory attributes were scored in the low intensity range (1.5 to 5.0). Brothy, vinegar, and residual particles were the only individual attributes rated significantly different (P < or = 0.05) due to treatment.
