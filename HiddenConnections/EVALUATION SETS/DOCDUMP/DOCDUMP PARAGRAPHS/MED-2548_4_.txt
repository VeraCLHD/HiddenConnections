This review offers sections that explore Pb's persistence in the environment, bioaccumulation in fish and birds, and toxic characteristics in the human body. It further examines how Pb's effects on transcription factors could explain the observed Pb lines in Pb-poisoned individuals. This review also evaluates the relationship between the properties of persistence and bioaccumulation as a means to determine whether or not they are interconnected, interdependent, or independent of one another.
