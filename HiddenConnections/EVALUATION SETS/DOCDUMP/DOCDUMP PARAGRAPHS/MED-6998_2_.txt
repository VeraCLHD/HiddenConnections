Food consumption was assessed by using two non-consecutive 24 h dietary recalls. About 3083 participants ( ≥ 15 years of age; 1546 males, 1537 females) provided completed dietary information. Animal protein intake (47 g/d) contributed more to total protein intakes of 72 g/d than plant protein intake, which accounted for 25 g/d.
