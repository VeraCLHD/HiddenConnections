Yet diffusion remains poorly understood due to the paucity of reliable methods to study diffusion noninvasively in humans in vivo. In recent years, postcontrast MRI has emerged as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing diffusion in lumbar discs. Since it is noninvasive and safe, it can be used to document the process of diffusion temporally over a period of 24 hours.
