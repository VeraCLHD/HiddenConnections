There was, however, no significant difference between the NK cell activity in trained and untrained after exposure to indomethacin in vitro. Indomethacin-enhanced NK cell activity was 45.9% (range 24.4%-67.5%) in trained and 40.0% (range 23.9%-68.5%) in untrained (P = 0.138). Mean %CD14+ cells was 8.3% (range 2%-15%) in trained vs 3.8% (2%-8%) in untrained (P less than 0.0001).
