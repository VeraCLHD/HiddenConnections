Abstract BACKGROUND: High adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD) is associated with reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk. To our knowledge, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that has compared the effects of an MD on outcomes of endothelial function and inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Trial Register.
