Although zoonotic and foodborne transmission have not been confirmed, it is evident that susceptible people can be inadvertently exposed to C. difficile from foods, animals, or their environment.

In order to develop science-based prevention strategies, it is critical to understand how C. difficile reaches foods and humans.
