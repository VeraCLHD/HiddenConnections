Regression models were used to examine the impact of animal or plant protein and other macronutrient intakes on subsequent body weight. After controlling for potential confounders, none of the calorie-contributing nutrient intakes at baseline was associated with subsequent weight at 6 or 18 months. However, a greater intake of saturated fat at 6 months was associated with higher weight at 18 months (P = 0.002).
