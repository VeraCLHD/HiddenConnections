METHODS: A total of 1,579,310 patients diagnosed with cancers of the lung, colon and rectum, liver, breast, cervix, or prostate in 1992-2005 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. The lifetime survival functions for the cancer cohort and age-/sex-matched reference population were generated using a semi-parametric extrapolation method with annual life tables. The average expected years of life lost (EYLL) for cancers were calculated by subtracting the estimated life expectancy of the cancer cohorts from that of the reference population.
