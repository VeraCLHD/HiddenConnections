Thirty-two Mahabadi male kids were randomly assigned to one of four diets with different levels of PSP: 1 - diet without PSP (Control), 2 - diet containing 5% PSP (PSP5), 3 - diet containing 10% PSP (PSP10), and 4 - diet containing 15% PSP (PSP15). The kids were slaughtered at the end of the study and m. longissimus lumborum (LL) was sampled. The TBARS values of both raw and cooked meat were decreased (P<0.0001) by increasing levels of PSP in the diet.
