The lower and higher protein diets contained 213 +/- 21 and 610 +/- 105 mg cholesterol/d, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Strength, body composition, serum lipid-lipoprotein profile, urinary creatinine, skeletal muscle fiber type and size. RESULTS: Among all subjects, over time (i.e. with RT) body weight was unchanged, lean mass (1.1 +/- 0.2 kg) increased, and fat mass (-1.4 +/- 0.2 kg) decreased (all changes P < 0.05).
