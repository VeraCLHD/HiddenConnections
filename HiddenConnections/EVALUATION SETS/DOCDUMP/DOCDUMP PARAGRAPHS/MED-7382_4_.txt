Blood samples were drawn before and after treatment periods, and the compositions of the LCPUFA in blood lipid fractions were measured. The supplementation of ARA increased the composition of ARA, but did not decrease the composition of n-3LCPUFA in erythrocyte phospholipids and plasma phospholipids, esterified cholesterol, and triacylglycerol. We found that dietary ARA increased the ARA level in all lipid fractions of the blood, even at a very low dose.
