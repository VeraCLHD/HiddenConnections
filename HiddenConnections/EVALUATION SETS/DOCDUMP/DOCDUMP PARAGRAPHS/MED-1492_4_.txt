The patients scored each day in a diary the abdominal pain and bloating intensities following the 5-point Likert scale. The weekly symptom mean scores and the final patient subjective evaluation on treatment effectiveness were statistically compared among groups and intra-groups with appropriate tests. RESULTS: Eight patients dropped from the study: 6 in the red pepper group for abdominal pain and 2 in the placebo group.
