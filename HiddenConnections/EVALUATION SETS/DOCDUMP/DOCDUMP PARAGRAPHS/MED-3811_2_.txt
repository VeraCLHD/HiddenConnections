The aim was to examine the association between intakes of total fiber and fiber from different dietary sources and progression of coronary-artery atherosclerosis among women with established CAD. METHODS: A prospective cohort study involved postmenopausal women (n = 229) participating in the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial. Usual fiber intake was estimated at baseline using a food frequency questionnaire.
