Abstract Background Higher levels of resting heart rate (HR) have been associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) but mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and rate-modulating drugs explain the HR-SCD relationship. Objective We evaluated the relationship between HR, severe LVSD, rate-affecting medications and SCD in the community, using a case-control approach.
