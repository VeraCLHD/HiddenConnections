GFR (as 51Cr-EDTA clearance) was measured in 18 vegans, 16 lactovegetarians and 18 omnivorous control subjects, matched for age. Omnivores ate significantly more total protein and protein of animal origin than the other two groups. Vegetable protein comprised 100% of the vegans' daily protein intake and 64% of the lactovegetarians', both significantly higher than the omnivores' (32%).
