Several studies indicated an association of fasting adiponectin with parameters of the metabolic syndrome. We investigated postprandial adiponectin release and its relation to traits of the metabolic syndrome. Serum adiponectin concentration after an oral glucose tolerance test and after ingestion of a standardised mixed, fat-containing meal in 110 male non-diabetic subjects was assessed.
