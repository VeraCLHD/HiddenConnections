NEFAs cause beta-cell apoptosis and may thus contribute to progressive beta-cell loss in Type 2 diabetes. The molecular pathways and regulators involved in NEFA-mediated beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis are beginning to be understood. We have identified ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress as one of the molecular mechanisms implicated in NEFA-induced beta-cell apoptosis.
