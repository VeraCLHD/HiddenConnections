Abstract Sorbic acid, sodium sorbate and potassium sorbate were tested for their genotoxic potential in the Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblast micronucleus assay and the SHE cell transformation test in vitro. Sorbic acid and potassium sorbate showed no activity in either test system. When freshly prepared sodium sorbate solutions were used, no genotoxic or cell-transforming activity was detected.
