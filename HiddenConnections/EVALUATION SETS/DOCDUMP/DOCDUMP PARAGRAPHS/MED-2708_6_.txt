Dietary assessment was performed with a food frequency questionnaire. Dietary intakes of copper and fats were related to change in global cognitive score (the mean of the 4 tests) among 3718 participants. RESULTS: Among persons whose diets were high in saturated and trans fats, higher copper intake was associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline.
