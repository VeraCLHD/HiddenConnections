Perfusion pressure computed as the mean arterial pressure minus cerebral spinal fluid pressure and internal carotid artery blood flow were used to calculate an index of cerebral vascular resistance. The data indicate that a modest but significant decrease in vascular resistance occurred during phases II and III followed by return to control levels during phase IV. These changes in vascular resistance were not rapid enough or of sufficient magnitude to maintain constant cerebral perfusion during the Valsalva maneuver.
