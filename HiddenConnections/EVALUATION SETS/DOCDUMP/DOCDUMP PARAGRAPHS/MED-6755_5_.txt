Periodontal parameters of probing depth and periodontal attachment level were recorded. Five patients with ED and CP were selected randomly for cardiac color Doppler to assess the integrity. RESULTS: Among the selected vasculogenic patients with ED, mild-to-moderate vasculogenic ED showed the highest prevalence, whereas prevalence for CP among all vasculogenic patients with ED was highest among severe ED (81.8%).
