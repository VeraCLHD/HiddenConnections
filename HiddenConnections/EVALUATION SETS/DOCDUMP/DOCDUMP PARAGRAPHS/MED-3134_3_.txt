In their initial test, participants were randomized to either 16 oz (473 mL) of water drinking 5 minutes before tilt-table testing or tilt-table testing alone, with the alternative in a second test on a different day. During the first 30 minutes of tilt, 8 of 22 subjects without water experienced presyncope but only 1 of 22 who had ingested water (P=0.016). Water drinking attenuated the heart rate increase associated with tilt (P<0.001) while accentuating the increase in total peripheral resistance (P=0.012).
