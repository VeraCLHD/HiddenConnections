Our aim was to assess the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality in middle-aged adults from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project. We followed 15,535 Spanish university graduates for a mean of 6.8 y. Their mean age was 38 Â± 12 y, 59.6% were females, and all were initially free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.
