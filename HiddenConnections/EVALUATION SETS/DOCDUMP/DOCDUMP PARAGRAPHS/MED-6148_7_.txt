Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that when a threshold of 13 cm/seconds was chosen, flaccid PSV was predictive for dynamic PSV < 25 and <35 cm/seconds with an accuracy of 89% and 82%, respectively. Among the subset of patients who underwent SPECT, an impaired coronary flow reserve (ICFR) occurred in nine cases (45%). When the same threshold of <13 cm/seconds was chosen, PSV before SPECT was predictive of ICFR with an accuracy of 80% (area under the ROC curve = 0.798 +/- 0.10; P < 0.05).
