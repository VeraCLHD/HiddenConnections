Total ITC in the cruciferous mixture and total ITC and their metabolites in urine was quantified as the cyclocondensation product of 1,2-bezenedithiol by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The total urinary excretion of ITCs correlated significantly with the two doses of ITC from diets with high or low cruciferous content (r (s )= 0.90, P < 0.01). The fraction of urinary ITC excreted was 69.02 +/- 11.57% and 74.53 +/- 8.39% of the amounts ingested for 80 and 350 g cruciferous vegetables, respectively.
