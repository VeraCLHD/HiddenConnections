Moreover, palmitic, but not oleic acid, impaired insulin signalling. Despite the higher amount of fat resulting from incubation of the two fatty acids combined, the apoptosis rate and impaired insulin signalling were lower than in cells treated with palmitic acid alone, indicating a protective effect of oleic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Oleic acid is more steatogenic but less apoptotic than palmitic acid in hepatocityc cell cultures.
