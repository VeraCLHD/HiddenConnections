Relative risk for lung cancer incidence for men and women was 1.005-1.076 from a single examination. CONCLUSION: EDs and organ doses from 64-detector CT are higher than those previously reported for adult cardiac and pulmonary CT angiography protocols. Risk for breast and lung cancer induction from these studies is greatest for the younger patient population.
