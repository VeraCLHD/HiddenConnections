Exercise may favorably influence telomere length, although results are inconsistent regarding the duration and type of exercise and the cell type used to measure telomere length. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between habitual physical exercise and telomere length in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women were chosen as study participants because they are typically estrogen deficient.
