Abstract Fat is stored around the abdomen in both subcutaneous and intra abdominal (visceral) sites. Visceral fat is associated in its own right with a set of metabolic abnormalities, including non insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemias. States of marked hypercortisolaemia, for example Cushing's syndrome, lead to the preferential accumulation of visceral fat.
