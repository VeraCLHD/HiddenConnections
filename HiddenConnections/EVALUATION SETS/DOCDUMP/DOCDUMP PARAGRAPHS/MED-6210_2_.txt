Five quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in endive was shown for the first time.
