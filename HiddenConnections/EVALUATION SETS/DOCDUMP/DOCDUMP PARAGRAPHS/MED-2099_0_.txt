Abstract The underlying mechanism in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PO) is an imbalance between bone resorption and formation. This study was conducted to investigate whether oxidative stress (OxS) might have a role in this derangement of bone homeostasis. In a sample of 167 postmenopausal women, we found that increased serum levels of a lipid peroxidation marker, hydroperoxides, were negatively and independently associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in total body (r = −0.192, P < 0.05), lumbar spine (r = −0.282, P < 0.01), and total hip (r = −0.282, P < 0.05), as well as with increased bone resorption rate (r = 0.233, P < 0.05), as assessed by the serum concentration of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-1).
