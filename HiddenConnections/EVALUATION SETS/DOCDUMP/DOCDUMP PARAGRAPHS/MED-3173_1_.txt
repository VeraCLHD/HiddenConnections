The area under the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) curve rose above base line by 1,904 +/- 292 in normals and 502 +/- 237 ml/1.73 m2 in IDDs (P less than 0.01). The meat meal induced a greater increment in the area under the glucagon curve in normals (14,930 +/- 186 pg.ml-1. min-1) than in IDDs (7,227 +/- 67, P less than 0.01); similarly urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha rose by 119 and 98%, respectively, in normals but only by 2% (P less than 0.01 vs. normals) and 10% (P less than 0.01 vs. normals) in IDDs.
