Competitive radioligand binding assays using recombinant human cannabinoid receptors expressed in Chem-1 and CHO cells identified (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, EGCG (K(i)=33.6 microM), (-)-epigallocatechin, EGC (K(i)=35.7 microM), and (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, ECG (K(i)=47.3 microM) as ligands with moderate affinity for type 1 cannabinoid receptors, CB1. Binding to CB2 was weaker with inhibition constants exceeding 50 microM for EGC and ECG. The epimers (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin exhibited negligible affinities for both CB1 and CB2.
