METHOD: In a case control study, patients diagnosed with ET and healthy controls underwent a standardized questionnaire interview to evaluate the exposure to coffee and tea intake. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to evaluate the association of caffeine intake and other environmental factors with risk of ET. RESULTS: 179 subjects including 79 ET patients and 100 controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity were included in the analysis.
