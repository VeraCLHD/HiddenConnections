A dynamic duplex study after intracavernosal injection of a bimix solution (60 mg papaverine + 2 mg phentolamine mesylate) was carried out using a color ultrasound machine. The patients underwent a stress ECG test, carried out on a motor-driven treadmill according to the 'Bruce Protocol'. A total of 12 patients were diagnosed with positive ischemic heart disease (IHD).
