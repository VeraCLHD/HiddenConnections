Fish consumption was positively associated with intact and split proinsulin/C-peptide ratios, however, these associations were confounded by ethnicity (multivariable-adjusted β=0.073 [−0.014, 0.16] for intact proinsulin/C-peptide ratio, β=0.031 [−0.065, 0.13] for split proinsulin/C-peptide ratio). We also observed a significant positive association between fish consumption and fasting blood glucose (multivariable-adjusted β=2.27 [0.68, 3.86], p=0.005). We found no association between fish consumption and SI (multivariable-adjusted β= −0.015 [−0.083, 0.053]) or fasting insulin (multivariable-adjusted β=0.016 [−0.066, 0.10]).
