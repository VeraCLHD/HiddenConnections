This is partly explained by low occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, which in turn is attributed to the Japanese traditional diet (JTD). Recent research demonstrates that nitric oxide (NO), a key regulator of vascular integrity, can be generated from nitrate (NO(3)(-)), abundantly found in vegetables. It can reduce blood pressure (BP) via its serial reduction to nitrite (NO(2)(-)) and to bioactive NO.
