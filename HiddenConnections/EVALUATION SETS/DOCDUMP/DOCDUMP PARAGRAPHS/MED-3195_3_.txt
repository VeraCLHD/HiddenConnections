Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the magnitude of association. Seven organochlorines, dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, heptachlor epoxide, and PCBs 153 and 180 were detected in at least 20% of all study participants. Adjusting for age, body mass index, and a history of prostatitis, oxychlordane and PCB 180 were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.
