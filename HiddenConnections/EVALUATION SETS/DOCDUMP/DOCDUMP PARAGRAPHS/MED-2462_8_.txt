In conclusion, acute DRW consumption had no effect on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in dyslipidaemic postmenopausal women. However, the consumption of full-compliment RW exacerbated the postprandial lipaemic and insulin response over the 6-h period. Collectively, our findings suggest that neither polyphenols nor red wine reduce atherosclerotic risk by acutely modulating postprandial lipaemia over a 6-h period.
