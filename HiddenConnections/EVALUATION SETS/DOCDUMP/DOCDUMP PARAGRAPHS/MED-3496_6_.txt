Flow-mediated vasodilatation was significantly impaired in CAD patients (from 3.04 +/- 0.39 to 1.69 +/- 0.23%, P < 0.01) and control participants (from 6.58 +/- 0.52 to 4.87 +/- 0.19%, P < 0.05) after a high-fat meal. The impairment of flow-mediated dilatation was more severe in CAD patients (44.41%) than in control participants (25.99%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Postprandial endothelium-dependent vasodilatation after a single high-fat meal was severely impaired in normocholesterolemic CAD patients and control participants.
