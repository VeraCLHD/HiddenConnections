Yanomamo women had significantly higher total cholesterol (P = 0.02) and body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.05) than men. HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.08) and LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.21) were also somewhat higher among women. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that estimated age was independently related to cholesterol in both sexes, while BMI was of borderline significance.
