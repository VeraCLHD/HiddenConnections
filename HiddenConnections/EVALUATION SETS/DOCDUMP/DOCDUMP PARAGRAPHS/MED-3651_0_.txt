Abstract Much evidence indicates that there is an increased motor activity in the colon from eating in several species of animals. Though some of this effect may be cephalic in origin, the greater part of the response results from the arrival of food in the stomach and proximal intestine. Chemoreceptor stimulation appears to be more important than mechanoreceptor stimulation in bringing about this effect.
