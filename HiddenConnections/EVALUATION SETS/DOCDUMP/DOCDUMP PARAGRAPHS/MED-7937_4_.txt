During 12 years of follow-up (1990-2002), the authors documented 938 nonfatal myocardial infarctions and 324 CHD deaths among 66,360 women. They observed no association between flavonol or flavone intake and risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD. However, a weak risk reduction for CHD death was found among women with a higher intake of kaempferol, an individual flavonol found primarily in broccoli and tea.
