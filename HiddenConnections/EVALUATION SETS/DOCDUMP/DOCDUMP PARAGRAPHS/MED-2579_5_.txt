Results: Assessments were completed by 81 children in the treatment group (mean ± SD age: 835± 50.4 d) and 77 children in the control group (839 ± 65.6 d). There was no effect of supplementation on primary outcomes [distractibility mean difference: −0.2 s (95% CI: −0.7, 0.4 s); WMIC mean difference: 8.9 mm (95% CI: −10.6, 28.3 mm)]. There was no difference between DHA-supplemented and control groups except that treatment-group children looked away from the toys fewer times than controls when presented with multiple toys competing for attention but less accurately remembered a repeated hiding location.
