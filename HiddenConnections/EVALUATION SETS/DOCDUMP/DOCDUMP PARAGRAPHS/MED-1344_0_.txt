Abstract High dietary acid load (DAL) may be detrimental to bone mineral density (BMD). The objectives of the study were to: 1) evaluate the cross-sectional relation between DAL and BMD; 2) determine whether calcium intake modifies this association. Men (n=1218) and women (n=907) ≥60y were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008.
