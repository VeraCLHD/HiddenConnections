There was no association between heme iron intake and nonfatal AMI, or between non-heme iron intake and fatal or nonfatal AMI. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this prospective study indicate that a high heme iron intake, particularly with simultaneous low intake of minerals that can decrease iron absorption, may increase the risk of fatal AMI.
