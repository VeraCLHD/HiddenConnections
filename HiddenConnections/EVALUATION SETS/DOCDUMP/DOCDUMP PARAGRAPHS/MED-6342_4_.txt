Further, treatment with zingerone (10Î¼g/ml) before irradiation significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells analyzed microscopically method and by DNA ladder assay. Similarly, the radiation induced reactive oxygen species levels were significantly (P<0.01) inhibited by zingerone. Our study demonstrates the protective effect of zingerone against radiation induced DNA damage and antiapoptotic effect in human lymphocytes, which may be partly attributed to scavenging of radiation induced free radicals and also by the inhibition of radiation induced oxidative stress.
