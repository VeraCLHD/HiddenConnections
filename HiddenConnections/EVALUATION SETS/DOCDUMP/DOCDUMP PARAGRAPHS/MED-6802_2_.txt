Nutrient residuals were calculated through regression analysis. After adjustment for potential confounders (which included family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, body-mass index, total energy and total alcohol intake), an increased risk associated with consumption of total meat intake, red meat intake, total fat and saturated fat intake was observed. The strongest effect was observed for red meat intake (OR 4.2, 95% CL 2.3-7.7) for consumption in the upper quartile, after controlling for protein and fat intake.
