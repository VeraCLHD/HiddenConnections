The intestinal microflora may play a particular role in this respect, as it is the major external driving force in the maturation of the immune system after birth, and animal experiments have shown it to be a prerequisite for normal development of oral tolerance. Recent studies have shown differences in the composition of the microflora between healthy and allergic infants in countries with a high and low prevalence of allergies and between healthy and allergic infants within such countries. These differences are apparent within the first week of life and thus precede clinical symptoms.
