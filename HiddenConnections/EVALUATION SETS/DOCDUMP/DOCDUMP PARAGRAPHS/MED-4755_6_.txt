Several potential new members of this structural class were identified using this approach. Molecular modeling of a portion of one of these, prolactin inhibitory factor, reveals a strongly amphipathic alpha helix at residues 4-21. This computer-based method may enable rapid identification of peptides of the amphipathic alpha-helix class.
