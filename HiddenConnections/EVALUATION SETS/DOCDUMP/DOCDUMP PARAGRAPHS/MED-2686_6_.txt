Consumption of cRB produced the largest pH drop compared to the other food groups at 10 minutes (P < .001). Addition of raisins to bran flakes (eRB) promoted a less pronounced pH drop beyond 10 minutes when compared to bran flakes alone (P < .001). Consumption of raisins or eRB did not reduce plaque pH below 6 over the 30-minute testing period.
