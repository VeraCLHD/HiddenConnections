In addition, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase can catalyse arachidonic acid conversion and lipoxins A and B are amongst the possible products. Many of these metabolites of arachidonic acid feature prominently in the development of inflammation. Prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin are potent vasodilators, while leukotriene D4 causes cellular adhesion, chemotaxis of neutrophils and degranulation.
