Abstract Brains of 42 individuals between the ages of 4 and 29 were examined with antibodies (AT8, 4G8) and silver stains for the presence of intraneuronal and extracellular protein aggregates associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thirty-eight of 42 (38/42) cases displayed abnormally phosphorylated tau protein (pretangle material) in nerve cells or in portions of their cellular processes, and 41/42 individuals showed no extracellular amyloid-Î² protein deposition or neuritic plaques-an individual with Down syndrome was the only exception. In 16/42 cases abnormal tau was found in the transentorhinal region, and in 3/42 cases this site was Gallyas-positive for isolated NFTs (NFT stage I).
