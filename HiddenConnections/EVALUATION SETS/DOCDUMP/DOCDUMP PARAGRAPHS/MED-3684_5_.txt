Ingestion of any of the three fat emulsions resulted in reduction in insulin clearance, and SFA ingestion reduced insulin sensitivity. PUFA ingestion was associated with an absolute reduction in GSIS, whereas insulin secretion failed to compensate for insulin resistance in subjects who ingested SFA. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Oral ingestion of fats with differing degrees of saturation resulted in different effects on insulin secretion and action.
