However there are compelling reasons why 25(OH)D should preferably exceed 75 nmol/L: (A) Scrutiny of actual data specified by the IOM relating 25(OH)D to bone density and osteomalacia shows the desirable minimum 25(OH)D to be 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL). (B) Humans are primates, optimized through evolution to inhabit tropical latitudes, with serum 25(OH)D over 100 nmol/L. (C) Epidemiologic relationships show health benefits if 25(OH)D levels exceed 70 nmol/L; these include fewer falls, better tooth attachment, less colorectal cancer, improved depression and wellbeing.
