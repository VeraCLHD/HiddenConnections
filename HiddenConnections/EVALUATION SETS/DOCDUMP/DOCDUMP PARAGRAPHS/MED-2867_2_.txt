This study was designed to investigate whether intervention with a natural dietary source rich in lycopene protects against UV-induced erythema in humans. Tomato paste (40 g), providing approximately 16 mg/d of lycopene, was ingested with 10 g of olive oil over a period of 10 wk by 9 volunteers. Controls (n = 10) received olive oil only.
