Abstract Diffusion is the only source of nutrition to the intervertebral discs, and alteration of diffusion is considered to be the final common pathway for disc degeneration. Yet diffusion remains poorly understood due to the paucity of reliable methods to study diffusion noninvasively in humans in vivo. In recent years, postcontrast MRI has emerged as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing diffusion in lumbar discs.
