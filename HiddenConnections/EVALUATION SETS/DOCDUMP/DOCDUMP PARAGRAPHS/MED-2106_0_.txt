Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidative status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis. We also investigate the relation between bone mineral density and oxidative/antioxidative parameters. Thirty-nine patients with osteoporosis and 26 healthy controls were included in the study.
