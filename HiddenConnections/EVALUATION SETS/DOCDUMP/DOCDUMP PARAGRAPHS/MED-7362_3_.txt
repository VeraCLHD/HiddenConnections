However, sodium sorbate as stored solution, which previously had been heated and sonicated to facilitate solubilization, yielded a positive response in both test systems. It is concluded that oxidation products of sodium sorbate that possess genotoxic and cell-transforming properties are formed under conditions of heating, sonication and storage.
