Three distinct patterns of abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake were noted: pattern A (uptake localizing to supraclavicular area fat [USA-fat], i.e., without corresponding lymph node or muscle uptake on CT), pattern B (uptake localizing to muscle on CT), and pattern C (uptake localizing to lymph nodes or soft-tissue masses on CT). RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (14.1%) (32 female, 17 male; mean age, 51.4 +/- 15.6 y; age range, 12-77 y) showed abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake in the supraclavicular region. Twenty patients (5.8%) had muscle uptake (group B); 15 (4.3%) had definite abnormal lymph nodes (group C).
