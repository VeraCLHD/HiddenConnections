The TBARS concentration increased in parallel with plasma glucose level in each group (NGT: 1.43+/-0.07, 2.03+/-0.12 and 1.80+/-0.12, respectively; IGT: 1.65+/-0.11, 2.46+/-0.12** and 1.94+/-0.08*, respectively; DM: 1.73+/-0.07, 2.34+/-0.08** and 2.47+/-0.09** nmol/ml, respectively; *p < 0.05 vs. fasting, **p < 0.01 vs. fasting). Glucose loading did not change nitrite/nitrate concentration in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia in response to oral glucose loading rapidly suppresses endothelium-dependent vasodilation, probably through increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals.
