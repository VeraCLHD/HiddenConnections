A particularly high relative risk was also noted in association with low coffee consumption (OR = 1.59, with p less than 0.05 for trend). No consistent trends were noted for fat or fibre intakes. For non-dietary variables investigated, a history of cholecystectomy increased the risk of both cancers combined (OR = 3.43, p less than 0.05) and colon cancer alone (OR = 4.39, p less than 0.01).
