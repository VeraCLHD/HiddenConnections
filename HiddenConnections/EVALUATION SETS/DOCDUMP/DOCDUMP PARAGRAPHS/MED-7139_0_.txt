Abstract Limonoids are a prominent group of secondary metabolites in citrus fruit. The bitter character of some compounds in this group has historically compromised the quality of citrus fruit and juice. Detecting bitter limonoids in citrus, understanding their origins, and developing methods for their removal from citrus juices have provided the basis for citrus limonoid research.
