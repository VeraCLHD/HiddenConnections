For further clarification of these issues, we conducted a meta‐analysis of prospective studies. Methods and Results PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched, and the bibliographies of the retrieved articles were also reviewed to identify eligible studies. Summary relative risk (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed with a random‐effects model.
