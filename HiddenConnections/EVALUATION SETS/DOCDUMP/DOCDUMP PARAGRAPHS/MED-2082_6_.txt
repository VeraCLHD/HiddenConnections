Obviously, the cortical actin cytoskeleton switches from gelation to solation depending on the ambient sodium and potassium concentrations, whereas the center of the cell is not involved. Such a mechanism would control endothelial deformability and nitric oxide release, and thus influence systemic blood pressure.
