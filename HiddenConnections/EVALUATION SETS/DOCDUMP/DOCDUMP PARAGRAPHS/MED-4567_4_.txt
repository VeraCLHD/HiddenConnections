Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic variables and major recognized risk factors for pancreatic cancer were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of pancreatic cancer for each dietary pattern. RESULTS: We identified four dietary patterns-named "animal products," "unsaturated fats," "vitamins and fiber," and "starch rich," that explain 75% of the total variance in nutrient intake in this population. After allowing for all the four patterns, positive associations were found for the animal products and the starch rich patterns, the OR for the highest versus the lowest quartiles being 2.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-3.19) and 1.69 (95% CI, 1.02-2.79), respectively; an inverse association emerged for the vitamins and fiber pattern (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.86), whereas no association was observed for the unsaturated fats pattern (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.71-1.78).
