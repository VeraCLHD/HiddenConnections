Further investigation found that dextran-coated charcoal suppressed the stimulating effect of the sera on MCF-7 cell growth. The mechanisms involved in the MCF-7 cell proliferation stimulated by zeranol-containing sera may include up-regulation of cyclin D1 and down-regulation of p53 and p21 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in the cells. The results suggest that the consumption of beef products containing biologically active residues of zeranol or its metabolites is a risk linked to breast cancer development.
