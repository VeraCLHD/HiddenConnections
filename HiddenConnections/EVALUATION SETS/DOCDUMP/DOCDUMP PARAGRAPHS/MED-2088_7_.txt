AI was significantly increased following the high sodium meal (p = 0.02) but there was no effect on BP. CONCLUSIONS: A meal containing 65 mmol Na increases serum sodium and arterial stiffness but does not alter postprandial nitrate/nitrite concentration in healthy normotensive individuals. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism by which salt affects vascular function in the postprandial period.
