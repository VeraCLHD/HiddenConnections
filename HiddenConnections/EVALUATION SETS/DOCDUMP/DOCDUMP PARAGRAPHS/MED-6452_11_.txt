Formation of an IC with hydrophobic carrier, TA-β-CD, provided better in vitro/in vivo sustained release of FBR anthocyanins (16–24 and 97–99% CG + CR release, respectively, after 1 and 28 days from 20 wt% RE:TA-β-CD IC/PLA implants) over 1 month, owing to reduced polymer water uptake and porosity. Conclusion PLA injectable millicylindrical implants loaded with RE:TA-β-CD IC are optimal dosage forms for 1-month slow and continuous delivery of chemopreventive FBR anthocyanins.
