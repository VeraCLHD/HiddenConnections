Controlled dietary trials were undertaken to determine the dietary basis for the differences in BP between vegetarians and nonvegetarians. Exchanging meat and eggs for vegetable products; increasing total dietary protein or replacing soy protein with dairy protein; exchanging saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids; and changing the content of total dietary fat and carbohydrate all had no substantial effect on BP. Therefore, animal products, carbohydrate, and different types of fats do not appear to explain the low BP in vegetarians.
