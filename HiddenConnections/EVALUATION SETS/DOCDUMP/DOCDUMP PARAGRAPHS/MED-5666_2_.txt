Protein and zinc concentrations in breast-milk from macrobiotic mothers decreased with stage of lactation. After adjustment for stage of lactation, milk from macrobiotic mothers contained less calcium, magnesium and saturated fatty acids C15:0-C20:0, and more polyunsaturated fatty acids. Observed tendencies for lower protein and fat and higher lactose concentrations in the macrobiotic group were not statistically significant.
