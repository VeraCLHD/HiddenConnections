The total concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower in Greenland Eskimos than in the other groups. These findings are discussed in the light of the generally accepted opinion of the beneficial effect on plasma lipid levels and on the morbidity of coronary atherosclerosis of a high dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. As plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in Greenland Eskimos in a previous study were found markedly lower than those found in Western populations, and as coronary atherosclerosis seems to occur far less commonly among Eskimos in Greenland than among peoples in industrialized countries, it was found difficult to combine these observations with the results from the present study.
