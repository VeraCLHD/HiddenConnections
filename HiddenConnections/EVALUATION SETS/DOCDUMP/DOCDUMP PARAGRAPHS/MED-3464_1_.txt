Methods We followed 79,120 women from 1980 and 42,052 men from 1986 to 2004 who were 40+ years old, did not have POAG, and reported receiving eye examinations. Information on caffeine consumption, potential confounders and POAG diagnoses were repeatedly updated in validated follow-up questionnaires. We confirmed 1,011 incident POAG cases with medical record review.
