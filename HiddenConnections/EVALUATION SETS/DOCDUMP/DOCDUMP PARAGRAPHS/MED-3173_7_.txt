In five diabetic patients, selected for having a flat glucagon and GFR response to a meat meal, replacement of glucagon to postprandial levels increased urinary vasodilatory prostaglandins and restored a normal GFR response. Thus in normal subjects renal vasodilatory prostaglandins appear to be the final effector of the renal hemodynamic and albuminuric response to a meat meal. The prostaglandin increase is likely to be mediated under physiological conditions by a glucagon rise, which, however, has no effect per se on renal hemodynamics.
