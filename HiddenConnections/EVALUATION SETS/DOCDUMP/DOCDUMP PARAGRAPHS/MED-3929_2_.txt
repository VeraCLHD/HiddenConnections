All other macronutrients were kept constant. During the high-RS diet daily excretion of fecal nitrogen increased from 1.84 +/- 0.15 to 2.86 +/- 0.42 g/d (P < 0.01) and excretion of fecal phenols fell from 9.2 +/- 1.4 to 5.3 +/- 0.8 mg/d (P < 0.01). Fecal concentrations of ammonia decreased from 397 +/- 33 to 278 +/- 49 microgram/g (P < 0.01) and phenols decreased from 69 +/- 8 to 39 +/- 10 microgram/g (P < 0.001).
