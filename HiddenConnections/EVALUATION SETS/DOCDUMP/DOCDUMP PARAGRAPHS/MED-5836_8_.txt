Also, 20% of the examined milk powder samples exceeded the PAPLs (0.01 to 0.4 mg/kg). The MEDI for Al in bulk farm milk, control market milk, market milk boiled in Al cookware, market milk boiled in stainless-steel cookware, processed cheese wrapped in Al foil, processed cheese packed in glass containers, and milk powder were calculated as 3.0%, 61.0%, 63.0%, 61.0%, 428.0%, 220.0%, and 166.0% from "PTDI," respectively. The results of the experimental study showed no marked significant differences of Al concentration between market milk (control group) and those boiled in Al cookware, as well as to those boiled in stainless-steel cookware.
