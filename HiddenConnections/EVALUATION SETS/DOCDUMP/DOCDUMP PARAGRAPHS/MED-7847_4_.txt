RESULTS: We found that the sneezing score significantly decreased in the TE group at the end of the trial compared to the beginning (P < 0.05). There were decreasing tendencies of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction in the TE group. The patients' quality of life was significantly improved in the TE group after 8 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05), but not in placebo group.
