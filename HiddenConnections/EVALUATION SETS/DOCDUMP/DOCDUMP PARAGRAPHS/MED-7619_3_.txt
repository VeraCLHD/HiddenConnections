METHODS: A questionnaire about self-experienced adverse reaction to food was sent to 347 RA patients. Rectal challenge with CM and gluten was performed in 27 of these patients and in healthy controls (n = 18). After a 15-h challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the mucosal release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured by using the mucosal patch technique.
