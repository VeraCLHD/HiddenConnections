Unrefined sweeteners were hypothesized to contain higher levels of antioxidants, similar to the contrast between whole and refined grain products. OBJECTIVE: To compare the total antioxidant content of natural sweeteners as alternatives to refined sugar. DESIGN: The ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay was used to estimate total antioxidant capacity.
