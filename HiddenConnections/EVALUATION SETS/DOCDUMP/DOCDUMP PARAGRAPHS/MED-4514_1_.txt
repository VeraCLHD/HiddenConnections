The theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) of oestradiol-17beta by consumption of cattle meat is calculated to be 4.3 ng. Following the use of oestradiol-containing growth-promoting agents, TMDI is increased by a factor of 4.6 to 20 ng oestradiol-17beta, assuming that single dosage and 'good animal husbandry' are observed. Pork and poultry probably contain similar amounts of oestrogens as untreated cattle.
