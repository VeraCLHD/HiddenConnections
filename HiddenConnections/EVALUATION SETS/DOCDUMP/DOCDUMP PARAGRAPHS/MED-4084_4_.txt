Current diet, weight, smoking, physical activity, medication use, and other risk factors for hip fractures were reported on biennial questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate relative risks (RR) of first incident hip fracture from low-trauma events per glass (8 fl oz or 240 mL) of milk consumed per day during teenage years. Results Over follow-up, 1226 hip fractures were identified in women and 490 in men.
