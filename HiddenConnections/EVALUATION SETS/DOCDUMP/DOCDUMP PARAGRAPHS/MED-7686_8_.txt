Undiagnosed CD was found in 68 (0.9%) persons with similar age at sampling and 46 (0.8%) persons with similar years of birth. The rate of undiagnosed CD was 4.5-fold and 4-fold greater in the recent cohorts (respectively) than in the Air Force cohort (both P â‰¤ .0001). Conclusions During 45 years of follow-up, undiagnosed CD was associated with a nearly 4-fold increased risk of death.
