Many HAAs are carcinogenic and induce tumors at multiple sites in rodents. A number of epidemiologic studies have reported that frequent consumption of well-done cooked meats containing HAAs can result in elevated risks for colon, prostate, and mammary cancers. Moreover, DNA adducts of HAAs have been detected in human tissues, demonstrating that HAAs induce genetic damage even though the concentrations of these compounds in cooked meats are generally in the low parts-per-billion (ppb) range.
