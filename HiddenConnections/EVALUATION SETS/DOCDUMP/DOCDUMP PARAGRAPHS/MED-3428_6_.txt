Posm was also higher in DE than CON when using composite DE assessments, including Tosm and DEQ-5 (P = 0.021, d = 1.07); Tosm and NITBUT (P = 0.013, d = 1.08); and the VAS and DEQ-5 (P = 0.034, d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: These are the first published data to show that individuals classified as DE have higher Posm, indicating suboptimal hydration, compared with non-DE. These findings indicate that whole-body hydration is an important consideration in DE.
