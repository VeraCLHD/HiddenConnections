OCs were detected in 95% of umbilical cord blood samples from the 318 mothers, who had a mean degree of adherence to the MD of 56.77 (SD: 16.35) (range, 0-100). The MD prioritizes consumption of vegetable and fruit over meat and dairy products, and OCs are generally lipophilic molecules that accumulate in foods of animal origin. Consumption of meat, fish, and dairy products was associated with dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in umbilical cord serum, and dairy product intake with lindane.
