Refrigeration of pork muscle infested with cysticerci at temperatures above 0 degrees C did not affect the parasites' survival in culture. Conversely, freezing of meat prevented survival of cysts. A practical procedure to kill cysticerci is the storage of pork muscle for four days at -5 degrees C, three days at -15 degrees C, or one day at -24 degrees C.
