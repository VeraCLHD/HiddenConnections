OBJECTIVE: Emergency department data from NEISS were analyzed to assess the magnitude and severity of adverse events attributable to food allergies. METHODS: Emergency department events describing food-related allergic symptomatology were identified from 34 participating EDs from August 1 to September 30, 2003. RESULTS: Extrapolation of NEISS event data predicts a total of 20,821 hospital ED visits, 2333 visits for anaphylaxis, and 520 hospitalizations caused by food allergy in the United States during the 2-month study period.
