After adjustment for renal function, diabetes, diuretic use, hypertension, race, body mass index, income, and education level, the highest BLL quartile was associated with a 3.6-fold higher risk for gout and a 1.9-fold higher risk for hyperuricemia compared with the lowest quartile. LIMITATION: Blood lead level does not necessarily reflect the total body lead burden. CONCLUSION: Blood lead levels in the range currently considered acceptable are associated with increased prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia.
