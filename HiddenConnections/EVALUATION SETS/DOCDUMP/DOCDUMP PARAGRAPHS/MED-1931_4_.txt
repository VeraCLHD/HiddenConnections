METHODS: We investigated the association between fat-free mass (FFM), percentage FFM (FFM%) and fat-free mass index (FFMI, weight/height²), measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 2,689 women aged 18-79 years from the TwinsUK Study, and dietary acid-base load. Body composition was calculated according to quartile of potential renal acid load and adjusted for age, physical activity, misreporting and smoking habit (FFM, FFMI also for fat mass) and additionally with percentage protein. RESULTS: Fat-free mass was positively associated with a more alkalinogenic dietary load (comparing quartile 1 vs 4: FFM 0.79 kg P < 0.001, FFM% 1.06 % <0.001, FFMI 0.24 kg/m² P = 0.002), and with the ratio of fruits and vegetables to potential acidogenic foods.
