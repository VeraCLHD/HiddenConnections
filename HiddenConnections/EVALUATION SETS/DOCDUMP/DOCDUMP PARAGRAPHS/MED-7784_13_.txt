CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in a local population, impairment of endothelial function is a possible mechanism in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis from HF intake, beyond just affecting lipid levels. This effect is observed after both a LHF and a WHF meal intake. This technique to study endothelial function may be a useful non-invasive screening tool in the study of other HF diet choices and provides further information for the education of the influence of dietary choices on atherosclerosis.
