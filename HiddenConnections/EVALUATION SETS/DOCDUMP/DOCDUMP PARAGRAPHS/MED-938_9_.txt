We found no association between fish consumption and SI (multivariable-adjusted β= −0.015 [−0.083, 0.053]) or fasting insulin (multivariable-adjusted β=0.016 [−0.066, 0.10]). Conclusions Fish consumption was not associated with measures of insulin sensitivity in the multi-ethnic IRAS cohort. However, higher fish consumption may be associated with pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.
