The aim was to evaluate the effect of alpha-galactosidase administration, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled protocol, on intestinal gas production and gas-related symptoms after a challenge test meal in healthy volunteers. Eight healthy volunteers ingested 300 or 1200 GalU of alpha-galactosidase or placebo during a test meal containing 420 g of cooked beans. Breath hydrogen excretion and occurrence of bloating, abdominal pain, discomfort, flatulence, and diarrhea were measured for 8 hr.
