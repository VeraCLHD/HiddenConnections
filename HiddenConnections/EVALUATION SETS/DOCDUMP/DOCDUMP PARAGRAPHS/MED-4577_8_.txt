A good correlation between plasma and urine values was found. Total concentrations of individual compounds vary greatly between the subjects (from pmol/l to mumol/l), the vegetarians having higher values, particularly one vegan subject. The highest total enterolactone concentration value exceeded 1 mumol/l.
