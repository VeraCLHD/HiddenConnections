No significant side effects were associated with peppermint oil, whereas hyoscine-N-butylbromide injection produced side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention. CONCLUSIONS: Peppermint oil solution administered intraluminally can be used as an antispasmodic agent with superior efficacy and fewer side effects than hyoscine-N-butylbromide administered by intramuscular injection during upper endoscopy.
