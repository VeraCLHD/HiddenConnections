To test these transformations, four fecal samples were incubated with xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol (IX), and 8-PN. Upon incubation with IX, present in strong ales up to 4 mg/L, 36% was converted into 8-PN in one fecal sample and the estrogenic properties of the sample drastically increased. In an experiment with 12 fecal cultures, this conversion was observed in one-third of the samples, indicating the importance of interindividual variability in the intestinal microbial community.
