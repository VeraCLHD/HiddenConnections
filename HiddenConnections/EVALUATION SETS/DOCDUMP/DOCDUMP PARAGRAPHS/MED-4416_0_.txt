Abstract The effect of polyphenols, phenolic acids and tannins (PPTs) from strawberry and apple on uptake and apical to basolateral transport of glucose was investigated using Caco-2 intestinal cell monolayers. Substantial inhibition on both uptake and transport was observed by extracts from both strawberry and apple. Using sodium-containing (glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 both active) and sodium-free (only GLUT2 active) conditions, we show that the inhibition of GLUT2 was greater than that of SGLT1.
