SUMMARY: The PASCAL is now being substituted for the conventional argon laser for PRP in many clinics. Ophthalmologists should keep in mind that adjusting the PASCAL settings (including the duration, number, and size of laser burns) might become necessary to maintain regression and eliminate recurrence of neovascularization in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Further studies are needed to determine the parameters for optimal safety and efficacy on the PASCAL.
