A high serum concentration of calcidiol at the time of diagnosis, i.e. at the start of conventional therapy, seems to give an increased survival rate. This agrees with cell and animal experiments reported in the literature, as well as with epidemiological data from some countries relating colon cancer survival with latitude and vitamin D3 synthesis in skin. One possible interpretation of the present data is that, the level of calcidiol, or its derivative calcitriol (1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1alpha,25-(OH)2D3), may act positively in concert with conventional therapies of colon cancer.
