Systemic blood pressure, pulse rates, intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular blood circulation by laser-speckle flowgraphy, and Humphrey visual field mean deviation (MD) were measured during the 24-month period. RESULTS: As a main outcome measurement, we evaluated the difference between the groups in MD deterioration in the eye with a better MD from the trial's baseline through 24 months. A statistically significant difference was observed between the treatment groups in mean change from baseline in MD 24 months after therapy (p = 0.039, unpaired t test).
