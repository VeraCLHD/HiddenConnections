Sex and apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE) affect cognition and may modulate the response to DHA supplementation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether a DHA supplement improves cognitive performance in healthy young adults and whether sex and APOE modulate the response. DESIGN: Healthy adults (n = 176; age range: 18-45 y; nonsmoking and with a low intake of DHA) completed a 6-mo randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention in which they consumed 1.16 g DHA/d or a placebo.
