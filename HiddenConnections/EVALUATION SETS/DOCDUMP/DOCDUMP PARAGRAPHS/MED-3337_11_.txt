CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study some fruit smoothies have the potential to bring about dental erosion if consumed irresponsibly. This can be influenced by ingredient variations. In order to minimise the risk of developing dental erosion, without removing the claimed nutritional benefits of their consumption, their consumption should be confined to mealtimes.
