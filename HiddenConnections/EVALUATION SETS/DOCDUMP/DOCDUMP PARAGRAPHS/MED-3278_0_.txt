Abstract Objective Although it is now accepted that asymptomatic cerebral infarcts are an important cause of dementia in the elderly, the relationship between atherosclerosis per se and dementia is controversial. Specifically, it is unclear whether atherosclerosis can cause the neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that define Alzheimer neuropathology and whether atherosclerosis, a potentially reversible risk factor, can influence cognition independent of brain infarcts. Methods We examined the relationship between systemic atherosclerosis, Alzheimer type pathology and dementia in autopsies from 200 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a prospective study of the effect of aging on cognition, 175 of whom had complete body autopsies.
