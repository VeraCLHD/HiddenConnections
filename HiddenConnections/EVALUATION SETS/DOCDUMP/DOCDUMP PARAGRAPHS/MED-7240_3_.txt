Further studies showed that amines (TMAO) normally present in fish, can react with sodium nitrite used as preservative, or nitrogen oxides from the combustion of fuel oils used during processing, to produce the toxic agent, NDMA. Mink and fox may consume considerable amounts of fish meal in their diets. If the fish meal contains sufficient NDMA, the incidence of liver failure or tumours can be quite high.
