The difference detected by a chi-squared test was significant for all events studied; nausea and vomiting (P < 0.0001), rash (P < 0.02), and total complaints (P < 0.0001). The altered multivitamins contained added citrus bioflavanoids not included in the original formula. Citrus bioflavanoids decrease the clearance of exogenous estrogens by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.
