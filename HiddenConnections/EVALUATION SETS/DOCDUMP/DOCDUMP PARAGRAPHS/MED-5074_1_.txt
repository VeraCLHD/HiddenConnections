This review first briefly summarizes the data delineating mortality trajectories of various species' populations maintained on restricted diets to provide insight into the effects of nutrient deprivation on distinct components of the aging process. Next, I discuss a number of important studies that have addressed the question whether it is the lack of calories and/or specific nutrients that determines the longevity response to dietary restriction. Finally, I review the evidence for hormesis as a proximate mechanism underpinning the impact of dietary restriction on lifespan.
