We found a useful effect of a DRIF on plasma L-dopa concentration and motor function. The greatest effect on the plasma L-dopa levels was found early (at 30 and 60 min) after oral administration. There was a relationship between the improvement of constipation and the higher bioavailability of L-dopa.
