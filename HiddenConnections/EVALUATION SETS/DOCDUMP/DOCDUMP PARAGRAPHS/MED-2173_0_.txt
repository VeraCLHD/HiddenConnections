Abstract PURPOSE: While exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a recognized risk factor for cataract, its association is more controversial with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We report the associations of lifetime exposure to ambient UVR with cataract extraction and AMD. METHODS: The Alienor Study is a population-based study of 963 residents of Bordeaux (France), aged 73 years or more.
