When data were stratified by 5-year age group, lower IPD incidence in smokers was observed at all ages between 50 and 90 years. Age-specific mortality trends for smokers and nonsmokers with and without IPD suggested that increased mortality in IPD patients was mostly associated with IPD itself and not with smoking. The slight excess mortality in smokers without IPD, versus nonsmokers without IPD, appeared insufficient to account for the "missing" incident IPD cases in smokers.
