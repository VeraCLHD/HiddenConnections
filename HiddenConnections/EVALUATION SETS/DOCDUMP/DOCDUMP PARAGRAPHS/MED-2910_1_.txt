The scientific evidence for this is weak and rests on early clinical evidence and uncertain mortality statistics. METHODS: We reviewed the literature and performed new analyses of the mortality statistics from Greenland, Canada, and Alaska. FINDINGS: The evidence for a low mortality from IHD among the Inuit is fragile and rests on unreliable mortality statistics.
