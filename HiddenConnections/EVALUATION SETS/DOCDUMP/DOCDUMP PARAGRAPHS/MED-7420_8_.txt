There were no between-group differences in urinary perchlorate concentrations (P = 0.75), TSH (P = 0.46), and free T4 (P = 0.77). Urinary iodine, perchlorate, and thiocyanate levels were not associated with TSH (P = 0.59) or free T4 (P = 0.14), even when adjusted for multiple variables. Conclusions: U.S. vegetarians are iodine sufficient.
