The significant association of these two patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia persisted after further adjusting for blood lipids. On the other hand, the "western" pattern was not associated with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. We observed a positive relationship between the "animal products and fried food" pattern and asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and a negative relationship between the "soybean products and fruit" pattern and asymptomatic hyperuricemia, independent of blood lipids.
