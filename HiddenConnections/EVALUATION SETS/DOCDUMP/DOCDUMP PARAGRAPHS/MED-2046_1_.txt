METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over 12 weeks with 67 menopausal women, who were administered a hop extract standardized on 8-PN (100 or 250 microg). The responses were determined by means of a modified Kupperman index (KI) and a patients' questionnaire. RESULTS: All groups, including placebo, showed a significant reduction of the KI both after 6 weeks and after 12 weeks.
