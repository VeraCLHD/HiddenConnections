In addition, it has a striking effect on DNA repair, measured in different ways. Incubation of H(2)O(2)-treated cells with beta-cryptoxanthin led to a doubling of the rate of rejoining of strand breaks and had a similar effect on the rate of removal of oxidized purines by base excision repair. The latter effect was confirmed with an in vitro assay: cells were incubated with or without beta-cryptoxanthin before preparing an extract, which was then incubated with substrate DNA containing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine; incision was more rapid with the extract prepared from carotenoid-preincubated cells.
