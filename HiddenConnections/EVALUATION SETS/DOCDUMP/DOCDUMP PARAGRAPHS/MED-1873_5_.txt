Furthermore, an examination of other carboxylic acids for induction of apoptosis revealed a rank order that corresponded to the order of potency in causing hyperacetylation of core histones. Specifically, the active acids were 3-5 carbons in length and lacked substitution at the 2-position. Isovaleric and propionic acids, in particular, proved to be effective inducers of both hyperacetylation and apoptosis at 5 mM concentrations, a finding of potential relevance to the unusual pancytopenia occurring after acidotic episodes in isovaleric and propionic acidemias.
