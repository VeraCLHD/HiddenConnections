Daily multivitamin use was associated with a reduction in total cancer among 1,312 men with a baseline history of cancer (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56–0.96; P=0.022), but this did not differ significantly from that among 13,329 men initially free of cancer (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.02; P=0.15) (P, interaction = 0.07). Conclusions In this large prevention trial of male physicians, daily multivitamin supplementation modestly but significantly reduced the risk of total cancer.
