METHODS: Forty-five women were randomly assigned to four interventions: "placebo ingestion" (n = 11), "curcumin ingestion" (n = 11), "exercise training with placebo ingestion" (n = 11), or "exercise training with curcumin ingestion" (n = 12). Curcumin or placebo pills (150 mg/day) were administered for 8 weeks. Aortic blood pressure (BP) and augmentation index (AIx), an index of LV afterload, were evaluated by pulse wave analysis from tonometrically measured radial arterial pressure waveforms.
