OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to estimate usual intakes of nine individual phytonutrients by Americans consuming recommended levels of fruits and vegetables compared to intakes by adults not meeting these recommendations, and to identify contributions of food sources to total phytonutrient intakes. The phytonutrients examined in this study are found predominantly in fruits and vegetables. DESIGN: Food consumption data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003-2006 and phytonutrient concentration data from US Department of Agriculture databases and the published literature were used to estimate energy-adjusted usual intakes.
