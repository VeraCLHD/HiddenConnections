Persistence of microalbuminuria (>30 mg/g) was estimated from repeat visit data in NHANES 1988-1994. The GFR was estimated using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation reexpressed to standard serum creatinine. RESULTS: The prevalence of both albuminuria and decreased GFR increased from 1988-1994 to 1999-2004.
