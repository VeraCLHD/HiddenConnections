anti-H-10 and anti-H-11 showed about 9% enantiomeric cross-reactivity, and anti-H-11 did not discriminate between isoxanthohumol (IX) and 8-PN (84% cross-reactivity). For anti-H-10, cross-reactivities in the range of 2-5% were found for xanthohumol, IX, and 6-prenylnaringenin. Respective numbers for anti-H-25 were 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2%.
