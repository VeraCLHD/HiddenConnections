We hypothesize that IP6 decreases cell adhesion by suppressing the integrin receptors and their subsequent signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed integrin expressions of the highly invasive estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer MDA-MB 231 cells exposed to IP6 by flow cytometry. The expression of focal adhesion proteins was investigated by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting.
