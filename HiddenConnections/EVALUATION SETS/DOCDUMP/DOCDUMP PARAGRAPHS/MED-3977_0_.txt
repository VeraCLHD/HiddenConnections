Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fiber intake is associated with reduced stroke risk in prospective studies, but no meta-analysis has been published to date. METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were searched for healthy participant studies reporting fiber intake and incidence of first hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, published between January 1990 and May 2012. RESULTS: Eight cohort studies from the United States, northern Europe, Australia, and Japan met inclusion criteria.
