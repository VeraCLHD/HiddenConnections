Mestranol was also activated by microsomes induced with saline (control), beta-napthoflavone, 3-methylcholantherene, isoniazid or pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile, but not phenobarbitone. These studies demonstrate the principle for use of a binary assay system for the detection of pro-oestrogens and indicate the potential value for risk assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals.
