Despite long days caring for patients, Maimonides wrote extensively about both medicine and philosophy. His medical works span all topics of clinical medicine and reflect rational thinking and an understanding of the relationship between mind and body. Well known for his philosophical writings, such as The Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides codified Jewish law and revolutionized Jewish thinking.
