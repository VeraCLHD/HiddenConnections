Multivariate linear regressions using SUDAAN were conducted to obtain means of FVC and its components by Hispanic subgroups controlling for confounders. Results Hispanic subgroups did not differ in their intake of total FVC (mean cups = 3.4 and 2.9 for men and women, respectively). Small but significant differences (p<0.01) were found across Hispanic subgroups in individual FVC components (green salad (women only), cooked dried beans and non-fried white potatoes) after adjusting for potential sociodemographic and acculturation confounders.
