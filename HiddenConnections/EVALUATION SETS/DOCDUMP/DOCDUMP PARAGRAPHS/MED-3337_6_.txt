Only two drinks (Volvic(â„¢) still mineral water, the negative control, and the yoghurt, vanilla bean and honey 'thickie') displayed a higher pH, though to neutralise the thickie, a lesser quantity of alkali addition was required. The immersion of the tooth samples in the drinks brought about reductions in their surface hardness (expressed as a percentage change of median hardness) but these were only significant (p <0.001) for the cranberry, blueberry and cherry fruit smoothie and homemade strawberry and banana fruit smoothie. There was no reduction in surface hardness in the case of the teeth immersed in the thickie.
