BRCA1 protein-negative tumours were more frequently basal marker-positive and ER-negative, highlighting the 'BRCAness' of sporadic breast cancer with loss of BRCA1 protein expression through promoter hypermethylation similar to hereditary breast cancer with BRCA1 mutations. Loss of BRCA1 in sporadic breast cancer suggests that therapeutics targeting BRCA1 pathway in hereditary breast cancer like PARP inhibitors might be used as therapeutic targets for sporadic breast tumours.
