However, they also consumed more (P < 0.05) calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, and fiber intake was the same. Breath hydrogen was higher (P < 0.0001) and methane lower in AAs, and fecal colony counts of 7-alpha dehydroxylating bacteria were higher and of Lactobacilli were lower. Colonic crypt cell proliferation rates were dramatically higher in AAs (21.8 +/- 1.1% vs. 3.2 +/- 0.8% labeling, P < 0.0001).
