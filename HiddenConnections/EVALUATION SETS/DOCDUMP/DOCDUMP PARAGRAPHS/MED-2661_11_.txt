Two Phase III studies were performed in seropositive SLE patients. In a Phase III, 52-week study, the rates of response (a reduction of â‰¥4 points on the SLE Response Index [SRI]) at week 52 were 51% and 58% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose, respectively, versus 44% with placebo (both, P < 0.05). In a Phase III, 76-week study, the rates of response, as measured using SRI, at week 52 were 42.8% and 46.5% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 35.3% with placebo (P = NS and P < 0.001); at 76 weeks, response rates were 42.1% and 41.4% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 33.8% with placebo (P < 0.05 and P = NS).
