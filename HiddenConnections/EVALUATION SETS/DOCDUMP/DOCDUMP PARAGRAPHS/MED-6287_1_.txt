Accordingly, herein, we investigated the antiangiogenic efficacy and associated mechanisms of fisetin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Fisetin (10-50 Î¼M) strongly inhibited the regular serum plus growth supplement- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced growth (up to 92%, P < 0.001) and survival (up to 16%, P < 0.001) of HUVEC in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Fisetin also caused cell cycle arrest at G(1) (strong) and G(2)/M (moderate) phases together with a decrease in cyclin D1 and an increase in p53 levels.
