Abstract BACKGROUND: Efficacy of burping in lowering colic and regurgitation episodes in healthy term babies lacks evidence in literature. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare efficacy of burping versus no-burping in 71 mother-baby dyads in community setting. Primary outcome was reduction in event rates of colic and regurgitation episodes over 3 months.
