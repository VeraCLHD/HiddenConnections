The use of urinary concentrations from biomonitoring studies was evaluated and the back-calculation of BPA intake seems reliable for the overall exposure assessment. In general, the total exposure to BPA is several orders of magnitude lower than the current tolerable daily intake of 50 Î¼g/kg bw/day. Finally, the paper concludes with some critical remarks and recommendations on future human exposure studies to BPA.
