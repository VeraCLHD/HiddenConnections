Measurements of enamel loss were made by surface profilometry and microhardness. RESULTS: Diet Coke was found to be the most acidic drink (pH 2.61), whereas Innocent(®) mangoes and passion fruit smoothie showed to be the least (pH 3.9). With regard to TA, Innocent(®) blackberries, strawberries, and blackcurrant smoothie had the highest TA requiring 10.8 mol of NaOH to reach pH 7.0, whereas citric acid required only 3.1 mol of NaOH to reach the same pH value.
