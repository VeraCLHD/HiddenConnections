Flavonoid intake was assessed using an updated food composition database and a validated food frequency questionnaire. Results: We identified 805 participants (438 men and 367 women) who developed PD during 20â€“22 years of follow-up. In men, after adjusting for multiple confounders, participants in the highest quintile of total flavonoids had a 40%lower PD risk than those in the lowest quintile (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.43, 0.83; p trend = 0.001).
