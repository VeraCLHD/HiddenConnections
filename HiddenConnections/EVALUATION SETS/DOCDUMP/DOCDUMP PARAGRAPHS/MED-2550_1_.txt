Methods Within a case-control study we assessed the association between Parkinson disease and living or working with active smokers. Cases were newly diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease (N=154) from western Washington State in 2002â€“2008. Age- and sex-matched controls (N=173) were neurologically normal and unrelated to cases.
