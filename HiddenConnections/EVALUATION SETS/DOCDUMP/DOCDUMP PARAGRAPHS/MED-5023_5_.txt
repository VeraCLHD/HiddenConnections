We estimated the risk of recurrent gout attacks related to cherry intake using conditional logistic regression. Results Our study included 633 individuals with gout. Cherry intake over a 2-day period was associated with a 35% lower risk of gout attacks compared with no intake (multivariate odds ratio [OR] = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85).
