Digestive stability averaged over 80%, except for the xanthophylls, which exhibited a wider and lower range of stabilities. CONCLUSION: These data identify raw food sources for carotenoid bioaccessibilities comparable to those of other foods accomplished by substantial processing. The information presented here also has application in identifying appropriate plant-breeding goals and optimal sources for commercial carotenoid isolations.
