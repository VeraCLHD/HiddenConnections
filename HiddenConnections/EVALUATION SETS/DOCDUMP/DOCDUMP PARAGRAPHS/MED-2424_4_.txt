Regular consumption of oranges/bananas (odds ratio = 0.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.94) and orange juice (odds ratio = 0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.94) during the first 2 years of life was associated with a reduction in risk of childhood leukemia diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 14 years. Restricting the analysis to leukemia diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 5 years reflected a similar pattern of reduced risk. No association between eating hot dogs/lunch meats and risk of leukemia was found.
