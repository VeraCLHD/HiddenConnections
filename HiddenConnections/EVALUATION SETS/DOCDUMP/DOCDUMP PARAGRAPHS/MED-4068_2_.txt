Blood glucose and insulin responses were measured for 4 h after the test meal. When carbohydrate was given alone, the blood glucose and serum insulin increments were higher for the potato meal. The addition of protein increased the insulin responses to both carbohydrates and slightly reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato (F = 2.04, p less than 0.05).
