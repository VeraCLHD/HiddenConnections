Plasma TAS, TOS levels were determined by using a novel automated methods. Plasma TOS and OSI value were significantly higher, and plasma TAS level was lower in patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.001 for all). There was a significant negative correlation between OSI and BMD in lumbar and femoral neck region (r = -0.63, P < 0.001; r = 0.40, P = 0.018).
