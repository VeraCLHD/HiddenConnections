The purpose of this review is to highlight an important role for L-arginine in regulating BAT growth and development, thereby reducing obesity in mammals. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary supplementation with L-arginine reduces white adipose tissue in genetically or diet-induced obese rats, obese pregnant sheep, and obese humans with type II diabetes. L-arginine treatment enhances BAT growth in both fetuses and postnatal animals.
