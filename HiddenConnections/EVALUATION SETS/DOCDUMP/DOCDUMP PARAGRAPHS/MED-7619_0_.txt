Abstract OBJECTIVES: A dietary link to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been suspected and an influence on arthritic symptoms by different diets has been reported. Our primary aim was to record the self-experienced adverse food reactions in patients with RA. A secondary aim was to relate self-experienced adverse reactions to dairy produce and wheat to the local mucosal reactivity observed after rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) and wheat gluten.
