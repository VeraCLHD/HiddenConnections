RESULTS: We identified 135 potentially relevant records; only 6 studies met the final criteria. Of the total 508 subjects, 256 and 252 subjects were randomly assigned to receive ginger and placebo, respectively. The use of ginger (âˆ¼1 g daily) for at least 4 days is associated with a 5-fold likelihood of improvement in NVEP.
