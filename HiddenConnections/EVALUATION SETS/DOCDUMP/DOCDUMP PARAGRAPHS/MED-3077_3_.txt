METHODS We examined data from a nationally representative sample of 1266 physicians in the U.S. surveyed in 2007. The survey included questions about physician and practice characteristics, perceptions about screening, and recommendations for age of initiation and screening interval for FOBT, FS, colonoscopy and DCBE in average risk adults. Physiciansâ€™ screening recommendations were classified as guideline consistent for all, some, or none of the CRC screening modalities recommended.
