When considering the annual incidence in 2012, lung cancer would cause the greatest subtotal of EYLL (3,116,000 years) followed by female breast cancer (1,420,000 years) and colorectal cancer (932,000 years). CONCLUSION: The potential life years saved by successful prevention, in terms of EYLL since diagnosis, would be substantial for lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. This work will inform prioritization of strategies for cancer control to minimize the life expectancy loss.
