Ergosterol (mg/100 g) was highest in maitake and shiitake (79.2, 84.9) and lowest in morel and enoki (26.3, 35.5); the range was <10 mg/100 g among white button composites but 12-50 mg/100 g among samples of other types. All mushrooms contained ergosta-5,7-dienol (22,23-dihydroergosterol) (3.53-18.0 mg/100 g) and (except morel) ergosta-7-enol. Only morel contained brassicasterol (28.6 mg/100 g) and campesterol (1.23-4.54 mg/100 g) and no ergosta-7,22-dienol.
