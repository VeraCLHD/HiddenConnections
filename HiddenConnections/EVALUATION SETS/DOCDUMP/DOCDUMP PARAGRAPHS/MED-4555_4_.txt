Indices of adiposity and glycemic control at baseline and at âˆ¼10 years past the baseline were compared between seropositive and seronegative subjects, with adjustment for age and sex. In addition to age and sex, indices of glycemic control were adjusted for baseline BMI and were analyzed only for nondiabetic subjects. RESULTS Seropositive subjects (14.5%) had greater adiposity at baseline, compared with seronegative subjects.
