METHODS: We evaluated whether steatosis per se is associated with hepatocytes apoptosis and determined the role of oleic and palmitic acid, the most abundant fatty acids in western diets, on triglyceride accumulation and apoptosis in an in vitro model of steatosis induced in three hepatocytic cell lines (HepG2, HuH7, WRL68). The impact of incubation for 24 h with oleic (0.66 and 1.32 mM) and palmitic acid (0.33 and 0.66 mM), alone or combined (molar ratio 2 : 1) on steatosis, apoptosis, and insulin signalling, was evaluated. RESULTS: Concurrent with PPARgamma and SREBP-1 gene activation, steatosis extent was larger when cells were treated with oleic than with palmitic acid; the latter fatty acid was associated with increased PPARalpha expression.
