Abstract AIM: The aim of the study was to determine if a high salt meal containing 65 mmol Na causes a rise in sodium concentrations and a reduction in plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations (an index of nitric oxide production). Secondary aims were to determine the effects of a high salt meal on augmentation index (AIx) a measure of arterial stiffness and markers of endothelial function. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomised cross-over study 16 healthy normotensive adults consumed a low sodium soup containing 5 mmol Na and a high sodium soup containing 65 mmol Na.
