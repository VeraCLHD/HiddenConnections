Methods We used two dietary instruments—a 24-hr food recall (24FR) and a 1-year food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)—to examine food intake among participants of the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We regressed serum concentrations of five PBDEs (BDE congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, and 153) and their sum (∑PBDE) against diet variables while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and body mass index. Results ∑PBDE serum concentrations among vegetarians were 23% (p = 0.006) and 27% (p = 0.009) lower than among omnivores for 24FR and 1-year FFQ, respectively.
