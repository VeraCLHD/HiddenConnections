After overnight fasting and discontinuation of all medications for ≥12 hours, FMD was assessed using high-resolution linear array ultrasound. Subjects were divided into 2 groups: FMD ≤11.3% (n = 309) and >11.3% (n = 309), where 11.3% is the median FMD, and were comparable regarding CV risk factors, lipoproteins, fasting glucose, C-reactive protein, concomitant medications, and Framingham 10-year risk score. In a mean clinical follow-up of 4.6 ± 1.8 years, the composite CV events (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or angina pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary interventions) were significantly more common in subjects with FMD ≤11.3% rather than >11.3% (15.2% vs 1.2%, p = 0.0001, respectively).
