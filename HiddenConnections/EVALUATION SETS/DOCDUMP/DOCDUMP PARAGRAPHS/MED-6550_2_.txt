A database was developed to estimate dietary polyamine exposure and relate exposure to health outcomes. Objective: We hypothesized that high polyamine intake would increase risk of colorectal adenoma and that the allelic variation at ODC G>A +316 would modify the association. Design: Polyamine exposure was estimated in subjects pooled (n = 1164) from the control arms of 2 randomized trials for colorectal adenoma prevention [Wheat Bran Fiber low-fiber diet arm (n = 585) and Ursodeoxycholic Acid placebo arm (n = 579)] by using baseline food-frequency questionnaire data.
