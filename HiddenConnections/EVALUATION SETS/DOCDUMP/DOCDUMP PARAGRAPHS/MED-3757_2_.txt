Most migraine drugs in use, i.e., ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, iprazochrome, pizotifen and diazepam; and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (i.e. aspirin, paracetamol, persantin, etc.) have side-effects and are prescribed with caution for a limited duration. Ginger is reported in Ayurvedic and Tibb systems of medicine to be useful in neurological disorders. It is proposed that administration of ginger may exert abortive and prophylactic effects in migraine headache without any side-effects.
