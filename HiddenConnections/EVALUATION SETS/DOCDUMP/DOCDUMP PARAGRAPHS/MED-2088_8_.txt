CONCLUSIONS: A meal containing 65 mmol Na increases serum sodium and arterial stiffness but does not alter postprandial nitrate/nitrite concentration in healthy normotensive individuals. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism by which salt affects vascular function in the postprandial period. This trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Unique Identifier: ACTRN12611000583943http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=343019.
