Cigarette smoking was marginally more common in those with severe/complete ED, as compared with those without ED. Blood pressure and fasting blood glucose were not significantly associated with ED, likely due to selective mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Improving CHD risk factors in mid-life may decrease the risk of ED as well as CHD.
