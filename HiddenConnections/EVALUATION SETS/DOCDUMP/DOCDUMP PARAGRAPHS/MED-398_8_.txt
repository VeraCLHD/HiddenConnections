Inhibition of platelet function was greatest in a subgroup with the highest plasma homocysteine (P < 0.05) and C-reactive protein concentrations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: As a functional food or dietary supplement, tomato extract may have a role in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease by reducing platelet activation, which could contribute to a reduction in thrombotic events.
