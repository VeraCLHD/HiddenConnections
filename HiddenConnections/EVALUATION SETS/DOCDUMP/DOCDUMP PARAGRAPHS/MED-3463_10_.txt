However, in patients with glaucoma or OHT, IOP increased at each measurement point, with the WMD and 95%CI being 0.347 (0.078, 0.616), 2.395 (1.741,3.049) and 1.998 (1.522,2.474) respectively. No publication bias was detected by either Begg's or Egger's test. CONCLUSION: Available evidences showed that caffeine had different effects on IOP in different groups of individuals.
