RESULTS: Eight case reports of serious PDE5 inhibitor-associated ocular complications were identified since January 2006 until February 2011. Case reports included cases of anterior and posterior nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, central retinal vein occlusion, cilio-retinal artery occlusion, acute angle closure glaucoma and optic atrophy after sildenafil use. CONCLUSION: There is lack of conclusive evidence to indicate a direct cause-effect relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and vision-threatening ocular events.
