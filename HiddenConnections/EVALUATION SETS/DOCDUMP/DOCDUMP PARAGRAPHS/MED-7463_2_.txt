Since the identification of a well-characterised functional polymorphism, Val-9Ala of MnSOD, a number of molecular epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between Val-9Ala and cancer risk. However, the results remain conflicting rather than conclusive. This meta-analysis on 15,320 cancer cases and 19,534 controls from 34 published case-control studies shows no significant overall main effect of MnSOD Val-9Ala on cancer risk.
