Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is an idiopathic disease and its pathological feature is a loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra. Some commonly used pesticides possess neurotoxicity, and exposure to such compounds may trigger mechanisms similar to those in the development of idiopathic PD. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies, aiming at a critical evaluation of the association between the development of PD and pesticide exposure.
