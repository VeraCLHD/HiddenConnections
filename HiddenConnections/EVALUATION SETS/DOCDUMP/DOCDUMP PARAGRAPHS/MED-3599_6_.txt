Dietary changes in plasma homocysteine will probably not affect the evaluation of vitamin deficiency states associated with moderate to severe hyperhomocysteinemia but may be of concern in the risk assessment of cardiovascular disease in patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia. Synchronous fluctuations in the free:bound ratio of the plasma aminothiol compounds indicate that biological effects of homocysteine may be difficult to separate from effects due to associated changes in other aminothiol compounds.
