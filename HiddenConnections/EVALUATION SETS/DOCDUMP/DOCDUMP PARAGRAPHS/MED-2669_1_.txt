A series of self-perpetuating secondary events follows an initial glomerular injury. Increased glomerular basement membrane permeability leads to loss of lipoprotein lipase activators, resulting in hyperlipidaemia. Circulating low-density lipoprotein binds with glycosaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane and increases its permeability.
