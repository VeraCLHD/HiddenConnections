Subjects were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of watermelon supplementation (L-citrulline/L arginine, 2.7 g/1.3 g/day) or placebo followed by a 4-week washout period and then crossover. RESULTS: There was a significant treatment effect (change in the value of watermelon minus placebo from baseline to 6 weeks) on bPP (-8 ± 3 mm Hg, P < 0.05), aSBP (-7 ± 2 mm Hg, P < 0.05), aPP (-6 ± 2 mm Hg, P < 0.01), AIx (-6 ± 3%, P < 0.05), AIx@75 (-4 ± 2%, P < 0.05), and P2 (-2 ± 1 mm Hg, P < 0.05). There was no significant treatment effect (P > 0.05) on bSBP, brachial diastolic BP (DBP), aortic DBP, Tr, P1, HR, and carotid-femoral PWV.
