Animal studies indicate that certain dietary fibers such as (1,3)(1,6)-beta-D-glycans (BDG) have potent effects on immune activity such as increasing the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and reducing the secretion of inflammatory factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that BDG consumption improves inflammatory markers and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese subjects with moderately increased levels of C-reactive protein, indicating subclinical inflammation. We screened 180 overweight and obese subjects for moderately increased C-reactive protein levels on 2 or more occasions, in the absence of any signs of acute infection.
