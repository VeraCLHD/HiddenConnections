Iron is present in the human diet in number of different forms, including heme (from meat) and a variety of non-heme iron compounds. While heme is absorbed intact, the bioavailability of non-heme iron varies greatly depending on dietary composition. A number of dietary components are capable of interacting with iron to regulate its solubility and oxidation state.
