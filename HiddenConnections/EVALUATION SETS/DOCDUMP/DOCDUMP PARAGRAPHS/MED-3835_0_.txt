Abstract Background: Although diet has been associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), the role of dietary components (total energy, macro and micronutrients) is unknown. We examined associations of GORD symptoms with intakes of specific dietary components. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in a sample of employees (non-patients) at the Houston VAMC.
