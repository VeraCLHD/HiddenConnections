DESIGN: Twenty-four healthy, overweight men (age 50-65 y) were included in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Throughout the three 4-wk periods, volunteers daily consumed 500 mL orange juice, 500 mL control drink plus hesperidin (CDH), or 500 mL control drink plus placebo (CDP). All measurements and blood collections were performed in overnight-fasted subjects before and after the 4-wk treatment periods.
