Platelet function is a critical factor in arterial thrombosis and the effect strawberries have is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically examine the action of strawberries in preventing platelet activation and thrombus formation. Strawberry extract concentration-dependently (0.1-1â€‰mg/ml) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP and arachidonic acid.
