The high Ca diet significantly reduced total cholesterol 6% (5.99 to 5.66 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol 11% (4.13 to 3.67 mmol/L), and apolipoprotein B concentrations 7% when compared with the low Ca diet (P < 0.05). There was no change in HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 concentrations. Urinary calcium excretion increased from 146 to 230 mg/d when the high Ca diet was consumed.
