Abstract Endothelium is essential for maintenance of health of the vessel wall and for the local regulation of vascular tone and structure and haemostasis. Regular physical exercise, which is known to promote a favourable cardiovascular state, may improve endothelial function via several mechanisms. Indeed, it augments blood flow and laminar shear stress, resulting in increased nitric oxide production and bioavailability.
