It has been demonstrated that modern biological-organic farming methods clearly lead both to lower leaching of nitrates and to lower nitrate content in vegetables. Since no synthetic fungicides are used in this farming method, problems with the reaction of metabolites of such products and nitrites e.g. to highly cancerogenic and multigenic nitroso-ethylenethiourea do not exist.
