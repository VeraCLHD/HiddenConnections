METHODS: Forty male smokers with clinical diagnosis of COPD (Group-I (GI)) and 36 healthy smokers without COPD (Group-II (GII)) were included in this study. We compared the dietary habits and food intakes of the two groups using an adaptation of the Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire (AFFQ). Question form included a list of 65 food items formed from five main food groups (grain, meat and alternatives, dairy products, vegetables-fruits and fat) and 25 dietary habits.
