The relative risk in the younger age-group was 1.47 (95% CI 0.73–2.97) during the first 10 years of follow-up, and 1.93 (95% CI 1.11–3.37) for follow-up times longer than 10 years. These data suggest that premenopausal women using long-term medication for urinary tract infections show a possible elevated risk of future breast cancer. The results are, however, still inconclusive and the hypothesis needs to be tested by other studies.
