Abstract BACKGROUND: Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is known to be associated with reduced survival but inconsistencies remain, including lack of significance in most studies of healthy women, lack of independence from systolic blood pressure (SBP) in some, and the suggestion that RHR is merely functioning as a marker of physical inactivity or other comorbidities. We aimed to clarify these inconsistencies. METHODS: We analyzed the effect of RHR on end points in the National FINRISK Study; a representative, prospective study using Cox proportional hazards model.
