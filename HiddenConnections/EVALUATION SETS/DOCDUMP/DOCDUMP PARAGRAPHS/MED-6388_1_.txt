Vaginal douching has been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis in observational studies. However, this association may be due to confounding by indicationâ€”that is, confounding by women douching in response to vaginal symptoms associated with bacterial vaginosis. The authors used marginal structural modeling to estimate the causal effect of douching on bacterial vaginosis risk while controlling for this confounding effect.
