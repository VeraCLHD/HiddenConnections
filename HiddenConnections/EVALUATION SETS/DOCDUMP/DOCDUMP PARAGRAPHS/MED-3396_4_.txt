RESULTS: Per cent carotenoid bioaccessibility varied among the nine raw, whole fruits and vegetables evaluated, with values of 1-39% for lycopene, 18-20% for α-carotene, 7-49% for β-carotene, 9-59% for lutein, 4-22% for violaxanthin and 47-96% for phytoene. Per 100 g of food, grapefruit and watermelon imparted the most lycopene (69 and 64 µg respectively), carrot the most α-carotene (559 µg), β-carotene (1078 µg), lutein (91 µg) and phytoene (23 mg) and mango the most violaxanthin (177 µg). Digestive stability averaged over 80%, except for the xanthophylls, which exhibited a wider and lower range of stabilities.
