Abstract BACKGROUND: Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance and vitamin D are associated with reduced cancer mortality rates. However, the previous ecologic study of UVB and cancer mortality rates in the U.S. (Grant, 2002) did not include other risk factors in the analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ecologic study was performed using age-adjusted annual mortality rates for Caucasian Americans for 1950-69 and 1970-94, along with state-averaged values for selected years for alcohol consumption, Hispanic heritage, lung cancer (as a proxy for smoking), poverty, degree of urbanization and UVB in multiple regression analyses.
