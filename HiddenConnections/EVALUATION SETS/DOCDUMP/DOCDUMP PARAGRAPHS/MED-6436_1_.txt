DATA SOURCES: Publications were selected from a systematic review of the English-language literature from established databases (eg, MEDLINE, EBSCO) and the references of materials identified through these databases. STUDY SELECTION: Publications assessing the association between asthma, hay fever, or other allergy-related diseases and cancer were included in this review.
