We examined the association of breaks in objectively measured sedentary time with biological markers of metabolic risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n = 168, mean age 53.4 years) for this cross-sectional study were recruited from the 2004-2005 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle study. Sedentary time was measured by an accelerometer (counts/minute(-1) < 100) worn during waking hours for seven consecutive days.
