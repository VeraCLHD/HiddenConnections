Systolic dysfunction occurs in ∼12% of patients with MS treated with mitoxantrone, congestive heart failure occurs in ∼0.4%, and leukemia occurs in ∼0.8%. The number needed to harm is 8 for systolic dysfunction and 123 for TRAL. There is no new efficacy evidence that would change the recommendation from the previous report.
