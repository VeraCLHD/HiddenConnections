As far as dental plaque was concerned, while total counts did not significantly vary per mg of plaque in the subjects belonging to the different drinking habit subgroups, a significant decrease (P<0.05) was observed in those subjects drinking coffee, tea, barley coffee and wine when mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were evaluated. In several cases a more than one log decrease was observed. Plaque indices were also determined, and a significant (P<0.05) reduction in values was recorded in the subjects belonging the specific drinking habit subgroups compared to the control group.
