Results: In fully-adjusted models, a medium or great proportion of fruits and vegetables in the diet, compared to no or small, was associated with a decreased risk of dementia and AD. This effect was observed among women and those with angina. Similar, but non-significant, odds ratios were found in the co-twin control analyses.
