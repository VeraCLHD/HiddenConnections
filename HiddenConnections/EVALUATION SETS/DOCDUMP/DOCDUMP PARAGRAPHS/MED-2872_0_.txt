Abstract The nutritional treatment of chronic renal failure with a low-protein low-phosphorus diet (conventional low-protein diet, CLPD) is effective in reducing uremic intoxication, slowing the progression of renal failure and preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Unfortunately, in some patients, the poor palatability and the high cost of the protein-free substitutes, together with difficulties in following the diet away from home, can make good compliance difficult, possibly causing low energy intake and malnutrition. Here the results are reported of an attempt we made to overcome these drawbacks, using a diet supplying only natural foods of plant origin in definite proportions to give an essential amino acid supply satisfying the recommended dietary allowance.
