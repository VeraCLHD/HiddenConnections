The cognitive function of illiterate elderly persons was assessed using Chinese revised Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE-r) in 2002 and 2005. Cognitive decline was defined as MMSE-r score dropped to less than 18 at follow-up among those with normal cognitive function (MMSE-râ‰¥18 at baseline). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated via logistic regression models.
