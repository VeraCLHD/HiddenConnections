MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on MACE was obtained through the City of Florence Registry Office. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 4.3 +/- 2.6 years, 139 MACE, 15 of which were fatal, were observed. Cox regression analysis, after adjustment for age and Chronic Disease Score, showed that severe ED predicted MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.75; 95% confidence interval 1.10-2.78; P < 0.05).
