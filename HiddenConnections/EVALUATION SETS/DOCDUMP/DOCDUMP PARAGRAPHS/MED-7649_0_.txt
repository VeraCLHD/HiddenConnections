Abstract The effects of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) at different levels (0 to 0.8 units/g sample) on the properties of gels from lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis) mince set at 25 degrees C for 2 h or 40 degrees C for 30 min prior to heating at 90 degrees C for 20 min were studied. Breaking force and deformation of gels increased with increasing MTGase amount added (P<0.05). At the same MTGase level used, gels with the prior setting at 40 degrees C for 30 min showed a higher breaking force compared with those subjected to prior setting at 25 degrees C for 2 h (P<0.05).
