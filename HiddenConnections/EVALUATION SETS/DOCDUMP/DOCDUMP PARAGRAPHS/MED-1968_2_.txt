The kids were slaughtered at the end of the study and m. longissimus lumborum (LL) was sampled. The TBARS values of both raw and cooked meat were decreased (P<0.0001) by increasing levels of PSP in the diet. The meat of kids fed PSP15 showed higher a* and C* values (P<0.01) and lower H* and b* values (P<0.001), than kids fed with Control diet.
