Recent epidemiological studies have shown that changes in retinal arteriolar and venular caliber size may reflect the differential effects of a range of systemic, environmental, and genetic risk factors. Narrower retinal arteriolar caliber and smaller arteriovenous ratio are associated with older age; higher levels of past, current, and future blood pressure and obesity; and predict the incidence of diabetes and coronary heart disease. Wider retinal venular caliber, in contrast, is associated with younger age; impaired fasting glucose and diabetes; dyslipidemia; obesity; systemic marker of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cigarette smoking; and predicts the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease.
