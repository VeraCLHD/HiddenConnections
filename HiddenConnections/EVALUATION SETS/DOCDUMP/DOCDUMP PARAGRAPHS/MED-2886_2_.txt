Current dietary habits in The Netherlands and the rest of the Western world are slowly shifting from relatively alkalinizing (e.g., potatoes and vegetables) toward more acidifying (e.g., rice and meat). Moreover, immigrants who consumed traditional diets in their homelands, usually adapt to Western dietary habits. This phenomenon of diet acculturation could, for instance, be involved in the up to 40 times higher chance of development of end-stage renal failure in association with diabetes in South-Asian immigrants compared with whites, in Western countries.
