Abstract Although definitive studies have shown that hormone therapy in menopausal women has no overall or cardiovascular health benefit, obstetrician-gynecologists continue to believe that estrogen benefits women's health. This mistaken belief may stem from cultural factors unique to obstetrics and gynecology, as well as from the dependence of physicians on pharmaceutical companies for the provision and interpretation of scientific information.
