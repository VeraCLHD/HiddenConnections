The objective of this study was to validate a sensitive method for the detection of Y. enterocolitica and to describe the distribution of the bacteria in pigs at slaughter from conventional and alternative ("organic") housing systems. First, samples were collected from tonsils, caecum with caecal contents, and the caecal lymph nodes of 60 slaughter pigs. These samples were used to compare the sensitivity of six different laboratory culture methods either in common use or described in the literature with that of a polymerase chain reaction with two primer pairs (multiplex PCR).
