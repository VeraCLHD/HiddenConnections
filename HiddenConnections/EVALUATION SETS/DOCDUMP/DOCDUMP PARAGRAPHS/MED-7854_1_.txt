Twenty-four compounds including 12 triterpenoids, 7 flavonoids, and 5 other phytochemicals were isolated using gradient solvent fractionation, silica gel and ODS columns, and semipreparative and preparative HPLC. Their chemical structures were identified using MS, NMR, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Antiproliferative activities of isolated compounds against Caco-2 human colon cancer cells, HepG2 human liver cancer cells, and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were evaluated.
