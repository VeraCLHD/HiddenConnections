Absorbed organ doses were measured by using an anthropomorphic female phantom and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor detectors. ED was calculated from measured organ doses and the dose-length product. RESULTS: ED for current adult cardiac and pulmonary 64-detector CT angiography protocols were 12.4-31.8 mSv.
