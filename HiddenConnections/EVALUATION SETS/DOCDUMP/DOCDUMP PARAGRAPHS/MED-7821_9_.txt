RESULTS: No significant difference occurred in LDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels across groups. However, a statistically significant difference in total cholesterol occurred within the soy/green tea group 45 and 90 d after intervention. No statistically significant difference occurred in plasma levels of lipid hydroperoxides or those linked to LDL in any of the groups studied.
