More work is needed to define what types and combinations of RS, perhaps with probiotics, exert the greatest effects on colonic environment and epithelial biology, and then to test these in the cancer models for their protective effect. A few studies have examined effect of RS on cancer as an end point in several rodent models, but the results are not clear cut. In conclusion, consumption of RS dramatically affects the colonic lumenal environment and facilitates apoptotic deletion of genetically damaged cells in the colon, several of which are considered to be biomarkers associated with risk for CRC.
