Abstract The research programme that started in 1985 led to the approval of Sildenafil (Viagra), in 1998, as the first oral treatment for male erectile dysfunction. The initial project objective was the design and synthesis of novel inhibitors of phosphodiesterase that would increase tissue levels of cGMP, and that could be beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions. Starting from zaprinast, a weak phosphodiesterase inhibitor, computer modelling guided rational medicinal chemistry to achieve significant increases in potency and selectivity for the 5-isoenzyme within a novel series of pyrazolopyrimidinones.
