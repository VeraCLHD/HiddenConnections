Diabetes was delayed or prevented by these interventions vs control (risk ratio 0.83, 95%CI 0.80-0.86). Non-drug approaches (n = 3495) were superior to drug-based approaches (n = 20,872) in diabetes prevention (0.52, 0.46-0.58 vs 0.70, 0.58-0.85, P < 0.05). There was no difference in risk of all-cause mortality in the intervention versus control group (0.96, 0.84-1.10) and no difference in CV death (1.04, 0.61-1.78).
