Metmyoglobin catalyzed peroxidation of edible oil, resulting in 8-fold increase of hydroperoxide concentration. The incubation of heated muscle tissue in simulated gastric fluid for 2 h enhanced hydroperoxides accumulation by 6-fold to 1200 microM. In the presence of catechin or red wine polyphenols, metmyoglobin catalyzed the breakdown of hydroperoxides to zero, totally preventing lipid peroxidation and beta-carotene cooxidation.
