In opposition to the negative effects of dietary acid load, protein may exert positive effects related to improving calcium absorption, increasing insulin-like growth factor 1, or improving lean body mass, which, in turn, improves bone strength. Putative mechanisms behind these pathways are reviewed here, and some limitations in the historical literature as well as suggested measures to counter these in the future are identified. When positive and negative pathways are considered in tandem, protein may offer modest benefits to bone in the presence of adequate dietary calcium and acid-neutralizing fruits and vegetables.
