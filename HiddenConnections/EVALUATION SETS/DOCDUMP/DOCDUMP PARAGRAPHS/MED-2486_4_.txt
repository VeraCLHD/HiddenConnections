Both studies were a randomized crossover balanced design for the assessment of appetite, energy intake and glycaemic response. RESULTS: In Study 1, ingestion of vinegar significantly reduced quantitative and subjective measures of appetite, which were accompanied by significantly higher nausea ratings, with unpalatable treatment having the greatest effect. Significant correlations between palatability ratings and appetite measures were found.
