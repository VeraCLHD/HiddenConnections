Results: In overall multivariate-adjusted analyses, there were no significant associations between fish intake or any brachial artery measures. However, when stratified by sex, there was an association between the highest quartile of nonfried fish consumption and a 0.10-mm lower (1 SD) brachial artery diameter in men (P = 0.01) and a 0.27% smaller FMD in women (P = 0.02) compared with the lowest quartile of nonfried fish intake in each respective sex strata. When stratified by race-ethnicity and race-ethnicity by sex, additional heterogeneity was noted, but results were difficult to interpret because of small sample sizes.
