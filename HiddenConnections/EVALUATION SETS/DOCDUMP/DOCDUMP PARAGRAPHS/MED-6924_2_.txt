To evaluate the quality of Chinese bamboo shoots we determined the residual content of some OCPs in shoot samples. RESULTS: Three types of OCPs-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), 1,1,1-trichlor-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB)-were detected in bamboo shoots from Zhejiang province, China. Detection rates were 100%, 100% and 75% for HCH, DDT and PCNB, respectively.
