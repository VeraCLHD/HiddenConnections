MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen subjects aged 18-25 years were recruited for the study and were divided randomly into three groups, six in each (group A- plastic glass, B- straw and C- directly from bottle) after the salivary pH was measured. Subjects were requested to refrain from brushing for 24 hours prior to the study. Collection of pooled plaque was done before and after consuming the drink at five, 10-, 20- and 30-minute intervals.
