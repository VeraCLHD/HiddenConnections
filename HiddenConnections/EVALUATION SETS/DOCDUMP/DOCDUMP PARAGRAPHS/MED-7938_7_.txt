The crude extract did not prove to be promutagenic. The ethanol extract of the broccoli flower head at 46 mg/plate suppressed the mutagenic effect induced by the corresponding positive mutagens on all the three tester strains used in this study. The crude extract of broccoli flower head alone was not cytotoxic even at the maximum concentration tested (46 mg/plate).
