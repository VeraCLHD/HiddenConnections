RESULTS: In individuals with vs without non-melanoma skin cancer, multifactorially adjusted odds ratios were 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-0.98) for myocardial infarction and 1.15 (1.12-1.18) for hip fracture, and the multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio was 0.52 (0.52-0.53) for death from any cause. Risk of hip fracture was reduced (odds ratios were below 1.0) in individuals below age 90 years. In individuals with vs without cutaneous malignant melanoma, corresponding odds ratios were 0.79 (0.74-0.84) for myocardial infarction and 0.84 (0.76-0.93) for hip fracture, and the corresponding hazard ratio for death from any cause was 0.89 (0.87-0.91); however, cutaneous malignant melanoma was associated positively with death from any cause in some individuals.
