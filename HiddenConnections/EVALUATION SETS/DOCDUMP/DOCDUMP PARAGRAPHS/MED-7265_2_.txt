Heat treatment of the apoprotein differentially reduced the binding capacity of egg yolk and egg white in a time-dependent manner with the greatest decrease in binding capacity occurring with egg white. In contrast, heat treatment of the holoenzyme delineated the egg yolk as the more labile. These studies suggest that egg yolk and egg white contain distinct R binders which could explain the differential B12 absorption from egg yolk and egg white.
