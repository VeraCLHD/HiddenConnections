The Framingham study alone observed an elevated risk, which was not statistically significant when angina was omitted. A reanalysis of the data showed a nonsignificant protective effect among younger women and a nonsignificant increase in risk among older women. Overall, the bulk of the evidence strongly supports a protective effect of estrogens that is unlikely to be explained by confounding factors.
