Results For use of multivitamins that did not contain zinc the multivariable odds ratios of prostate cancer were 0.6 for 1–4 years, 0.8 for 5–9 years, and 1.2 for 10 years of more, respectively (p for trend =0.70). Men who used zinc for 10 years or more, either in a multivitamin or as a supplement, had an approximately 2-fold (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.6) increased risk of prostate cancer. Vitamin E, beta-carotene, folate, and selenium use were not significantly associated with increased risk of prostate cancer.
