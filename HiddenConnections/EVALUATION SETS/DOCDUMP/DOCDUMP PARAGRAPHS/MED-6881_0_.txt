Abstract A number of technologies that increase feed efficiency and lean tissue deposition while decreasing fat deposition have been developed in an effort to improve profitability of animal production. In general, the mode of action of these metabolic modifiers is to increase muscle deposition while often simultaneously reducing fat deposition. However, there have been some concerns that the focus on increasing production efficiency and lean meat yield has been to the detriment of meat quality.
