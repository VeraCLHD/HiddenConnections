Study selection criteria included peer-reviewed publications of primary data used to estimate SCD incidence in the U.S. We used Web of Science®’s Cited Reference Search to evaluate the impact of each primary estimate on the medical literature by determining the number of times each “primary source” has been cited. The estimated U.S. annual incidence of SCD varied widely from 180,000 to > 450,000 among 6 included studies.
