The appearance of chlorophyllin markers and their derivatives in faeces was similar with mean concentrations of 3.1 and 7.2 Î¼g/g DM, respectively. The most intense fluorescent signal was shown with MgC followed by ZnC, FeC, Sp and Con at 685 nm. The use of markers in pre-slaughter diets would improve the accuracy of faecal detection as a result of greater fluorescence and specific emission wavelengths which do not overlap with natural meat components to help with visualisation.
