Abstract BACKGROUND: An important parallel exists between patients with seasonal affective disorder and institutionalized older adults. Many older patients, as a result of global physical decline and immobility, are confined to their rooms, experiencing little natural sunlight. Thus, institutionalized older adults are at risk for chronic light deprivation.
