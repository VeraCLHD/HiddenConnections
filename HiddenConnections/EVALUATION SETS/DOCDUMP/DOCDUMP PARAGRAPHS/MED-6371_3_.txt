In two thirds of the isolates, adhesion to the gastric cells was inhibited by 0.2 mg/mL of the nondialysable material. There was no relationship between the antiadhesion effect of the cranberry material and metronidazole resistance in isolates from either treated or untreated patients (N=35). Only 13 isolates (16%) were resistant to both the nondialysable material and metronidazole, and 30 (36%) were resistant to the nondialysable material alone.
