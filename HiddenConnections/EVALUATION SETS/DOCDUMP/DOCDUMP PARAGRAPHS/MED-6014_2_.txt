Methionine auxotrophy is a novel niche currently under exploration for targeting certain cancers. AREAS COVERED: In this review we explore the discovery of methionine auxotrophy followed by in vitro, in vivo and patient data on targeting cancer with methionine depletion. We end with a small discussion on bioengineering, pegylation and red blood cell encapsulation as mechanisms for decreasing immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs.
