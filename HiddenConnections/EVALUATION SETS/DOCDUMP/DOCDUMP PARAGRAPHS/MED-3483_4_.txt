At the end of each dietary period all subjects underwent a postprandial study. Plasma concentrations of lipid parameters, soluble intercellular cell-adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), nitrates and nitrites (NOx) and endothelial function studied by laser Doppler were examined at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response was greater 4 h after the ingestion of the MUFA-rich diet than after the SFA or ALA low-fat diets (P = 0.031).
