Consumption of intact seeds compared to ground seeds increased 24 h faecal wet weight (mean 258 g +/- 123 g and 170 g +/- 63 g, respectively; P=0.005) and dry weight (78 g +/- 34 g and 46 g +/- 28 g, respectively; P=0.003). Whole gut transit times and moisture content of stools were not different. There was a trend for stools from the whole seed diet to be more acidic than those from the ground seed diet (pH 6.2 +/- 0.3 and pH 6.6 +/- 0.3, respectively; P=0.06) and they contained more short chain fatty acids (35 +/- 5.2 and 30 +/- 10.5 mmol/kg, respectively; P=0.05).
