The percentage of patients with a reduction in baseline headache pain intensity from severe or moderate to mild or none 2 hours after treatment and the headache pain intensity difference from baseline at 2 hours were the primary efficacy measures. Other measures of pain relief, severity differences from baseline for migraine-associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, and percentage of patients with migraine-associated symptoms reduced to none were also assessed. RESULTS: Significantly (P = .001) more patients treated with acetaminophen 1000 mg reported mild to no pain after 2 hours (52.0%) compared with those treated with placebo (32.0%).
