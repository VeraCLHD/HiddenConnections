Thirty-two hypokalemic patients with active RA were investigated in a parallel, randomized design. In addition to their usual medication, the control group received placebo and the intervention group received 6000 mg chloride potassium dissolved in grape juice on 28 consecutive days. The primary outcome parameter was the change of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS).
