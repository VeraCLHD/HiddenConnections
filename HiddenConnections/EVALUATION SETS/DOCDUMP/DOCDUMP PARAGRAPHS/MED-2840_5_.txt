Since the amounts of all cytokines studied were similar in unstimulated cultures from young and aged subjects, and also serum levels of TNF-alpha did not differ, these data indicate that the cellular machinery for the production of these cytokines is well preserved in aging, and also that cells from old people are able to up-regulate their production in response to appropriate stimuli. The increases in cytokine synthesis were not dependent on changes in the number of monocytes, nor were they related to the significant rise of CD45RO+, and the concomitant decrease of CD45RA+, occurring in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from aged subjects. The increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by stimulated mononuclear cells of healthy aged subjects may be relevant to several aspects of age-associated pathological events, including atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, fibrosis and dementia.
