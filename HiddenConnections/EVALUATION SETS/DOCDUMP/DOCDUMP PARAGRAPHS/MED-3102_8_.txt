During the study, 327 falls occurred in 111 (54%) subjects in the control group, 326 falls in 111 (58%) subjects in the UV only group and 335 falls in 108 (52%) subjects in the UV+ group. By intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant effect of increased UV exposure on falls risk (IRR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.76-1.48; P = 0.73). However, in 66 participants who attended ≥130 sessions per year (adherence, ≥50% of 260 sessions-five per week), falls were significantly reduced (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.88; P = 0.01) compared with the control group.
