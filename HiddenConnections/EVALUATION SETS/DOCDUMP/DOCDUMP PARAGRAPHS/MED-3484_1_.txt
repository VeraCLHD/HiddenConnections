RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A total of 33 participants were examined after consumption of two different isocaloric meals: one rich in MUFA and one rich in SAFA, in the form of extra-virgin olive oil and butter, respectively. Endothelial function was assessed by determination of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). RESULTS—FMD did not change significantly after the MUFA-rich meal but declined after the SAFA-rich meal.
