After adjustment for stage of lactation, milk from macrobiotic mothers contained less calcium, magnesium and saturated fatty acids C15:0-C20:0, and more polyunsaturated fatty acids. Observed tendencies for lower protein and fat and higher lactose concentrations in the macrobiotic group were not statistically significant. Concentrations of vitamin B12, HCB and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180) were lower in the macrobiotic group.
