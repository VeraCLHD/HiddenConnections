Abstract We updated our previous systematic review of the effect of supplemental calcium on blood pressure. We extended our previous searches on MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 1997 and examined citations from relevant articles. We contacted the authors of eligible trials to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data, and to identify unpublished trials.
