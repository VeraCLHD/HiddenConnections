No significant change was detected in either high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol LDL to HDL ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Including walnuts as part of a habitual diet favorably altered the plasma lipid profile. The lipid-lowering effects of walnuts were more evident among subjects with higher lipid baseline values, precisely those people with greater need of reducing plasma total and LDL-C.
