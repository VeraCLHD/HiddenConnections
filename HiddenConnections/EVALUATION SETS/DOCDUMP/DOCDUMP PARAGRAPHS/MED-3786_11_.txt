Co-interventions (e.g. protective environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, central venous catheter care, oral care, hygiene practices and colony-stimulating factors) and outcome definitions also differed between studies. In all included studies it was standard policy to give empirical antibiotics (and sometimes also antimycotics) to (some of) the patients diagnosed with an infection. Two studies included adults and one study included children.
