Abstract The aims of this study were to determine the concentrations of 4-nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (OP) in 59 human milk samples and to examine related factors including mothers' demographics and dietary habits. Women who consumed over the median amount of cooking oil had significantly higher OP concentrations (0.98 ng/g) than those who consumed less (0.39 ng/g) (P < 0.05). OP concentration was significantly associated with the consumption of cooking oil (beta = 0.62, P < 0.01) and fish oil capsules (beta = 0.39, P < 0.01) after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI).
