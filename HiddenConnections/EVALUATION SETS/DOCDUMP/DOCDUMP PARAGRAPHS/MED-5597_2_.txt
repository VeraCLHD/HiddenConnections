The strongest genetic risk markers are located in the HLA region of chromosome 6, but these DNA specificities differ in different populations. Risk genes are indicated in other chromosomes of the human genome, suggesting a complex interaction between genes and environment as the cause of the disease. The pathogenesis of the disease is proposed to be autoimmune in nature and environmental risk factors may either initiate autoimmunity or accelerate an already ongoing beta-cell destruction.
