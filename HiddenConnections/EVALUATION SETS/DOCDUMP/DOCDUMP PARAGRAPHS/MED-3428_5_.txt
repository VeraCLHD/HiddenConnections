RESULTS: Posm was higher in DE than control (CON), indicating suboptimal hydration when using the 316 mOsm/L Tosm cutoff for DE (mean Posm + 11 mOsm/kg versus CON, P = 0.004, Cohen's effect size [d]) = 0.83) and the more conservative Tosm classification for DE where Tosm >324 and CON <308 mOsm/L (mean Posm + 12 mOsm/kg versus CON, P = 0.006, d = 0.94). Posm was also higher in DE than CON when using composite DE assessments, including Tosm and DEQ-5 (P = 0.021, d = 1.07); Tosm and NITBUT (P = 0.013, d = 1.08); and the VAS and DEQ-5 (P = 0.034, d = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: These are the first published data to show that individuals classified as DE have higher Posm, indicating suboptimal hydration, compared with non-DE.
