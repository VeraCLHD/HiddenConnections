Histologically, infected tissues contained mixed suppurative and granulomatous inflammation associated with endosporulating, round to oval microorganisms, ranging from 6-9 microns in diameter. Many of these organisms contained multiple, strongly periodic acid-Schiff, Gomori methenamine-silver, and Gridley fungus-positive granules in the cytoplasm. The organisms in tissue did not stain with fluorescent antibody conjugates specific for the two known pathogenic Prototheca species.
