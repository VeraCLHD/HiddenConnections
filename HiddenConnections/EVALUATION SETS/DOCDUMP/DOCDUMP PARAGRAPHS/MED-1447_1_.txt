This study tested the hypothesis that high-intensity exercise has the ability to produce free radicals that may be capable of causing DNA damage. Twelve apparently healthy male subjects (age: 23 ± 4 years; stature: 181 ± 8 cm; body mass: 80 ± 9 kg; and VO(2max) : 49 ± 5 ml/kg/min) performed three 5 min consecutive and incremental stages (40, 70, and 100% of VO(2max) ) of aerobic exercise with a 15-min period separating each stage. Blood was drawn after each bout of exercise for the determination of ex vivo free radicals, DNA damage, protein carbonyls, lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) concentration, and a range of lipid-soluble antioxidants.
