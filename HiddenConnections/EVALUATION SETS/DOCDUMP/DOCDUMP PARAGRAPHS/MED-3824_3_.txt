METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that compared the prevalence of reflux esophagitis of 148 Buddhist priests, who are obligatory vegetarians with that of age- and sex-matched controls who underwent health checkups in a health promotion center. RESULTS: The prevalence of reflux esophagitis was higher in the control group than in the Buddhist priest group (21.6 vs 12.2 %). Weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and abdominal adipose tissue area were higher and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol were lower in the Buddhist priest group.
