In men, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for tooth loss with a cut-off point of <20 teeth associated with different frequencies of green tea consumption were 1.00 (reference) for <1 cup/day, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.91) for 1-2 cups/day, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92) for 3-4 cups/day, and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.89) for > or = 5 cups/day. The corresponding data for women and the results for cut-off points of 10 and 25 teeth were essentially the same. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate an association of green tea consumption with decreased odds for tooth loss.
