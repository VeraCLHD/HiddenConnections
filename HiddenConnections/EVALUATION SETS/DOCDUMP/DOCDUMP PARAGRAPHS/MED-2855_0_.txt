PURPOSE: To systematically review the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on minimizing progression to diabetes in high-risk patients or progression to clinical outcomes (such as cardiovascular disease and death) in patients with type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: 5 electronic databases (1980 to June 2013), reference lists, and gray literature.
