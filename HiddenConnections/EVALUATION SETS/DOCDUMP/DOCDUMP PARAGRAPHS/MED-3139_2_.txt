METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 50 patients who underwent the head-up tilt test (HUT) to evaluate syncope, 27 patients with positive HUT were classified as group I (14 men, 13 women; mean age 44.5+/-15.3 years), 23 patients with negative HUT were classified as group II (13 men, 10 women; mean age 41.2 +/-16.7 years), and 21 normal subjects were classified as group III (10 men, 11 women; mean age 28.6+/-6.3 years). The effects of the physical maneuvers were evaluated in 21 patients from group I who underwent a repeat HUT 1 week after the initial test. Leg-crossing significantly increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in all 3 groups (8.0+/-5.8 mmHg in group I, 7.0+/-8.5 mmHg in group II, 8.7+/-5.7 mmHg in group III; p < 0.05), but not diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
