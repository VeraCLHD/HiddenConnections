Abstract Various pesticides are being used to destabilize, perturb, or inhibit crucial biochemical and physiological targets related to metabolism, growth, development, nervous communication, or behavior in pestiferous organisms. Chitin is an eukaryotic extracellular aminosugar biopolymer, massively produced by most fungal systems and by invertebrates, notably arthropods. Being an integral supportive component in fungal cell wall, insect cuticle, and nematode egg shell, chitin has been considered as a selective target for pesticide action.
