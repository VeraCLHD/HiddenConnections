Alpha gal epitopes, previously assumed to be absent from human tissue, have been demonstrated on several human cancer cell lines, senescent red blood cells, and Graves' disease thyrocytes. Alpha-gal presence on neoplastic lines is correlated with increased metastatic formation in animal models. The mechanisms of human response to these neoantigens are complex, as natural anti-gal antibodies exist in high titers in normal sera, thus predicting immunological recognition of cells expressing alpha gal epitopes.
