Abstract The epidemiology of gout has changed dramatically over the past century. Once thought of as a disease of the nobility, it is now an egalitarian disease that affects patients across the socioeconomic spectrum. The incidence of gout has also risen in recent years, to the point that we are now seeing what is regarded by some as a "second epidemic" of gout.
