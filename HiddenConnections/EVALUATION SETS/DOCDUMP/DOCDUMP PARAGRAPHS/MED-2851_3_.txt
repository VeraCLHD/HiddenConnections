Several recent large trials attempted to answer this question using a randomized control trial design with a conventional therapy and an intensive control arm. Surprisingly, these trials did not demonstrate neither mortality nor a CVD advantage with intensive glycemic control. Moreover, some studies (e.g., the ACCORD [Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes] study) showed increased mortality in the intensive control arm.
