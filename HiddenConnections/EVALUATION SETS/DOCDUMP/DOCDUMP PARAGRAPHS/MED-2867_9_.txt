Serum levels of lycopene increased in supplemented subjects; the other carotenoids did not change significantly, and no change in serum carotenoids was observed in the control group. At wk 10, dorsal erythema formation was 40% lower in the group that consumed tomato paste compared with controls (P = 0.02; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). No significant difference between groups was found at wk 4 of treatment.
