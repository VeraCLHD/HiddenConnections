In addition, fresh unfixed carotid plaques were examined at 37 degrees C using confocal microscopy. Crystal content using SEM was scored from 0 to +3. SEM using vacuum dehydration had significantly higher crystal content compared with SEM using ethanol dehydration (+2.5 +/- 0.53 vs +0.25 +/- 0.46; p <0.0003), with enhanced detection of CC perforations.
