Abstract A commercial weight loss program with a client base composed of >95% women experienced sporadic complaints of nausea and vomiting after changing its multivitamin supplier. This retrospective and observational study was designed to determine if related adverse event reports were significant, and to investigate potential mechanism for their occurrence in this group of subjects, many of whom were concurrently receiving oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Incidence of nausea, vomiting, rash, and total complaints in the 3 months following the change of the multivitamin formulation was compared with the same complaints in the 3 months before the change.
