We report the case of a 10-month-old female diagnosed with West syndrome associated with vitamin B(12) deficiency but without macrocytic anaemia caused by nutritional inadequacy in the mother. The patient's motor skills and cognitive development were normal until she was 9 months old, when she began to exhibit a series of sudden flexions of the head, trunk, arms, and legs. She was exclusively breast-fed and had received no vitamin supplementation.
