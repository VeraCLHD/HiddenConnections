All data were divided into 2 groups according to beverage type: group T (black tea) and group C (caffeine). Two-way analysis of variance showed a significant group effect and interaction in CFVR before and after beverage consumption (p = 0.001). CFVR significantly increased after tea consumption in group T (4.5 +/- 0.9 vs 5.2 +/- 0.9, p <0.0001).
