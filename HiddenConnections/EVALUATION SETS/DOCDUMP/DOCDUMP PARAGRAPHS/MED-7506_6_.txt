More recent blood concentration data, from NHANES 2001/2, suggest an adult average at 21.7 pg/g TEQ lwt. These TEQ values include the 17 dioxin and furan congeners and 3 coplanar PCBs, and were generated substituting ND=(1/2)DL or ND=DL/sq rt (2). Results are provided for ND=0 and analyses conducted to evaluate the impacts of this substitution.
