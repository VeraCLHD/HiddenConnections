DRW consumption did not significantly change postprandial TG or insulin levels. A 35% (p = 0.02) increase in postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels and a 54% (p = 0.02) increase in insulin levels were observed following RW consumption, compared to water. In conclusion, acute DRW consumption had no effect on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in dyslipidaemic postmenopausal women.
