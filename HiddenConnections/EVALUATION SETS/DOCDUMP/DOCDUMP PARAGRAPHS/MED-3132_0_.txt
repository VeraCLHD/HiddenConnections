Abstract Syncope is a clinical syndrome characterized by transient loss of consciousness and postural tone that is most often due to temporary and spontaneously self-terminating global cerebral hypoperfusion. A common presenting problem to health care systems, the management of syncope imposes a considerable socioeconomic burden. Clinical guidelines, such as the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Management of Syncope, have helped to streamline its management.
