Abstract Piceatannol (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a polyphenol present in grapes and wine. By means of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we have shown that piceatannol exhibits a significant induction of differentiation in immortalized fetal osteoblasts (hFOB), and osteosarcoma cells (MG-63). Alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin are phenotypic markers for early-stage differentiated osteoblasts and terminally differentiated osteoblasts, respectively, our results indicate that piceatannol stimulate osteoblast differentiation at various stages (from maturation to terminally differentiated osteoblasts).
