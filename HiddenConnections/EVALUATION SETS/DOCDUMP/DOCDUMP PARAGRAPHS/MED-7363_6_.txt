On the contrary, PS does not cause cell cycle delay as noted by the non-significant decrease in the cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) and replicative index (RI). Only a slight decrease was observed in the mitotic index (MI) at the highest concentration for both treatment times. From the results, PS is clearly seen to be genotoxic to the human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro.
