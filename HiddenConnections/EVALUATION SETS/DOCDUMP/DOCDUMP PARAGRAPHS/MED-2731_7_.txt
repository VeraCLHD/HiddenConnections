RESULTS: During 12 years of follow-up (397,309 person-years), there were 2015 incident cases of total stroke (1532 ischaemic strokes, 216 intracerebral haemorrhages, 94 subarachnoid haemorrhages and 173 unspecified strokes). Multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RR), controlled for known stroke risk factors and fish consumption, were 1.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-2.17] for total stroke, 1.61 (95% CI, 1.19-2.17) for ischaemic stroke and 2.80 (95% CI, 1.42-5.55) for haemorrhagic stroke for women in the highest quartile of dietary PCB exposure (median 288 ng day(-1) ) compared with women in the lowest quartile (median 101 ng day(-1) ). CONCLUSION: Dietary exposure to PCBs was associated with an increased stroke risk in women, especially haemorrhagic stroke.
