The prolonged sitting intervention involved sitting for 9 h, the physical activity intervention involved walking for 30 min and then sitting, and the regular-activity-break intervention involved walking for 1 min 40 s every 30 min. Participants consumed a meal-replacement beverage at 60, 240, and 420 min. RESULTS: The plasma incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for insulin differed between interventions (overall P < 0.001).
