For this purpose, we have developed a radioimmunoassay (RIA) which enables the quantification of Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues on the secreted glycoproteins. Purified biotinylated anti-Gal was used as the antibody in the RIA, and bovine thyroglobulin enriched for Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residues served as a solid-phase antigen. In this study, it is reported for the first time that the evolutionary pattern of Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc residue distribution in in vivo secreted glycoproteins is similar to that observed in membranes of cell lines and of red cells.
