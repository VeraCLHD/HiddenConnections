Mate-exposed lymphocytes had a reduced transcriptional rDNA activity, which may be due to the stress conditions, and showed an elevated production of micronuclei. The FISH technique revealed the appearance of an acrocentric signal in mate-induced micronuclei, which suggests that under these conditions yerba mate extract may display aneugenic activity. Since caffeine is one of the most abundant compounds found in the dry mass of mate, we conducted additional experiments with caffeine alone.
