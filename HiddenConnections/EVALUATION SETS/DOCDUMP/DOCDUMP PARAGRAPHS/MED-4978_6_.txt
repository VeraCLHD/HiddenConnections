After 4 weeks, consumption of BSP resulted in significant decrease in MDA (P=0.001 for treatment effect), oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.03 for treatment effect), OSI (P=0.001 for treatment effect) and significant increase in TAC (P=0.001 for treatment effect). No effects were found on TOS. CONCLUSION: BSP had favorable effects on oxidative stress status in type 2 diabetes patients.
