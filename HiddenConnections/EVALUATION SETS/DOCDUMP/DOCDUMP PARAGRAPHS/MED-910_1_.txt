METHODS AND RESULTS: To obtain insights into the role of MPs in atherogenesis, MP proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry, metabolite profiles were determined by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and antibody reactivity was assessed against combinatorial antigen libraries. Plaque MPs expressed surface antigens consistent with their leukocyte origin, including major histocompatibility complex classes I and II, and induced a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on T-cell proliferation. Notably, taurine, the most abundant free organic acid in human neutrophils, which scavenges myeloperoxidase-catalyzed free radicals, was highly enriched in plaque MPs.
