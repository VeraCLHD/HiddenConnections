Anti-Gal IgM and IgG further mediate rejection of xenografts expressing α-gal epitopes. Because of its abundance, anti-Gal may be exploited for various clinical uses. It increases immunogenicity of microbial vaccines (e.g. influenza vaccine) presenting α-gal epitopes by targeting them for effective uptake by antigen-presenting cells.
