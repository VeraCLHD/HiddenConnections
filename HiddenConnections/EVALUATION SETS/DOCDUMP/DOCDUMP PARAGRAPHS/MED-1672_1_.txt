Crocus sativus (saffron) may inhibit the aggregation and deposition of amyloid Î² in the human brain and may therefore be useful in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy of saffron in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. METHODS: Forty-six patients with probable AD were screened for a 16-week, double-blind study of parallel groups of patients with mild to moderate AD.
