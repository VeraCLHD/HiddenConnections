Abstract Nineteen unselected patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, whose average supine blood pressure after two months' observation on no treatment was 156/98 mm Hg, were advised not to add salt to food and to avoid sodium-laden foods. After 2 weeks of sodium restriction patients were entered into an 8-week double-blind randomised crossover study of 'Slow Sodium' (Ciba) versus slow sodium placebo. The mean supine blood pressure was 7.1 mm Hg (6.1%) lower in the fourth week of placebo than that in the fourth week of slow sodium (p less than 0.001).
