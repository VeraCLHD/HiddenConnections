Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine whether a single LDL apheresis would improve impaired endothelium-dependent dilation of the coronary artery in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia is associated with impaired endothelial function, and human studies using cholesterol-lowering drugs indicate that endothelial function in the coronary arteries improves with reduction of serum LDL cholesterol over 6 to 12 months. The internal diameter of the left coronary artery and the coronary blood flow were measured by intracoronary Doppler-wire measurement and quantitative angiography before and immediately after a single LDL apheresis in a population of 15 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
