PRAL was calculated from dietary calcium (PRALdiet) and diet + supplemental calcium (PRALtotal). Tests for linear trend in adjusted mean BMD of the hip and lumbar spine were performed across energy adjusted NEAP and PRAL quartiles. Modification by calcium intake (dietary or total) above or below 800 mg/d was assessed by interaction terms.
