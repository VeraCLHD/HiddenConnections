INTERVENTION: Participants were required to consume sufficient milk to provide 25 g protein/d from each source. The protocol included three 4-week treatment phases, each separated from the next by a wash-out period of >or=4 weeks. RESULTS: Mean LDL-C concentration at the end of each phase (+/- SD) was 161 +/- 20, 161 +/- 26 and 170 +/- 24 mg/dL for the whole bean soy milk, the soy protein isolate milk, and the dairy milk, respectively (p = 0.9 between soy milks, p = 0.02 for each soy milk vs. dairy milk).
