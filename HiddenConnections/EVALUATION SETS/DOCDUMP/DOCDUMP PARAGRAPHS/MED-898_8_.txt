No binding and no stimulatory effects of anti-Gal were observed, however, with normal human thyrocytes and with thyrocytes from thyrotoxic patients who lack thyroid-stimulating Igs or thyrotropin binding inhibiting Igs. These in vitro stimulatory effects of anti-Gal on GD thyrocytes suggest that this natural Ab may contribute to the in vivo continuous stimulation of thyrocytes in GD patients. The possibility that anti-Gal may stimulate GD thyrocytes via interaction with aberrantly expressed alpha-galactosyl epitopes on the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor is discussed.
