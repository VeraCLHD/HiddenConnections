The average number of cigarettes smoked per day correlated well with urinary 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations (rs = 0.67, P < 0.001). The consumption of PAH-containing food products and active smoking account for 99% of total pyrene intake. The effect of age on 1-hydroxypyrene excretion is probably caused by a lower creatinine excretion in the elderly.
