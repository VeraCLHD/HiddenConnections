The methanolic extracts of grapes prolonged the PT and dPT. Finally, extracts of raspberry prolonged the APTT and also presented fibrinolytic activity. In conclusion, from a screening that included a variety of fruits and vegetables, we found antiplatelet activity in green beans and tomatoes, anticoagulant activities in grapes and raspberries, whereas fibrinolytic activity was observed only in raspberries.
