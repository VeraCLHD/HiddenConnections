The highest average PCB and PE concentrations were found in urban fish eaters, followed by rural fish eaters, urban vegetarians, and rural vegetarians. The total motile sperm counts in infertile men were inversely proportional to their xenoestrogen concentrations and were significantly lower than those in the respective controls. CONCLUSION(S): PCBs and PEs may be instrumental in the deterioration of semen quality in infertile men without an obvious etiology.
