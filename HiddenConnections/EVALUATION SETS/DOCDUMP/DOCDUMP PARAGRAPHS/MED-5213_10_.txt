In fully adjusted models, high vegetable intake was protective against allergic asthma (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.84; P < 0.009) and moderate/severe AHR (OR 0.58; 0.37-0.91; P < 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Vegetable intake is inversely associated with allergic asthma and moderate/severe AHR. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
