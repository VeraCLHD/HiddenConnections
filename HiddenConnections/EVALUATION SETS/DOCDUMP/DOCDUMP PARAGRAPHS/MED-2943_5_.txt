ApoE mediates cholesterol homeostasis in the body and is a major lipid carrier in brain. As such, its expression in the periphery and in brain changes in response to changes in cholesterol metabolism. Here, we used a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis to examine whether the diet-induced or pharmacologically induced changes in plasma cholesterol that result in altered brain amyloidosis also affect ApoE content in liver and in brain.
