Breast and thigh muscle tissues were collected from each bird (n = 5 birds per day per group) during the dosing and withdrawal period, and fluoroquinolone concentrations were determined. The results indicate higher overall enrofloxacin concentrations in breast versus thigh muscle for each treatment group (P < 0.05). These data indicate, at least for enrofloxacin, that not all muscle tissues incorporate antibiotics at the same concentrations.
