HPA axis activation increases cortisol (corticosterone) production which has been shown to exert hyperphagic and antithermogenic effects. Since abdominal adipose tissue has more cells per mass units, higher blood flow and more glucocorticoid receptors, glucocorticoids affect abdominal fat to a greater extent than subcutaneous adipose tissue. Cushing's syndrome in humans is the best evidence showing a link between hypercortisolemia and accumulation of central fat.
