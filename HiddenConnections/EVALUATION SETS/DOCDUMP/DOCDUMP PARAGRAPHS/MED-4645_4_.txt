This model provides a structural mechanism for the processivity of telomerase and offers new insights into elongation. We conclude that the RNAâˆ¶DNA heteroduplex is constrained by the telomerase TEN domain through repeated extension cycles and that the TEN domain controls the process by moving the template ahead one base at a time by translation and rotation of the double helix. The RNA region directly following the template can bind complementarily to the newly synthesized telomeric DNA, while the template itself is reused in the telomerase active site during the next reaction cycle.
