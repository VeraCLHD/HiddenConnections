Spermiogram, seminal biochemical studies, measurements of plasma hormone levels and lipid determinations were carried out. Most hyperlipoproteinaemic patients showed abnormalities in the spermiograms and the mean values were lower than in the controls except for semen volume. Seminal biochemical determinations were normal in the majority and the hormone profile showed some abnormal values, mainly for E2.
