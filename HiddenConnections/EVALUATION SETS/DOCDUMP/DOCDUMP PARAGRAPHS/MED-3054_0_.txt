Abstract Isoflavones are legume-specific flavonoids best known for their potential cancer preventive and phytoestrogenic properties. In this study, we attempted to engineer the isoflavone pathway in the popular fruit crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L). Tomato plants were transformed with a soybean (Glycine max L) isoflavone synthase (GmIFS2) cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.
