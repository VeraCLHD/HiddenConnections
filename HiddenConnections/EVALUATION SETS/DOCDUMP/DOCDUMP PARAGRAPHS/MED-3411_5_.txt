MEASUREMENTS: Fasting plasma bile acid concentrations were determined by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The mean plasma DCA concentration was 52% higher (P=0.012) in patients with breast cancer compared with controls. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that DCA may be involved in the aetiology of breast cancer.
