Co-treated cells further displayed distinctive morphological changes that occurred during the apoptotic process, such as cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, membrane blebbing as well as the occurence of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments. Further observations thereby pointed toward simultaneous activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. With increasing concentrations and treatment duration, a shift from apoptotic to necrotic cell death could be observed.
