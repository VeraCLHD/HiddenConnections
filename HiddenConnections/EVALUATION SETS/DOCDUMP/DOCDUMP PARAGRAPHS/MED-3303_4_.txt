Immediately after birth, there was pulmonary hypertension by echocardiogram with DA closure, severe RV hypertrophy and dysfunction, and marked right-to-left atrial shunting. Improvement occurred over 3 weeks with the neonate tolerating room air and a follow-up echocardiogram showing minimal atrial shunting and improved RV function. This report shows an association between MonaVie ingestion throughout pregnancy and prenatal DA closure resulting in cardiac dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension at birth.
