Based on self-reported levels of anxiety, in-session avoidance and fainting, AT was superior over other conditions; however, when considering pre- to post-treatment effect sizes on BII-related questionnaires, E outperformed all other treatments. In addition, AT did not yield better results on physiological measures, and individuals with BII fears improved similarly within studies across treatment groups, regardless of fainting status. Heterogeneity in patient populations (e.g. extent of fainting-proneness), differential targeting of BII phobia manifestations, and small sample sizes may explain some of the variability in findings.
