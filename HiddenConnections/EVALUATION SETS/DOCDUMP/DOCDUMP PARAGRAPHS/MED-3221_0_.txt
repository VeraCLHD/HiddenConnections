Abstract The complex association of cholesterol metabolism and Alzheimer's disease is presented in depth, including the possible benefits to be gained from cholesterol-lowering statin therapy. Then follows a survey of the role of neuronal membrane cholesterol in Abeta pore formation and Abeta fibrillogenesis, together with the link with membrane raft domains and gangliosides. The contribution of structural studies to Abeta fibrillogenesis, using TEM and AFM, is given some emphasis.
