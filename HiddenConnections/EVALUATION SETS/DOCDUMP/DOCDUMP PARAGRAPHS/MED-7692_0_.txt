Abstract High-dose β-carotene supplementation in high-risk persons has been linked to increased lung cancer risk in clinical trials; whether effects are similar in the general population is unclear. The authors examined associations of supplemental β-carotene, retinol, vitamin A, lutein, and lycopene with lung cancer risk among participants, aged 50–76 years, in the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort Study in Washington State. In 2000–2002, eligible persons (n = 77,126) completed a 24-page baseline questionnaire, including detailed questions about supplement use (duration, frequency, dose) during the previous 10 years from multivitamins and individual supplements/mixtures.
