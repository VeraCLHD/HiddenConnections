The clinical signs of the food allergies were cutaneous (n=153, 62.7%), digestive (n = 74, 30.3%), respiratory (n = 17, 6.9%), and anaphylactic shock (n = 12, 4.9%). CONCLUSION: While well aware of the biases inherent in this type of study, we estimated the cumulative and point prevalences of food allergies in a population of school-age children in Toulouse at 6.7% and 4.7%, respectively. Cow milk, eggs, and peanuts were the main foods reported as causing allergies.
