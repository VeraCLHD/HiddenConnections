Within the systems biology framework, functional analyses at the level of gene expression (transcriptomics), protein translation (proteomics), and, more recently, the metabolite network (metabolomics) have become increasingly popular. Metabolomics experiments aim to quantify all metabolites in a cellular system (cell or tissue) under defined states and at different time points so that the dynamics of any biotic, abiotic, or genetic perturbation can be accurately assessed. This article provides an overview of metabolomics and discusses how data are generated and analyzed within a systems biology framework.
