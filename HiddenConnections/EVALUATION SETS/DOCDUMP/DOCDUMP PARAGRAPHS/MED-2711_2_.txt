Pretreatment with deferoxamine or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid abolishes the ability of the lesions to catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), strongly suggesting the involvement of associated transition metal ions. Indeed, following chelated removal of metals, incubation with iron or copper salts reestablished lesion-dependent catalytic redox reactivity. Although DAB oxidation can also detect peroxidase activity, this was inactivated by H2O2 pretreatment before use of DAB, as shown by a specific peroxidase detection method.
