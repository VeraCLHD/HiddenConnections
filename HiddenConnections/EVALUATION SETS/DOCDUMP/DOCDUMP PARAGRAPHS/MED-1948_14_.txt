In addition, adverse events were more common with tricyclic antidepressants and alosetron. CONCLUSION: In irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, tricyclic antidepressants and alosetron are associated with a significant number needed to harm compared with rifaximin. Apart from lubiprostone, treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is limited to small studies (with poor descriptions of side effects), although lubiprostone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear safe.
