All isolates were ribotype 078, a strain that has been associated with food animals and potentially community-associated disease in humans. All positive samples were positive only on enrichment culture. CONCLUSIONS: Clostridium difficile could be found relatively commonly in retail chicken meat, albeit at low levels.
