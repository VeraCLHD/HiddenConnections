Tissue and plasma concentrations are tightly controlled in response to oral administration, but this can be bypassed by intravenous administration. These data provide a plausible scientific rationale for the absence of a response to orally administered ascorbate in the Mayo clinic trials and indicate the need to reassess ascorbate as a cancer therapeutic. Recent Advances: High dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
