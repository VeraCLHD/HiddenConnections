MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sagittal T2-weighted images of the lumbar spine were obtained in 37 asymptomatic volunteers aged 22-68 years. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 98 lumbar intervertebral disks was determined, and two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography was performed on the corresponding 98 lumbar artery pairs (total arteries = 196). The degree of disk degeneration and the status of lumbar arteries were evaluated independently by two radiologists.
