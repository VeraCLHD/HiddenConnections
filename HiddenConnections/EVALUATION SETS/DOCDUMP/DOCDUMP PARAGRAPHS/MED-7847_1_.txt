We have reported that tomato extract (TE) could possibly inhibit histamine release and mouse ear-swelling responses. Moreover, it is reported that TE could relieve the symptoms for Japanese cedar pollinosis. METHODS: To evaluate the anti-allergic effect of TE, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 33 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) using oral administration of TE (360 mg per day) or placebo for 8 weeks.
