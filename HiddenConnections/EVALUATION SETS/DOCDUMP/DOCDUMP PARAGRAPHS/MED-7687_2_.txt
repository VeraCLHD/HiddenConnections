The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CD in at-risk and not-at-risk groups in the United States. METHODS: Serum antigliadin antibodies and anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) were measured. In EMA-positive subjects, human tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies and CD-associated human leukocyte antigen DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes were determined.
