BRCA1 protein expression was normal (>50 % tumour cells) in 41 (43 %) cases, reduced (20-50 % tumour cells) in 33 (35 %) cases and absent/markedly reduced (<20 % tumour cells) in 21 (22.1 %) cases. Cases which were negative for BRCA1 protein were more frequently positive for basal markers (29 versus 5 %) and were more often ER-negative (62 versus 39 %) than BRCA1-positive tumours. Methylation of BRCA1 promoter region was seen in 11/45 cases (24 %).
