Abstract The cytotoxic effects of Triphala (TPL), an Indian Ayurvedic formulation with known anti-cancer properties, has been investigated on two human breast cancer cell lines differing in their p53 status. In vitro studies showed that MCF 7 with wild type p53 was more sensitive to TPL than T 47 D, which is p53 negative. TPL induced loss of cell viability was determined by MTT assay.
