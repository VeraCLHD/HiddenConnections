The concentrations of butyrate that were effective for inducing apoptosis were similar to the concentrations that caused hyperacetylation of core histones in the VACO 5 cell line. Furthermore, an examination of other carboxylic acids for induction of apoptosis revealed a rank order that corresponded to the order of potency in causing hyperacetylation of core histones. Specifically, the active acids were 3-5 carbons in length and lacked substitution at the 2-position.
