A statistical increase was observed in the damaged buccal and blood cells after the CHX application. The mean grade of damage in buccal cells was statistically different from that in blood cells. Due to minimal absorption of chlorhexidine into the tissues and low concentrations of free chlorhexidine in the oral cavity, the DNA damage produced by chlorhexidine in lymphocytes was lower than in buccal epithelial cells.
