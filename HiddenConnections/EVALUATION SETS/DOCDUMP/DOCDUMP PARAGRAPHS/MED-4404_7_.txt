RESULTS: The lumbar arterial status correlated strongly with the diffusion values of intervertebral disks, and the ADC values decreased with higher degrees of arterial narrowing. The correlation between disk degeneration and diffusion was not significant. Eight severely degenerated disks with normal lumbar artery status and diffusion values were found.
