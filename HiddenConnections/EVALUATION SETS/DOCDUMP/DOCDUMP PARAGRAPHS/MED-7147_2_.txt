The aim of the conducted research was to determine the influence of μ-opioid receptor agonist peptides: human and bovine β-casomorphin-7 (h/bBCM-7) and antagonistic peptides: casoxin-6 and- D (CXN-6/D) on proliferation and cytokine secretion of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PBMCs proliferation was measured by the use of the BrdU test, which assesses the DNA synthesis activity and the WST-1 test which assesses the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes. The influence of all the investigated peptides on secretion of IL-4, IL-8, IL-13 and IFN-γ was determined by the use of the ELISA tests.
