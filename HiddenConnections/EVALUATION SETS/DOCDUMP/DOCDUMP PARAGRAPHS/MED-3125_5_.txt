The serum ionized calcium concentration increased significantly after ingesting cheese (P = 0.004, contrast analysis) or calcium salt (P = 0.05, contrast analysis) compared with the control session. Compared with the control session, the serum phosphate concentration increased after the cheese session (P = 0.004, contrast analysis) and after the milk session (P = 0.02, contrast analysis). Calcium salt (P = 0.007, contrast analysis) and cheese (P = 0.002, contrast analysis) caused a significant decline in serum intact parathyroid hormone compared with the control session.
