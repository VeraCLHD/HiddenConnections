Anti-Gal is naturally produced also in apes and Old World monkeys. The ligand of anti-Gal is a carbohydrate antigen called the ‘α-gal epitope’ with the structure Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R. The α-gal epitope is present as a major carbohydrate antigen in non-primate mammals, prosimians and New World monkeys.
