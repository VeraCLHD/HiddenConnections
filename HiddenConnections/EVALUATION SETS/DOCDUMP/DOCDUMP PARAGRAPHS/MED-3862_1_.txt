These compounds are of great biological interest because they exhibit both in vitro and in vivo weak estrogenic and sometimes also antiestrogenic activities and many plant lignans have been shown to have anticarcinogenic, antiviral, antifungal and other interesting biological effects. The compounds found in relatively large amounts (10-1000 times more than estrogens) in urine are modified by intestinal bacteria from plant lignans and phytoestrogens, which are present in fiber-rich food such as grain and beans. They bind with low affinity to estrogen receptors and preliminary results suggest that they may induce production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver and in this way may influence sex hormone metabolism and biological effects.
