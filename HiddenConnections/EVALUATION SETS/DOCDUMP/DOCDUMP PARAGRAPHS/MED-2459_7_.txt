Subgroup analysis revealed that the effect of acarbose was restricted to those subjects with an increase of blood glucose above the median increase of glycaemia. No changes of plasma ADMA were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly demonstrate that the postchallenge alteration of vascular function in patients with impaired glucose tolerance is caused by the acute elevation of glycaemia but not mediated by ADMA.
