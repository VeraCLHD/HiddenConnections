The risks for osteoporosis, as reflected by low bone density, and the risks for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions known to be associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important, but as yet poorly validated, role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing risk of fracture, and in determining who should be treated.
