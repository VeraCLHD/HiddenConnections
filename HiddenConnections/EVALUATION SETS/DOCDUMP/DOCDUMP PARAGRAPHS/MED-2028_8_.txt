OR for CV mortality among Hispanics was 0.49; 95% CI 0.30-0.80; p-value <0.01; and OR for all-cause mortality was 0.66; 95% CI 0.43-1.02; p-value 0.06. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the existence of a Hispanic paradox regarding CV mortality. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms mediating this protective CV effect in Hispanics.
