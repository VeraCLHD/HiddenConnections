Recent studies show that not only the total amount, but also the distribution of cholesterol within neurons, impacts Abeta biogenesis. The identification of a variant of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene as a major genetic risk factor for AD is also consistent with a role for cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD. Clinical trials have recently been initiated to test whether lowering plasma and/or neuronal cholesterol levels is a viable strategy for treating and preventing AD.
