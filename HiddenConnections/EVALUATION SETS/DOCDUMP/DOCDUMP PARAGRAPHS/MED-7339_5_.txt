Data were analyzed with logistic regression for the entire sample using generalized estimating equations to adjust for relatedness of twins, and with conditional logistic regression for the co-twin control design. Results: In fully-adjusted models, a medium or great proportion of fruits and vegetables in the diet, compared to no or small, was associated with a decreased risk of dementia and AD. This effect was observed among women and those with angina.
