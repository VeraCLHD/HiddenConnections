DISCUSSION: The mechanism of toxicity of GlySH is complicated and surfactant was thought to play an important role in GlySH intoxication. Intramuscular GlySH poisoning is different from oral GlySH intoxication. Care should be taken when monitoring acute rhabdomyolysis and compartment syndrome, which may develop rapidly and contribute to the surfactant component of glyphosate formulation.
