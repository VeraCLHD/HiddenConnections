Abstract Chlorinated pesticides can contain impurities of dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and their precursors, as a result of various manufacturing processes and conditions. As precursor formation of PCDD/Fs can also be mediated by ultraviolet light (UV), this study investigated whether PCDD/Fs are formed when currently used pesticides are exposed to natural sunlight. Formulations containing pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB; n=2) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; n=1) were exposed to sunlight in quartz tubes, and the concentration of 93 PCDD/F congeners were monitored over time.
