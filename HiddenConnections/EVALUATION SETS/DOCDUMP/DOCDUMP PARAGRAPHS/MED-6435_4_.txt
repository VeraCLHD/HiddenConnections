Serum total and specific IgE concentrations against aeroallergens and dietary allergens were determined. A questionnaire elicited information on symptoms, allergic diseases and medication. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with detectable IgE antibodies against aeroallergens increased consistently from the oldest to the youngest birth cohorts; chi2 trend=56.809, P<0.0001.
