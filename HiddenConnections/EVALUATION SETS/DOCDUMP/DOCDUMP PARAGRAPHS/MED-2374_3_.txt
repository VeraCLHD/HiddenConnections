Methods From the ongoing Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study, SCD cases (n=378) aged ≥35 years and with EKG-documented resting HR, were compared to 378 age- and gender-matched control subjects with coronary artery disease (68±13 years, 69% male). Associations with SCD were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results Mean resting HR was significantly higher among SCD cases compared to controls (7.5bpm difference, p<0.0001).
