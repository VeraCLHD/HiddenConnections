Formulations containing pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB; n=2) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D; n=1) were exposed to sunlight in quartz tubes, and the concentration of 93 PCDD/F congeners were monitored over time. Considerable formation of PCDD/Fs was observed in both PCNB formulations (by up to 5600%, to a maximum concentration of 57000 μg ∑PCDD/F kg(-1)) as well as the 2,4-D formulation (by 3000%, to 140 μg ∑PCDD/F kg(-1)). TEQ also increased by up to 980%, to a maximum concentration of 28 μg kg(-1) in PCNB, but did not change in the 2,4-D formulation.
