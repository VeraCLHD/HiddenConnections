Abstract Objective We examined the associations between sweets, sweetened and unsweetened beverages, and sugars and pancreatic cancer risk. Methods We conducted a population-based caseâ€“control study (532 cases, 1,701 controls) and used multivariate logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Because associations were often different by sex, we present results for men and women combined and separately.
