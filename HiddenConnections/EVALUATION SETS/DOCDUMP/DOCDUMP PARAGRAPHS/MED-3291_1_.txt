Several similar non-demented cases aged 85 to 105 years have been reported previously, who had neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe, but no deposition of amyloid plaques. Together with observations on other aging and very mild AD cases, these can be related to a model of aging and AD. In this model, tangles develop independently but relatively slowly during aging; these represent neurodegeneration, but by themselves may not represent AD.
