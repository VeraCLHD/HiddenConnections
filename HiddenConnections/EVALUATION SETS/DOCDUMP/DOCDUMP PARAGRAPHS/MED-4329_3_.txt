The optimal timing and mode of birth are the focus of current multicentre, randomised, controlled trials. However, the data from such trials on care for women with a multiple pregnancy are limited. Many areas of care require better-quality information, including when using assisted reproductive techniques, the optimal number of embryos to be transferred, care after the diagnosis of chorionicity, and the benefits of specialised multiple pregnancy clinics.
