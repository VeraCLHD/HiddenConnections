Feline calicivirus (FCV) was used as sample process control to validate the RNA extraction process, as a confirmation of the absence of sample inhibitors and as an amplification control. Using FCV/HEV multiplex TaqMan RT-qPCR system, HEV RNA was detected in 14 out of the 43 animals tested. HEV was detected in lymph nodes (11/43), bladder (10/43), liver (9/43), bile (8/43), faeces (6/43), tonsils (3/43), plasma (1/43) samples from infected animals.
