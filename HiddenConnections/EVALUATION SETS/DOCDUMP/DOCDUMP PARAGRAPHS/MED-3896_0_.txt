Abstract Context Exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides is common, and although these compounds have known neurotoxic properties, few studies examined risks for children in the general population. Objective To examine the association between the concentrations of urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OPs and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children age 8 to 15 years. Participants and Methods Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2000â€“2004) were available for 1,139 children representative of the general U.S. population.
