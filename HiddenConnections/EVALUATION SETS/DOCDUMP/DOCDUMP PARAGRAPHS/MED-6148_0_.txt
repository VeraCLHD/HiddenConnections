Abstract INTRODUCTION: The use of the penile peak systolic velocity (PSV) measured in the flaccid state during penile color Doppler ultrasound (PCDU) examination has been questioned without substantial evidence. AIM: To assess the validity of PSV measured in the flaccid state during PCDU, in patients consulting for erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: A consecutive series of 1,346 (mean age 55.0 +/- 12.0 years) male patients was studied.
