Abstract Sensory attributes of fully aged broiler breast fillets marinated in a 6% NaCl solution containing 2% sodium tripolyphosphate (2P), 2% citric acid (2C), 2% acetic acid (2A), 1% citric acid plus 1% phosphate solution (1C), or 1% acetic acid solution plus 1% phosphate (1A) were studied. A 6% NaCl (6S) solution with no additives was used as control. Oven-cooked samples (177C degrees oven; 75 degrees C internal temperature) were evaluated by a 9-member trained descriptive analysis sensory panel that rated the intensities of 26 different flavor and texture attributes using 15-point line scales.
