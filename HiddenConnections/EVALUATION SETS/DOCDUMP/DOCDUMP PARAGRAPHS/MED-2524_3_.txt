The proteins involving proliferative and apoptotic pathways were evaluated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: MTT assay revealed cell toxicity at more than 10(-5) mol/l for DEHP and at 10(-4) mol/l for both BBP and DBP in MCF-7 cells. Cell proliferation was significantly increased at 10(-8)-10(-5) mol/l of BBP and DBP, and at 10(-8)-10(-6) mol/l of DEHP treatment.
