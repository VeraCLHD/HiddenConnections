Logistic regression analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics showed that the occurrence of hypoalbuminemia or hyperkalemia was associated with low serum bicarbonate level and the presence of complications at baseline, but not with NEAP. CONCLUSION: In elderly CKD patients, our findings suggest that high NEAP is independently associated with CKD progression. The decrease in NEAP may be an effective kidney-protective therapy.
