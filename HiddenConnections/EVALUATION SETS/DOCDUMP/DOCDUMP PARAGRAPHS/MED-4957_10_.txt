Next, the authors performed a Phase I trial to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of a once-daily oral administration schedule. The indication was locally advanced uterine cervical carcinoma after definitive treatment. An escalating dose (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg per day) of bikunin was administered orally to nine patients for 7 days.
