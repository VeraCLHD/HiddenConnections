Previous epidemiological studies conducted to evaluate this hypothesis have not assessed all flavonoids, including classes that could contribute to intake among Americans, which would result in an underestimation of intake. This misclassification could mask variability among individuals, resulting in attenuated effect estimates for the association between flavonoids and cancer. To augment flavonoid and lignan intake estimates, we developed a database that can be used in conjunction with a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ).
