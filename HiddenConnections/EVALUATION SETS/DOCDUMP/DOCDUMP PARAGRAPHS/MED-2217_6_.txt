Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Carotid intima-media thickness, an indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis, was measured using B-mode ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean level of 25(OH)D3 was 31.8 ng/ml, and 47% (n=106) of the patients had insufficient 25(OH)D levels (<30 ng/ml).
