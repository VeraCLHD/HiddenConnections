Cox regression models for the bean-free diet showed an increased hazard ratio for all-cause mortality among women (1·98, 95% CI 1·03, 3·81) but not men (1·28, 95% CI 0·76, 2·16). CONCLUSIONS: A bean-free diet may play a role in developing the metabolic syndrome in both genders, and is a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in Taiwanese women but not men.
