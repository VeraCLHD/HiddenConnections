The in vivo plaque pH was measured with a touch microelectrode (Beetrode) prior to (baseline) and 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after consuming a test food or rinsing with a control solution. RESULTS: All test foods reduced plaque pH over the 30-minute period, with the largest reduction noted between 10 to 15 minutes. Consumption of cRB produced the largest pH drop compared to the other food groups at 10 minutes (P < .001).
