The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of YE in different production phases on swine farms. In this cross-sectional study, individual pigs on eight swine operations were sampled for the presence of YE. On each farm, both feces and oral-pharyngeal swabs were collected from pigs in five different production phases: gestating, farrowing, suckling, nursery, and finishing.
