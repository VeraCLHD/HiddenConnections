The CBF change in both regions correlated positively in the high-fat condition. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in hypothalamic activity and the interaction with the insular cortex elicited by fat may contribute to an efficient energy homeostasis. Therefore, fat might be a modulator of homeostatic and gustatory brain regions and their interaction.
