Abstract Context 2-[18F]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy) pyridine (2-F-A-85380, abbreviated as 2-FA) is a recently developed radioligand that allows for visualization of brain α4β2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in humans. Objective To determine the effect of cigarette smoking on α4β2* nAChR occupancy in tobacco-dependent smokers. Design Fourteen 2-FA PET scanning sessions were performed.
