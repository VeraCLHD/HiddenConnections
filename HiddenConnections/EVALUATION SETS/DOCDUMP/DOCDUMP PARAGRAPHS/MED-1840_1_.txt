It has been suggested that the decrease resulted from the mass cessation of estrogen-progestin hormone therapy (EPHT) in 2002. We took advantage of California's unique population-based cancer surveillance resources to assess whether regional changes in breast cancer incidence observed between 2001 and 2004 correlated with regional changes in EPHT use between 2001 and 2003. METHODS: We obtained statewide cancer registry and California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) EPHT data for almost 3 million non-Hispanic white women age 45 to 74 years, residing in California's 58 counties.
