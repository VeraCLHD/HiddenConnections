Abstract Dietary factors, including dietary fat, may affect the biological aging process, as reflected by the shortening of telomere length (TL), by affecting levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. We examined the direct relations of total and types of dietary fats and fat-rich foods to peripheral leukocyte TL. In 4029 apparently healthy postmenopausal women who participated in the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative, intakes of total fat, individual fatty acids, and fat-rich foods were assessed by a questionnaire.
