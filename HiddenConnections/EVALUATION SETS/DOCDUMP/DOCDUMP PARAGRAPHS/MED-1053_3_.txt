NP concentration was also significantly associated with the consumption of fish oil capsules (beta = 0.38, P < 0.01) and processed fish products (beta = 0.59, P < 0.01). The food pattern of cooking oil and processed meat products from factor analysis was strongly associated with OP concentration in human milk (P < 0.05). These determinations should aid in suggesting foods for consumption by nursing mothers in order to protect their infants from NP/OP exposure.
