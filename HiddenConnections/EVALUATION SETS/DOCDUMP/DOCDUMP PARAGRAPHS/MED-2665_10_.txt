Circulating LDL has a charge affinity for glycoaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane and further increases its permeability. Substantial amounts of filtered lipoprotein cause proliferation of mesangial cells. Proximal tubules reabsorb some of the filtered lipoprotein, and the remainder is altered during passage through the nephron.
