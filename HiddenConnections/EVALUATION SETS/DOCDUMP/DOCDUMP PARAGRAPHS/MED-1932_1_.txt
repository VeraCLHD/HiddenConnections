METHODS: This 12-year longitudinal study of a community-dwelling population in Japan included 15,948 examinations of 1962 men and 1990 women. We assessed appendicular muscle mass (AMM) using dual X-ray absorptiometry and calculated the skeletal muscle index (SMI) using the AMM divided by height squared (kg/m(2) ). Low muscle mass was defined as muscle mass minus two standard deviations below the mean for young healthy adults.
