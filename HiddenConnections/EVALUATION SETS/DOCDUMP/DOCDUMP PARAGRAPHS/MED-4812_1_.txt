Group I comprised children with chronic constipation and anal fissure in whom surgical causes were excluded, and group II comprised normal children. The daily consumption of cows milk, duration of breastfeeding and other clinical features of the children were investigated RESULTS: The mean daily consumption of cows milk was significantly higher in group I (756 mL, range 200-1500 mL) than group II (253 mL, range 0-1000 mL) (P < 0.001).
