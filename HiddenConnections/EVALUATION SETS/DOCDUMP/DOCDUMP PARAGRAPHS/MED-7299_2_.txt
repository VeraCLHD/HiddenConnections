Amines were extracted with 0.4M perchloric acid and derivatized with dansyl chloride. Nine biogenic amines were separated from Doenjang samples by high performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution (acetonitrile and ammonium acetate), and detected with spectrophotometric UV-vis detection at 254 nm. The pH value of all the samples was ranged from 4.8 to 6.0, and the strong amino acid decarboxylase activity was found to be in an acidic environment.
