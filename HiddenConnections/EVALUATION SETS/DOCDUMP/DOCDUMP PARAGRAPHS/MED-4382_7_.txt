Two-way analysis of variance showed a significant group effect and interaction in CFVR before and after beverage consumption (p = 0.001). CFVR significantly increased after tea consumption in group T (4.5 +/- 0.9 vs 5.2 +/- 0.9, p <0.0001). The CFVR ratio of group T was larger than that of group C (1.18 +/- 0.07 vs 1.04 +/- 0.08, p = 0.002).
