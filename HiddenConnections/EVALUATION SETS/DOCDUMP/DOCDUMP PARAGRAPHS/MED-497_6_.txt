The combination of gemcitabine and TF was synergistic with IC90 levels achieved in both pancreatic cancer cell lines at lower concentrations. CalcuSyn analysis of cytotoxicity data showed that the Gemcitabine + Turmeric Force combination has strong synergism with combination index (CI) values of 0.050 and 0.183 in BxPC3 and Panc-1 lines, respectively at IC50 level. This synergistic effect is due to the increased inhibitory effect of the combination on nuclear factor-kappaB activity and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 expression as compared to the single agent.
