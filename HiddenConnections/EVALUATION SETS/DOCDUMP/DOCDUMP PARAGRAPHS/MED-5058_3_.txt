The gap in life expectancy between aborigines and the general population was analysed by decomposing these gaps according to major causes of deaths. This analysis quantifies the contribution of different causes of deaths to the gap in life expectancy between the two populations. RESULTS: The overall mortality of aborigines in these townships was approximately 70% higher than the respective male and female general populations over the past 30 years.
