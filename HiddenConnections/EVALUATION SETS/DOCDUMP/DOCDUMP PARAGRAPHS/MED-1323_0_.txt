Abstract Infection with pork tapeworm, or Taenia solium, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. The most important and potentially devastating form of the infestation, neurocysticercosis, occurs when the parasite invades the central nervous system. There has been a significant increase in the number of cases in the United States due to immigration from endemic areas.
