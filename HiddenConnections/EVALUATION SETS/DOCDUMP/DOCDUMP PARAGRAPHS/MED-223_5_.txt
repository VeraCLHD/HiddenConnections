IMCL was quantified by (1)H-MRS in soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle at baseline and then every hour. IMCL levels started to increase significantly after 2 h, reaching a maximum of 120.8 +/- 3.4% (SOL) and 164.2 +/- 13.8% (TA) of baseline after 6 h (both P < 0.05). In parallel, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) decreased progressively, reaching a minimum of 60.4 +/- 5.4% of baseline after 6 h. Over time, the GIR was strongly correlated with IMCL in TA (r = -0.98, P < or = 0.003) and SOL muscle (r = -0.97, P < or = 0.005).
