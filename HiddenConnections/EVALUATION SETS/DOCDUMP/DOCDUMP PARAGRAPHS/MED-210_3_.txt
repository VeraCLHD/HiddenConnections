A cohort of 1,730 employed white men ages 40–55 years from the Chicago Western Electric Study was followed from 1958 to 1966. Diet was assessed twice with Burke’s comprehensive diet history method, at two baseline examinations; height, weight, and other covariates were measured annually by trained interviewers. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to examine the relation of baseline total, animal, and vegetable protein intake to likelihood of being overweight or obese at sequential annual examinations.
