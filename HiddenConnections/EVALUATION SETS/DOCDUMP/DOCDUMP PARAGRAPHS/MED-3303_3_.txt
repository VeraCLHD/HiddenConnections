At 37 weeks, she developed polyhydramnios; a fetal echocardiogram showed right atrial and ventricular (RV) enlargement with RV dysfunction. Immediately after birth, there was pulmonary hypertension by echocardiogram with DA closure, severe RV hypertrophy and dysfunction, and marked right-to-left atrial shunting. Improvement occurred over 3 weeks with the neonate tolerating room air and a follow-up echocardiogram showing minimal atrial shunting and improved RV function.
