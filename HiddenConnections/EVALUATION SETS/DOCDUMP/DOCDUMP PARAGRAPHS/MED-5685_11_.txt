There were no significant changes in blood pressures or lipid profiles. On multivariate analysis, changes in B-12 (Î²=0.25; p=0.02) but not homocysteine were related to changes in FMD, (R=0.32; F value=3.19; p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin B-12 supplementation improved arterial function in vegetarians with subnormal vitamin B-12 levels, proposing a novel strategy for atherosclerosis prevention.
