STUDY DESIGN: In that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) has been found to be elevated in cows selected for their demonstrated increased twinning rate, the effect of agents that influence the level of IGF in women was examined. This was correlated with their prior history of singleton versus twin birthing. In particular, the effect of diets consisting of or excluding animal products that have elevated IGF content (e.g., milk) was considered.
