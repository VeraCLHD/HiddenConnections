In the present study, the induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity by curcumin in colon cancer colo 205 cells was investigated by using flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that curcumin induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis dose- and time-depedently. Curcumin induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca+2, decreased the levels of mitochondria membrane potential and induced caspase-3 activity.
