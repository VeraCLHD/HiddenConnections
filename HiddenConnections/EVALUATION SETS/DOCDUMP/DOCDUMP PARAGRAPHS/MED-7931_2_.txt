Results: Weight by DXA did not change between groups (+1.38 ± 2.02 kg for placebo vs. +0.756 ± 1.32 kg for soy, p=0.48, means ± S.D.). Total and subcutaneous abdominal fat increased more in the placebo compared to the soy group (for differences between groups in total abdominal fat: +38.62 ± 22.84 cm2 for placebo vs. −11.86 ± 31.48 cm2 for soy, p=0.005; subcutaneous abdominal fat: +22.91 ± 28.58 cm2 for placebo vs. −14.73 ± 22.26 cm2 for soy, p=0.013). Insulin secretion, visceral fat, total body fat, and lean mass did not differ between groups.
