Blood pressure was measured using a semiautomated device (Omron 705), and the reduction in mean arterial pressure with the combined preparation was compared with that of the individual components. Statistical analysis used ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer honestly significant difference for multiple comparisons. The reduction in mean arterial pressure with the combination (19+/-2 mm Hg) was significantly greater than that with individual agents amlodipine (10+/-2 mm Hg; P<0.005), atenolol (10+/-2 mm Hg; P<0.005), bendroflumethiazide (6+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.005), and captopril (11+/-1 mm Hg; P<0.01).
