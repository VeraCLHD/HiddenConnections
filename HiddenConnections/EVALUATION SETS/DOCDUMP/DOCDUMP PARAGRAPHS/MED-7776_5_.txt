RESULTS: A total of 28.8% children were reported to have constipation. Median dietary fibre intake of constipated children was significantly lower than non-constipated children (3.4 g/d (inter-quartile range (IQR): 2.3-4.6 g/d) vs. 3.8 g/d (IQR: 2.7-4.9 g/d); P = 0.044) corresponding to 40% reference dietary fibre intake. Constipated children also had significantly lower intakes of vitamin C (P = 0.041), folate (P = 0.043) and magnesium (P = 0.002).
