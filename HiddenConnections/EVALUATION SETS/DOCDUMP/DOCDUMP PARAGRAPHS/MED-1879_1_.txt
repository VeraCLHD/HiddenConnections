We hypothesize that iodine supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk for iodine deficiency. METHODS: Cross-sectional study to assess iodine levels in random urine specimens during pregnancy in New York City. One hundred eighty-two women visited a clinic where free iodine supplementation was offered (150 Î¼g of potassium iodide daily; Group A), and 183 women were seen at a practice at which no supplementation was offered (Group B).
