RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-seven physicians (34%) responded representing 174 (87%) of the 198 member institutions. More than half of respondents (57%) report implementing the neutropenic diet at their facility. In a multivariate analysis, being a stem cell transplant (SCT) center was the only significant factor associated with implementing a neutropenic diet (OR: 6.06, 95% CI, 2.88-12.738, P < 0.001) after controlling for years in practice, gender, center size, and academic versus private practice.
