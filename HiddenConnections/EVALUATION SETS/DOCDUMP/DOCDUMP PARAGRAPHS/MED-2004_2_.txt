Increases in cortisol, of a smaller magnitude, were also seen after both the 1200 and 1600 hr meals in each of the diets with 1 gm protein/kg body weight (standard, high fat, high carbohydrate). ACTH was significantly increased following the 1200 hr and 1600 hr meals with the high protein diet. We conclude that dietary protein plays an important role in meal stimulated cortisol release.
