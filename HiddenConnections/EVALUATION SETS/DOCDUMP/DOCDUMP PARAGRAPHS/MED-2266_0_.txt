Abstract Background: The frequency of soda consumption remains high in the United States. Soda consumption has been associated with poor bone health in children, but few studies have examined this relation in adults, and to our knowledge, no study has examined the relation of soda consumption with risk of hip fractures. Objective: We examined the association of soda, including specific types of soda, and risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women.
