Patients carrying mutations in these molecules or in hepcidin itself develop systemic iron loading (or hemochromatosis) due to their inability to down regulate iron absorption. Hepcidin is also responsible for the decreased plasma iron or hypoferremia that accompanies inflammation and various chronic diseases as its expression is stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of hepcidin expression and how it acts on cells to control iron release are key areas of ongoing research.
