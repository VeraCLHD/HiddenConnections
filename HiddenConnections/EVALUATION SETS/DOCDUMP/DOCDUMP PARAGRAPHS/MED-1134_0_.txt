Abstract To prevent or delay the occurrence of chronic diseases, scientific bodies from the cardiologic and oncologic disciplines have made recommendations regarding the daily dietary intake of certain macro- and micronutrients. This study assessed the knowledge of a random population of 2,305 individuals comprising members of the public, health care workers, university graduate students, and health club attendees. Segments of this population might be expected to have a greater understanding and ability to implement these dietary recommendations.
