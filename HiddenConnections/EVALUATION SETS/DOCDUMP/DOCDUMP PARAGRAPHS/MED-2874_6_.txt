Results Higher NEAP was associated with lower serum bicarbonate in a graded fashion (P trend < 0.001). Serum bicarbonate was 1.27 mEq/L lower among those in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of NEAP (P < 0.001). There was a greater difference in serum bicarbonate between the highest and lowest quartiles of NEAP among patients with stage 4/5 CKD (−2.43 mEq/L, P < 0.001) compared with those with stage 2/3 disease (−0.77 mEq/L, P = 0.01; P-interaction = 0.02).
