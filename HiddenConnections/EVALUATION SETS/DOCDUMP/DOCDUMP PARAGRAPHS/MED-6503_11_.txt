Although carbohydrates, sugar, and fat were associated with lower price per 100 g, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals were associated with higher price per 100 g, after adjustment for energy.

These price differentials may help to explain why low-cost, energy-dense foods that are nutrient poor are associated with lower education and incomes.
