The average body burden from the surveys in the mid-1990s was 22.9 pg TEQ/g lipid weight (pg/g lwt). More recent blood concentration data, from NHANES 2001/2, suggest an adult average at 21.7 pg/g TEQ lwt. These TEQ values include the 17 dioxin and furan congeners and 3 coplanar PCBs, and were generated substituting ND=(1/2)DL or ND=DL/sq rt (2).
