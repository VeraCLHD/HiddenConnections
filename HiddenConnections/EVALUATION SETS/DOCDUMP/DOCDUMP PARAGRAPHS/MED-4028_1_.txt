Analysis of 30 flour samples processed from the endosperm of Cycas circinalis seeds collected on Guam indicated that more than 87% of the total BMAA content was removed during processing. Furthermore, in 1/2 the samples almost all (greater than 99%) of the total BMAA was removed. We found no significant regional differences in the BMAA content of flour prepared from cycad seeds collected from several villages on Guam.
