Many bidirectional interactions of the gut microbiota, including with food, bile and the intestinal epithelium, have been identified. These interactions might contribute to the distinct steps in the progression from lean to obese states, and to steatosis, steatohepatitis and eventually fibrosis. The predominant steps are efficient caloric extraction from the diet, intestinal epithelial damage and greater entry of bacterial components into the portal circulation.
