Abstract This pilot study examined the relationships of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with prostate cancer. Ninety-nine controls were frequency matched by age in 5-year increments to 58 prostate cancer patients. Thirty PCBs and 18 OCPs were measured in serum by gas chromatography.
