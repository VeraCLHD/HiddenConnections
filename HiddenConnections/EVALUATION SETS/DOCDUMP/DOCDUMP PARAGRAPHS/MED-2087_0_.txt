Abstract BACKGROUND: The effect of salt reduction on vascular function, assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the effects of a low-salt (LS; 50 mmol Na/d) diet with those of a usual-salt (US; 150 mmol Na/d) diet on FMD. DESIGN: This was a randomized crossover design in which 29 overweight and obese normotensive men and women followed an LS diet and a US diet for 2 wk.
