Abstract Background/Objectives Extrinsic phytosterols supplemented to the diet reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption and plasma LDL-cholesterol. However, little is known about their effects on cholesterol metabolism when given in native, unpurified form and in amounts achievable in the diet. The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that intrinsic phytosterols present in unmodified foods alter whole-body cholesterol metabolism.
