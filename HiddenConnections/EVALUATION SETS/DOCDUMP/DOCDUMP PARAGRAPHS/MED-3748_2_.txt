MATERIALS AND METHODS: On the basis of a dietary questionnaire administered to a sample of 75 renal stone formers living in the urban area of Milan (Northern Italy), we selected the most frequently reported foods for each of 11 categories: grains, meats, cured meats, eggs, cheeses, legumes, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and juices, milk and dairies and bread. The PRAL per 100 g of each food was calculated considering its mineral and protein composition, the mean intestinal absorption rate for each nutrient and the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids. The PRAL/100 g of each main food category was then calculated considering the frequency of the most represented (up to six) foods in the respective food group and the PRAL/100 g of each food.
