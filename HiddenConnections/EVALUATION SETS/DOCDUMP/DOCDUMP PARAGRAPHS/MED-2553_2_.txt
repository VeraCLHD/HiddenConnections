For biomonitoring of short-term and long-term exposure, analytical methods were established for determination of myosmine together with nicotine and cotinine in plasma, saliva and toenail by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Validation of the method with samples of 14 smokers and 10 non-smokers showed smoking-dependent differences of myosmine in toenails (66 +/- 56 vs 21 +/- 15 ng g(-1), p <0.01) as well as saliva (2.54 +/- 2.68 vs 0.73 +/- 0.65 ng ml(-1), p <0.01). However, these differences were much smaller than those with nicotine (1971 +/- 818 vs 132 +/- 82 ng g(-1), p <0.0001) and cotinine (1237 +/- 818 vs <35 ng g(-1)) in toenail and those of cotinine (97.43 +/- 84.54 vs 1.85 +/- 4.50 ng ml(-1), p <0.0001) in saliva.
