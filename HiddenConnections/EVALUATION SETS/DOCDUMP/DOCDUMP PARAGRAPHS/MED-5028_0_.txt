Abstract COX-1 and COX-2 are two cyclooxygenase enzymes responsible for prostanoid production. COX-2 is expressed in inflammatory cells and fibroblasts of the gastric mucosa, and through the production of various growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plays a key role in the tissue repair process. Aspirin induces and acetylates COX-2 to produce 15-(R)-epi-lipoxinA4, an anti-inflammatory mediator thought to protect the gastric mucosa against aspirin-induced injury.
