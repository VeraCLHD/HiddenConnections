Pre- and postsupplementation, UVR erythemal sensitivity was assessed visually as the minimal erythema dose (MED) and quantified with a reflectance instrument. Biopsies were taken from unexposed and UVR-exposed (3 × MED 24 h earlier) buttock skin pre- and postsupplementation, and analysed immunohistochemically for procollagen (pC) I, fibrillin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for mtDNA 3895-bp deletion. RESULTS: Mean ± SD erythemal D(30) was significantly higher following tomato paste vs. control (baseline, 26·5 ± 7·5 mJ cm(-2); control, 23 ± 6·6 mJ cm(-2); tomato paste, 36·6 ± 14·7 mJ cm(-2); P = 0·03), while the MED was not significantly different between groups (baseline, 35·1 ± 9·9 mJ cm(-2); control, 32·6 ± 9·6 mJ cm(-2); tomato paste, 42·2 ± 11·3 mJ cm(-2)).
