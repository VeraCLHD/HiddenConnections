The total analysis time for the assay was less than 15 min. Initially, the biosensor performance was tested in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) using B394, B131 and B4 biosensors. The best detection limits were obtained with B394; therefore, this biosensor was used to produce calibration data in milk with three OPs in the concentration range of 5 × 10(-6)M to 5 × 10(-12)M.
