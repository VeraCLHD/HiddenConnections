After oral administration of beetroot extract to rats the betacyanin content of the stomach decreased rapidly with time but neither the intestines nor the bile duct were stained visibly red. These findings together with those showing instability of the betacyanins in acid conditions suggest that variability in the biological fate of beetroot pigments may be determined largely by gastric pH and emptying rate.
