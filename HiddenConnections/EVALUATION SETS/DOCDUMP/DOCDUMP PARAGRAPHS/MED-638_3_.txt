In one-month metabolic diets, 24 hyperlipidemic subjects consumed breads providing an additional 19 g/d dietary fiber as medium or ultra-fine wheat bran and extra protein (10% of energy as wheat gluten). In two-week ad libitum diets, 24 predominantly normolipidemic subjects consumed breakfast cereals providing an additional 19 g/d of dietary fiber as coarse or a mixture of ultra-fine and coarse wheat bran with no change in gluten intake. Both studies followed a randomized crossover design with control periods when subjects ate low-fiber breads and cereals respectively with no added gluten.
