People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease develop the so called "hypoxic neuropathy" in which similar microvascular changes occur as in diabetic neuropathy. In rats with experimental diabetic neuropathy nerve blood flow is reduced and oxygen supplementation or vasodilator treatment improved the deterioration in conduction velocity and nerve blood flow. Similarly, in human diabetic neuropathy, there is impaired nerve blood flow, epineurial arterio-venous shunting and a reduction in sural nerve oxygen tension.
