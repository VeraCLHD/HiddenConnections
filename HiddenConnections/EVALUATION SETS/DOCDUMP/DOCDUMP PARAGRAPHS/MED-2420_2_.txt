All of the epidemiological studies that assessed dietary intake of citrus fruits and presented risk estimates of the association between citrus fruits intake and risk of breast cancer were reviewed. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for highest versus lowest intake of dietary citrus fruits level were extracted. Overall summary OR was calculated by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis.
