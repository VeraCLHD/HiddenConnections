Dose-response analysis showed that every 10-g/d increment in dietary fiber intake was associated with a significant 7% reduction in breast cancer risk. Little evidence of publication bias was found. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides evidence of a significant inverse dose-response association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk.
