The mean time to onset was 21.6 +/- 15.0 seconds, and the effect continued for at least 20 minutes. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, efficacy was significantly lower (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The intraluminal administration of peppermint oil by using a hand pump is a simple, safe, and convenient alternative to the systemic injection of a cholinergic blocking agent or glucagon during colonoscopy.
