Among the parameters determining metabolic syndrome, an increasing visceral fat area had the strongest association with PTX3 concentrations. Conclusion In patients with STEMI, PTX3 is associated with central obesity and it is significantly and independently correlated with visceral fat area. FAT-CT-estimated visceral fat area is the most reliable factor associated with serum PTX3 levels in patients with STEMI and central obesity.
