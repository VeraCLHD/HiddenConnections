With any degree of increase in age or SBP, PWV increased less in the garlic group than in the control group (P<.0001). ANCOVA and multiple regression analyses demonstrated that age and SBP were the most important determinants of PWV and that the effect of garlic on PWV was independent of confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic garlic powder intake attenuated age-related increases in aortic stiffness.
