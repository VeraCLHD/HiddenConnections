One half of the subjects received 15% of energy as cocoa butter, and one half received 15% of energy as corn oil. A meal containing (54)Mn was fed after 4 wk, and subjects underwent whole-body counting for the next 21 d. Blood draws and neuropsychological tests were administered at regular intervals during the dietary periods. When subjects consumed the diets low in Mn, compared with the high Mn diets, they absorbed a significantly higher percentage of (54)Mn, but had a significantly longer biological half-life of the absorbed (54)Mn.
