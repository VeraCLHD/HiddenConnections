After adjusting for confounding factors, we found that insulin resistance increased with serum dioxins (b = 0.13, P < 0.001) and blood mercury (b = 0.01, P < 0.001). Moreover, participants with higher serum dioxins or blood mercury were at a significantly increasing risk for insulin resistance (P(trend) < 0.001). The joint highest tertile of serum dioxins and blood mercury was associated with elevated HOMA-IR at 11 times the odds of the joint lowest tertile (AOR 11.00, 95% CI: 4.87, 26.63).
