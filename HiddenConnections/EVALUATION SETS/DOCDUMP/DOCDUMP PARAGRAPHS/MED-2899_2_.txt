Therefore, an assessment of thyroid function over 4 years was undertaken in a subset of individuals in a randomised, placebo controlled clinical trial comparing the effects of 0.3% triclosan toothpaste with placebo toothpaste in subjects with coronary heart disease. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), antithyroglobulin antibody (anti-TGab) and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOab) were measured. Paired serum samples at year 1 and year 5 from 132 subjects (64 triclosan group, 68 placebo group) were analysed.
