In an earlier study the lowest excretion of enterolactone (1,040 nmol/24 h) was found in a group of postmenopausal apparently healthy breast cancer patients living in Boston. It is concluded that further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible role of these compounds in cancer and other diseases. However, the evidence obtained until now seems to justify the conclusion that these compounds may be among the dietary factors affording protection against hormone-dependent cancers in vegetarians and semivegetarians.
