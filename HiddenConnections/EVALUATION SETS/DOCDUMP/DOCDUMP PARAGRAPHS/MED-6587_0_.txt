Abstract Phytoestrogens are polyphenolic secondary plant metabolites that have structural and functional similarities to 17beta-oestradiol and have been associated with a protective effect against hormone-related cancers. Most foods in the UK only contain small amounts of phytoestrogens (median content 21 microg/100 g) and the highest content is found in soya and soya-containing foods. The highest phytoestrogen content in commonly consumed foods is found in breads (average content 450 microg/100 g), the main source of isoflavones in the UK diet.
