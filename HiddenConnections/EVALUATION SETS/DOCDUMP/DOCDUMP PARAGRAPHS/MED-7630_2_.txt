The phenolic compound composition and antioxidant properties of 21 selected apple genotypes were evaluated. The lipid stabilizing ability of the apple skin extracts was examined using an aqueous emulsion system of methyl linolenate. The total phenolic concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of methanolic extracts of skins of the apple genotypes varied from 150 to 700 mg/100 g DW.
