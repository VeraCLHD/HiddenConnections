LIMITATION: Most trials focused on surrogate measures (such as weight change, blood pressure, and lipids) for which clinical relevance was unclear. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive lifestyle interventions effectively decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes in high-risk patients. In patients who already have type 2 diabetes, there is no evidence of reduced all-cause mortality and insufficient evidence to suggest benefit on cardiovascular and microvascular outcomes.
