Methods: Participants were 3,779 members of the Swedish Twin Registry who completed a diet questionnaire approximately 30 years prior to cognitive screening and full clinical evaluation for dementia as part of the HARMONY study. Among the participants, 355 twins were diagnosed with dementia. Among these, 81 twin pairs were discordant for dementia (50 discordant for AD).
