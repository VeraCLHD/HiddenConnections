Venipunctures and ultrasound measurements of brachial artery endothelial function were performed after fasting and 4 h after test meals. RESULTS: In both study groups, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was worse after the olive oil meal than after the walnut meal (p = 0.006, time-period interaction). Fasting, but not postprandial, triglyceride concentrations correlated inversely with FMD (r = -0.324; p = 0.024).
