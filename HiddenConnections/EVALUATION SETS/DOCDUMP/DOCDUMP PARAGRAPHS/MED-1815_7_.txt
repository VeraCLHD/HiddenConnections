The GM-WM ratio decreased exponentially from early childhood through the 4th decade; thereafter, it gradually declined. In vivo patterns of change in the intracranial space, whole brain, and GM-WM ratio agreed with published postmortem data. CONCLUSION: MR images accurately depict normal patterns of age-related change in intracranial space, whole brain, GM, WM, and CSF.
