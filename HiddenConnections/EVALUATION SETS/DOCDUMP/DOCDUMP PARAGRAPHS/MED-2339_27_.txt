The endoscopic index (EI) at six months was significantly lower in the curcumin group than in the placebo group (0.8 ± 0.6 versus 1.6 ± 1.6; MD −0.80, 95% CI −1.33 to −0.27). Authors’ conclusions Curcumin may be a safe and effective therapy for maintenance of remission in quiescent UC when given as adjunctive therapy along with mesalamine or sulfasalazine. However, further research in the form of a large scale methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm any possible benefit of curcumin in quiescent UC.
