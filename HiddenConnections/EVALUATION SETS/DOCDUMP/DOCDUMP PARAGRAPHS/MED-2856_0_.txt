Abstract Design ACCORD is a parallel group, randomized trial designed to investigate whether intensive glycemic therapy with a target HbA1c of <6.0% versus standard therapy with a target of 7.0 to 7.9% reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity, mortality, and microvascular complications in participants with type 2 diabetes. Methods Volunteers with established type 2 diabetes, HbA1c levels â‰¥ 7.5% and CVD or two or more CVD risk factors were recruited at 77 clinical sites across the U.S. and Canada. Instructional materials, behavioral counseling, glucose-lowering medications and self-monitoring supplies were provided by the study.
