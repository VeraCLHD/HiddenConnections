Abstract The effect of a fat-containing meal on plasma sex steroid concentrations was investigated in normal men. After an overnight fast on two separate occasions, subjects ingested a liquid meal containing either a nonnutritive sweetener (control), or isocaloric meals of mixed calorie sources with either high-fat content or mixed carbohydrate and protein with minimal fat. The order of the meals was alternated.
