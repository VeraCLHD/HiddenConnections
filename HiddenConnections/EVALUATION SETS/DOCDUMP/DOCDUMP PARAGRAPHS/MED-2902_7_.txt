This review will reveal how many modern therapies and western lifestyles actually lead to a decrease in NO homeostasis in patients, from pediatrics to geriatrics. The findings outlined here highlight why nitric oxide homeostasis should be accounted for and considered in the treatment of patients and in the development of new therapies. Understanding NO homeostasis in each patient and how treatments and procedures affect NO homeostasis should allow for better medical care and improved outcomes.
