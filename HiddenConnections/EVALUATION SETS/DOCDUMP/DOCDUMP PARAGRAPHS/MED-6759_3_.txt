RESULTS: Caries risk in the permanent teeth was associated with social disadvantage and diet. Among the dietary factors, the frequency of fruit consumption was associated with higher odds of caries experience (odds ratio: 1.52, 95% confidence intervals: 1.05, 2.21). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to a high level of fruit consumption was suggestive of increased caries risk.
