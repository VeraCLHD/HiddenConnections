When cells are injured, such as in muscle foods after slaughtering, lipid peroxidation is favored, and traces of O(2) and H(2)O(2), indicating lipid peroxides, are formed. The stability of a muscle food product will depend on the 'tone' of these peroxides and especially from the involvement of metal ions in the process. The cytosol contains not only prooxidants but also antioxidants and the tone of both affects the overall oxidation.
