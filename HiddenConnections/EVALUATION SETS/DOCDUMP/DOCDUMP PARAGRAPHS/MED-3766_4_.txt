Most notably, there was a parasite centered in the reticular dermis with prominent lateral chords, a well-developed muscular esophagus, and an intestine that contained a brush border and multinucleate cells. Evaluation of these histological sections by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the parasite to be a nematode of the genus Gnathostoma. The patient underwent a systemic work-up for gnathostomiasis, including imaging, and no other abnormalities were found.
