In the second three-week treatment period, the eight subjects who first received placebo were given active capsules, and the seven who first received active capsules were given placebo. Night VA and night CS was tested throughout the three-month experiment. RESULTS: There was no difference in night VA during any of the measurement periods when examining the average night VA or the last night VA measurement during active and placebo treatments.
