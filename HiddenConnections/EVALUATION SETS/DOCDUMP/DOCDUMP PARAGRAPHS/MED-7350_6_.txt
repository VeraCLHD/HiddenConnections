CONCLUSIONS: MRSA contamination of retail meat is not uncommon. While CMRSA-2, a human epidemic clone, has been found in pigs in Canada, the lack of isolation of livestock-associated ST398 was surprising. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The relevance of MRSA contamination of meat is unclear but investigation is required because of the potential for exposure from food handling.
