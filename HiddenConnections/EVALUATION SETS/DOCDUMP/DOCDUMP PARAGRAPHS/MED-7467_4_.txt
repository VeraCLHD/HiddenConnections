Blood samples were taken during 120 min for analysis of glucose and insulin. Satiety was measured with a subjective rating scale. RESULTS: A significant dose-response relation was seen at 30 min for blood glucose and serum insulin responses; the higher the acetic acid level, the lower the metabolic responses.
