Those examining effects of RS on colonic biology and biomarkers for CRC confirm and extend the results in humans. RS modifies the lumenal environment, largely through altered fermentation of polysaccharides and proteins. RS also affects epithelial biology in that it increases apoptotic deletion of genetically damaged cells.
