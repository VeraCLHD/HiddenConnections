Abstract Arachidonic acid is normally stored in membrane-bound phospholipids and released by the action of phospholipases. Enzymatic conversion of released arachidonic acid into biologically active derivatives proceeds through one of several routes. Cyclo-oxygenase converts arachidonic acid to unstable cyclic endoperoxides from which prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes are derived.
