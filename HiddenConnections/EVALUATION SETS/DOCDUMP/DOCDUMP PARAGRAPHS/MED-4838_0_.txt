Abstract In this study, genotoxicity of two mouthwash products (chlorexidin, benzidamine-HCl) were investigated in the Drosophila Wing-Spot Test which makes use of the wing cell markers multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare (flr) and detects both mitotic recombination and various types of mutational events. Induced mutations are detected as single mosaic spots on the wing blade of surviving adults that show either the multiple wing hairs or flare phenotype. Induced recombination leads to mwh and flr twin spots and also, to some extent, to mwh single spots.
