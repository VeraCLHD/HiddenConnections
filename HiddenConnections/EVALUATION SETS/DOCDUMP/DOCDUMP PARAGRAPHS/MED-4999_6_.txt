While certain covariates were significantly associated with Cd by subpopulation (creatinine; age; BMI; race/ethnicity/origin; education; smokers in the home; serum cotinine; 24-h fat, Mg, Fe intakes; use of dietary supplements), they did not help explain the declines. Instead, unidentified time-related factors appeared responsible. Despite the declines, millions of Americans remain potentially at risk of adverse outcomes associated with low-level Cd exposure.
