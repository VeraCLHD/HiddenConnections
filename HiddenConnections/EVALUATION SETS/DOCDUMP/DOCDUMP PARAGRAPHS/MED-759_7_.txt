There was no significant correlation between amount of caffeine intake and disease duration (Spearman's r=0.194; p=0.202) or total tremor score (Spearman's r=0.045; p=0.771) in ET patients. CONCLUSION: Caffeine consumption was not associated with risk of ET in our study population. Further studies are needed to investigate the significance of gene-environmental interaction in ET.
