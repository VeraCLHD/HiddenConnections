At sensitivity analysis, results were not influenced by concomitant background therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic patients with chronic CAD, R, added to conventional therapy, effectively reduces angina frequency and sublingual nitroglycerin consumption while prolonging exercise duration as well as time to onset of ischemia and to onset of angina with no substantial effects on blood pressure and heart rate.
