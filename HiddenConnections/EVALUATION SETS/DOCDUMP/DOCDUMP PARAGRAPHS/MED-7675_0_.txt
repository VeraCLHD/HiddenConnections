Abstract Tumor metastasis is the most important cause of cancer death and various treatment strategies have targeted on preventing the occurrence of metastasis. Anthocyanins are natural colorants belonging to the flavonoid family, and are wildly used for their antioxidant properties. Here, we provided molecular evidence associated with the anti-metastatic effects of peonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside, major anthocyanins extracted from black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica), by showing a marked inhibition on the invasion and motility of SKHep-1 cells.
