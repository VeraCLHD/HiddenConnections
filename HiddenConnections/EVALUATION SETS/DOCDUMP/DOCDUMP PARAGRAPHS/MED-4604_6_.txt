RESULTS: Well known periodontal risk factors like age, gender and smoking habits were equally distributed within each group (71 females, 29 males, respectively and 10 smokers in each group; mean age: 41.45 years vegetarians versus 41.72 years non-vegetarians). Vegetarians had significantly lower probing pocket depths (P=0.039), bleeding on probing (P=0.001), periodontal screening index (P=0.012), a better hygiene index (P<0.001) and less mobile teeth (P=0.013). Dental examinations revealed significantly less missing teeth (P=0.018) but also more decayed (P=0.001) and eroded (P=0.026) teeth in vegetarians.
