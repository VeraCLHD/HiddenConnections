As it is important to identify modifiable risk factors that may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the aim of the present study was to determine the association between egg consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: A specifically designed questionnaire was used to collect information on possible risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
