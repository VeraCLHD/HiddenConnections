The semen quality of 2 groups of men with idiopathic infertility, smokers (n = 118) and nonsmokers (n = 153), were compared. Conventional semen analysis was performed and sperm morphology was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM data were elaborated by means of a mathematical formula based on a Bayesian technique able to furnish a fertility index (FI), and the percentages of sperm apoptosis, necrosis, and immaturity.
