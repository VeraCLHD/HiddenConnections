Summary Objectives The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Figitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody against IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Methods This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov: {"type":"clinical-trial","attrs":{"text":"NCT00603538","term_id":"NCT00603538"}}NCT00603538) assessed the safety and tolerability of figitumumab (6, 10 and 20 mg/kg) in combination with carboplatin (area under the curve: 6 mg·min/mL) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) in Japanese patients (N = 19) with chemotherapy-naïve, advanced NSCLC.
