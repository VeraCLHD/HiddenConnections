The process of carcinogenesis is dissected into its constituent steps, thereby exposing sites for intervention. These sites are then critically discussed with regard to the existence of chemicals active at these sites using data gained from the laboratory and from epidemiological studies, intrinsic problems or advantages associated with intervention at specific sites in the carcinogenic process, and practical aspects of intervention in humans. The design and potential long-term positive and negative consequences of chemoprevention clinical trials are critically discussed, with the objective of exposing the major differences that exist between clinical trials in cancer chemoprevention and those in cancer chemotherapy.
