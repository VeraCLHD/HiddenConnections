We here summarize data reported over the years concerning the involvement of SHBG and SHBG polymorphisms in the definition of breast cancer risk. We also report what is known about the direct action of SHBG in breast cancer cells, illustrating its interaction with these cells and the subsequent initiation of a specific intracellular pathway leading to cross-talk with the estradiol-activated pathway and, finally, to the inhibition of several effects of estradiol in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, as a result of its unique property of regulating the estrogen free fraction and cross-talking with the estradiol pathways, by inhibiting estradiol-induced breast cancer cell growth and proliferation, SHBG is associated with a reduced risk of developing the neoplasm after estrogen exposure.
