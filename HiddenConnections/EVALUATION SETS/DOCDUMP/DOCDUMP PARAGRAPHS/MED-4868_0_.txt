Abstract OBJECTIVE: To clarify the hormonal context of breast cancer etiology we used data from a large, population-based case-control study to investigate the relationship between breast cancer risk and a history of diabetes mellitus, disorders associated with estrogen stimulation (uterine fibroids, endometriosis, gallstones), and disorders associated with androgen stimulation (acne, hirsutism, and polycystic ovaries). METHODS: Breast cancer patients between 50 and 75 years old were identified from state-wide tumor registries in Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire; controls were randomly selected from drivers' license lists (age less than 65) or Medicare enrollment files (age 65-74). Information on reproductive history, medical history, and personal habits was obtained by telephone interview.
