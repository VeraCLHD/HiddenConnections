Endothelial function improved by ~20% (p<0.001) and arterial stiffness was reduced by 0.59m/s (0.24-0.93;p<0.01) after dietary nitrate consumption with no change after placebo. The intervention was well tolerated. This is the first evidence of durable blood pressure reduction with dietary nitrate supplementation in a relevant patient group.
