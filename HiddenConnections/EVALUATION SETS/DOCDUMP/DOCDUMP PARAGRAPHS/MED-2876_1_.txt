We investigated the role of dietary acid load, in terms of net endogenous acid production (NEAP), in chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. METHODS: 217 CKD patients on low-protein diet with a normal serum bicarbonate level were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study in Japan. The primary outcome was 25% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or start of dialysis.
