Abstract BACKGROUND: Water ingestion raises blood pressure substantially in patients with perturbed autonomic control and more modestly in older subjects. It is unclear whether prophylactic water drinking improves orthostatic tolerance in normal healthy adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-two healthy subjects, 18 to 42 years of age, with no history of syncope underwent head-up tilt-table testing at 60 degrees for 45 minutes or until presyncope or syncope occurred.
