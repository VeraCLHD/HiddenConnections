Abstract Increased oxidative stress contributes to the decline in cognitive performance during normal aging and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Dietary supplementation with fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidant potential have in some cases compensated for oxidative stress. Herein, we examined whether apple juice could alleviate the neurotoxic consequences of exposure of cultured neuronal cells to amyloid-beta (Abeta), since at least a portion of the neurotoxicity of Abeta is due to oxidative stress.
