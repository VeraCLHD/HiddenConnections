No significant changes were observed in most of renal parameters, however, there was a less decrease in eGFRcockcroft in 6-month change (p=0.044) and %change (p=0.031) with whole soy intake relative to milk placebo. Subgroup analysis among women with lowered renal function suggested whole soy consumption tended to improve markers of renal function relative to control. CONCLUSIONS: Six-month consumption of whole soy tended to have a modest improvement of renal function in prehypertensive postmenopausal women with lowered renal function.
