This study examined the effects of isolated soy protein consumption on urinary albumin excretion, serum lipids, plasma amino acids, and isoflavones in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Male patients (n = 14) with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy were followed in a crossover design for 7 mo. The study comprised two 8-wk intervention periods, placed between a 4-wk lead-in and two 4-wk washout periods.
