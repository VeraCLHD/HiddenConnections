The present study examined the cross-sectional associations between clinically-diagnosed depression and intakes of antioxidants, fruits and vegetables in a cohort of older adults. Antioxidant, fruit and vegetable intakes were assessed in 278 elderly participants (144 with depression, 134 without depression) using a Block 1998 food frequency questionnaire, which was administered between 1999 and 2007. All participants were age 60 years or over.
