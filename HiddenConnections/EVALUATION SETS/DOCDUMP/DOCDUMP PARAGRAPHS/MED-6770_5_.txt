The ILCRs for total exposure of the neighbors (inhalation+dermal contact+ingestion) were 2.6-31.3, 1.5-14.8, and 1.3-12.2 × 10(-6) in Chinese, Western, and BBQ restaurants, respectively. We suggest that the maximum acceptable exposure time to the exhaust stack outlet area for Chinese, Western, and BBQ restaurants ranges between 5-19, 17-42, and 18-56 h month(-1), respectively, based on an ILCR of less than 10(-6).
