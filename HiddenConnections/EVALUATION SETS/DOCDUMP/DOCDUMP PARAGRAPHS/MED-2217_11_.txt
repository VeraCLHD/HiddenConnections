After adjusting for cardiovascular disease risk factors, VD insufficiency was independently associated with SCF. The linear regression analysis showed that VD insufficiency was correlated independently with % flow-mediated dilatation (β=0.424, P<0.001) and carotid intima-media thickness (β=0.43, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: A strong association was found between VD insufficiency and the SCF phenomenon.
