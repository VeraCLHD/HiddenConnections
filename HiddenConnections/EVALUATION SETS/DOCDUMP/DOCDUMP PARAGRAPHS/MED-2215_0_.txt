Abstract Knowledge about sites and mechanisms of action of vitamin D and its analogs has been greatly advanced by histochemical approaches. High resolution and high sensitivity, combined with the integrative potential of relatively intact histochemical tissue preparations, contributed information that is difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise. In in vivo distribution studies with conventional biochemical assays, target cell populations associated with non-target tissues frequently remain unrecognized without the resolution achieved by cellular autoradiography.
