RESULTS: The incidence of mood disorder in the folic acid and placebo groups were 14.3% and 17.9% respectively, a non-significant difference. However, there was post-hoc evidence that folic acid delayed the time to onset of mood disorder in those participants who became unwell. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and rate of onset of mood disorders lower than expected.
