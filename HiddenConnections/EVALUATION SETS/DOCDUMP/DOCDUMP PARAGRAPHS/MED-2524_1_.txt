METHODS: MCF-7 cells were treated with benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) (10(-10)-10(-4) mol/l). After incubation for 24, 48, 72, and 92 h, the cells were harvested and extracted for 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The proteins involving proliferative and apoptotic pathways were evaluated by Western blot analysis.
