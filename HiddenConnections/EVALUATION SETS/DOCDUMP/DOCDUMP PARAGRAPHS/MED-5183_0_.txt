Abstract The specific role of dietary fat in breast cancer progression is unclear, although a low-fat diet was associated with decreased recurrence of estrogen receptor alpha negative (ER(-)) breast cancer. ER(-) basal-like MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cell lines contained a greater number of cytoplasmic lipid droplets compared to luminal ER(+) MCF-7 cells. Therefore, we studied lipid storage functions in these cells.
