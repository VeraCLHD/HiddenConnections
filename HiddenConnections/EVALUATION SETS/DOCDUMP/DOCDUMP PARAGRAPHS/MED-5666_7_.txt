Meat and diary products strongly contributed to breast-milk concentrations of dieldrin and PCBs, fish to PCB 118, and smoking to DDT and dieldrin. Our findings suggest that breast-milk contamination could be reduced by abstinence from smoking and a moderate intake of animal products. However, risk of nutritional deficiencies rules out complete avoidance of meat, fish or diary products.
