For fecal leakage, 78% of the men chose one of two extreme categories compared with 74% for urinary leakage, 71% for tender enlarged breasts, 73% for erectile dysfunction, and 78% for restricted diet. Thirty-seven percent of the men in the study were willing to accept fecal leakage if there was only the slightest chance to gain survival, comparing percentages for urinary leakage, tender enlarged breasts, restricted diet, and erectile dysfunction and were 48%, 53%, 55%, and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Willingness to accept therapy-induced long-term symptoms to avoid a shortened survival due to prostate cancer varies dramatically among men with localized prostate cancer and a large majority of men are in one of two extreme categories.
