Abstract BACKGROUND: The notion that the incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is low among the Inuit subsisting on a traditional marine diet has attained axiomatic status. The scientific evidence for this is weak and rests on early clinical evidence and uncertain mortality statistics. METHODS: We reviewed the literature and performed new analyses of the mortality statistics from Greenland, Canada, and Alaska.
