For T1DM, only a few studies have reported increased risks for meat consumers or for high intake of saturated fatty acids and nitrates and nitrites. For T2DM, CHD, and stroke, the evidence is strongest. Per 100 g of total meat, the pooled relative risk (RR) for T2DM is 1.15 (95 % CI 1.07-1.24), for (unprocessed) red meat 1.13 (95 % CI 1.03-1.23), and for poultry 1.04 (95 % CI 0.99-1.33); per 50 g of processed meat, the pooled RR is 1.32 (95 % CI 1.19-1.48).
