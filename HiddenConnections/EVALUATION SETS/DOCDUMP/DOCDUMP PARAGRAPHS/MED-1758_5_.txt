Age, sex, body mass index, season, medical history, and medication use were not associated with significant differences in preoperative plasma 25(OH)D concentrations. By day 2 there was a large increase in C-reactive protein concentrations (P < 0.001) and a significant decrease in 25(OH)D of â‰ˆ40% (P < 0.001). C-reactive protein, 25(OH)D, and calculated free 25(OH)D had not returned to preoperative concentrations by 5 d postoperatively (all P < 0.001).
