The dietary intake of NASH patients was richer in saturated fat (13.7% +/- 3.1% vs. 10.0% +/- 2.1% total kcal, respectively, P =.0001) and in cholesterol (506 +/- 108 vs. 405 +/- 111 mg/d, respectively, P =.002) and was poorer in polyunsaturated fat (10.0% +/- 3.5% vs. 14.5% +/- 4.0% total fat, respectively, P =.0001), fiber (12.9 +/- 4.1 vs. 23.2 +/- 7.8 g/d, respectively, P =.000), and antioxidant vitamins C (84.3 +/- 43.1 vs. 144.2 +/- 63.1 mg/d, respectively, P =.0001) and E (5.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 8.7 +/- 2.9 mg/d, respectively, P =.0001). The ISI was significantly lower in NASH patients than in controls. Postprandial total and very low density lipoproteins triglyceride at +4 hours and +6 hours, triglyceride area under the curve, and incremental triglyceride area under the curve were higher in NASH compared with controls.
