In this article, we summarize some of the studies that have advanced the understanding of the microbiome and its effects on metabolism, obesity, and health. Metagenomic studies demonstrated that certain mixes of gut microbiota may protect or predispose the host to obesity. Furthermore, microbiota transplantation studies in germ-free murine models showed that the efficient energy extraction traits of obese-type gut flora are transmissible.
