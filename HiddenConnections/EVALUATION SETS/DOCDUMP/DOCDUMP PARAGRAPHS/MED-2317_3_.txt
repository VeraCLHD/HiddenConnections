Feeding an HCD supplemented with a fluorescent cholesteryl ester to optically transparent fli1:EGFP zebrafish larvae in which endothelial cells (EC) express GFP, and using confocal microscopy enabled monitoring vascular lipid accumulation and the EC layer disorganization and thickening in a live animal. The HCD feeding also increased leakage of a fluorescent dextran from the blood vessels. Administering ezetimibe significantly diminished the HCD-induced EC layer thickening and improved its barrier function.
