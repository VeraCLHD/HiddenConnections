We analyzed serum samples (obtained in 74% of all boys) for gonadotropins, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone, and inhibin B. Results All phthalate monoesters were found in breast milk with large variations [medians (minimum–maximum)]: mMP 0.10 (< 0.01–5.53 μg/L), mEP 0.95 (0.07–41.4 μg/L), mBP 9.6 (0.6–10,900 μg/L), mBzP 1.2 (0.2–26 μg/L), mEHP 11 (1.5–1,410 μg/L), miNP 95 (27–469 μg/L). Finnish breast milk had higher concentrations of mBP, mBzP, mEHP, and Danish breast milk had higher values for miNP (p = 0.0001–0.056). No association was found between phthalate monoester levels and cryptorchidism.
