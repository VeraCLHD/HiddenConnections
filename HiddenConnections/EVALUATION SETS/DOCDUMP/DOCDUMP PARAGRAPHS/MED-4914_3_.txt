For further elucidation of the role of beta-carbolines in neurodegenerative disorders harman and norharman levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 14 patients with PD and compared to an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 14). CSF levels of norharman and harman in PD were significantly higher compared to controls. These results may suggest a possible role of harman and norharman or its N-methylated carbolinium ions in the pathophysiological processes initiating PD.
