Twenty men and women with the metabolic syndrome participated in a randomized, double blind, cross-over study of walnut consumption. Subjects had two four-day admissions to the clinical research center where they were fed an iso-caloric diet. In addition, they consumed shakes for breakfast containing either walnuts or placebo (shakes were standardized for calories, carbohydrate, and fat content).
