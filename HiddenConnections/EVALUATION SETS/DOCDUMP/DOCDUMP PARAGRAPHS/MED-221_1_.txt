The initial cause of insulin resistance is critical for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Lipotoxicity is a well-known concept in the explanation of initiation of insulin resistance. Although there are several prevailing hypotheses about the cellular/molecular mechanisms of lipotoxicity, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperinsulinemia, and ER stress, the relative importance of these hypothesized events remains to be determined.
