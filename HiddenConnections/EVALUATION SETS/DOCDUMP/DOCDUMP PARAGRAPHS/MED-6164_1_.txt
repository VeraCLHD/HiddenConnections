PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: From January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2005, we biennially screened a random sample of 1402 community-dwelling men with regular sexual partners and without known CAD for the presence of ED. Incidence densities of CAD were calculated after age stratification and adjusted for potential confounders by time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The prevalence of ED was 2% for men aged 40 to 49 years, 6% for men aged 50 to 59 years, 17% for men aged 60 to 69 years, and 39% for men aged 70 years or older.
