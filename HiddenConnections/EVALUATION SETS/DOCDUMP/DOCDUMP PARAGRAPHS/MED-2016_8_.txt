Studies where BMI was a primary outcome and studies of neutral quality were more likely to observe an association. CONCLUSIONS: Study results are conflicting and significant methodological issues limit the ability to draw conclusions from these studies. Prospective studies that measure BPA exposure and changes in body weight and composition are needed to establish temporality, causality and the direction of any observed associations.
