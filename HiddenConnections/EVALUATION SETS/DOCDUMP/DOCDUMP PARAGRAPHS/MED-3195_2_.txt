Thirty PCBs and 18 OCPs were measured in serum by gas chromatography. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the magnitude of association. Seven organochlorines, dieldrin, p,p'-DDE, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, heptachlor epoxide, and PCBs 153 and 180 were detected in at least 20% of all study participants.
