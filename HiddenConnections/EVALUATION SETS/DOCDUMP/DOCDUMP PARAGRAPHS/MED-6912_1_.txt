Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were the most frequently detected PFCs in these samples. Mean concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in foodstuffs were in the range of 0.05-1.99 ng/g fresh wt and 0.06-12.5 ng/g fresh wt, respectively. The mean concentrations of PFOA, perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), and PFOS in indoor dust were 205, 14.0, and 4.86 ng/g, dry wt, respectively.
