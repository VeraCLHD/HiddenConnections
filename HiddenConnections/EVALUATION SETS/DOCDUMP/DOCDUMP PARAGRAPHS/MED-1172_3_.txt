Prevalence of ESBL producing micro-organisms was 100% on conventional and 84% on organic samples (p<0.001). Median loads of ESBL producing micro-organisms were 80 (range <20-1360) in conventional, and <20 (range 0-260) CFU/25 g in organic samples (p=0.001). The distribution of ESBL genes in conventional samples and organic samples was 42% versus 56%, respectively (N.S.), for CTX-M-1, 20% versus 42% (N.S.) for TEM-52, and 23% versus 3% (p<0.001) for SHV-12.
