Abstract Women with a multiple pregnancy face greater risks for themselves and their infants than women pregnant with one child. Pre-pregnancy care should focus on avoiding multiple pregnancy. Early prenatal care centres on determining chorionicity and screening for fetal anomalies, with later care focusing on the presentation, prediction and management of preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction.
