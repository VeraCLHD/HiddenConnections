Two ophthalmologists, not aware of the MR results, independently assessed retinal arterial narrowing, crossings, sclerosis, and tortuosity according to standard scoring lists. Two observers independently assessed white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar infarcts on the MR images. Lesions were considered abnormal only when both ophthalmologists or MR raters agreed.
