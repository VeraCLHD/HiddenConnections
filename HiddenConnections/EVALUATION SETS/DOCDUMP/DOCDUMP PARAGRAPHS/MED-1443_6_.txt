Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to obtain the OR and corresponding 95 % CI. The average intake and consumption frequency of gim in cases were lower than in controls. The daily intake of gim was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer (5th v. 1st quintile, OR, 0.48; 95 % CI, 0.27, 0.86; P for trend, 0.026) after adjustment for potential confounders.
