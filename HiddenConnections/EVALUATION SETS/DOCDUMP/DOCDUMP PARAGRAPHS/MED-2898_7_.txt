Compared to 0 mg, all doses of nitrate resulted in higher plasma RXNO and nitrite, and salivary nitrite (P < 0.05). A linear dose-response to nitrate intake was observed with plasma RXNO and nitrite, and salivary nitrite (P < 0.001). Antibacterial toothpaste did not alter nitrate reduction in the mouth (P > 0.9) or blunt the increase in nitric oxide status (P > 0.9).
