Circulating low-density lipoprotein binds with glycosaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane and increases its permeability. Filtered lipoprotein accumulates in mesangial cells and stimulates them to proliferate and produce excess basement membrane material. The proximal tubular cells metabolise some of the filtered lipoprotein and the remainder are altered on passage down the nephron.
