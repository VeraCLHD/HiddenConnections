Subjects were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of watermelon extract supplementation (L-citrulline/L-arginine, 6 g daily) or placebo followed by a 2-week washout period and then crossover. RESULTS: Ankle and brachial SBP (-11.5 ± 3.8 and -15.1 ± 2.8 mm Hg), DBP (-7.8 ± 2.3 and -7.6 ± 1.8 mm Hg), and MAP (-9.8 ± 2.6 and -7.3 ± 1.8 mm Hg), and cAIx (-8.8 ± 2.6 %) decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after watermelon supplementation compared to placebo. Watermelon supplementation had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on ABI and HR.
