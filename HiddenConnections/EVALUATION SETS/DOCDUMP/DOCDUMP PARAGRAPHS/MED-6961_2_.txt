Much evidence arising from laboratory and clinical studies suggests that growth factors and their receptors are implicated in cancer metastases development. We review the origin and production of growth factors and their receptors in all stages of cancer metastases including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer cell invasion and migration, survival within the circulation, seeding at distant organs and metastatic tumour angiogenesis. The functions of growth factors and their receptors are also discussed.
