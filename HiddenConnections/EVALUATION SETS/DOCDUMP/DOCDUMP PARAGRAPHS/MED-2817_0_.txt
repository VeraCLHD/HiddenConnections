Abstract Though human pain has existed since the dawn of time, formal medical pain relief in the form of anesthesia and analgesia has been available only since the mid-nineteenth century. Even after these measures became available, they were used very selectively for the first 100 years of their existence. The youngest patients, especially, were denied pain relief, probably because they could not complain about their pain as articulately and as effectively as adult patients could.
