CONCLUSION: While well aware of the biases inherent in this type of study, we estimated the cumulative and point prevalences of food allergies in a population of school-age children in Toulouse at 6.7% and 4.7%, respectively. Cow milk, eggs, and peanuts were the main foods reported as causing allergies. Exotic fruits, shellfish, and tree nuts appeared to be relatively new allergens.
