Epithelial apoptosis was analysed in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‐mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick‐end labelling and 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole staining. Results Patients with active Crohn's disease showed an impaired intestinal barrier function as indicated by a distinct reduction in epithelial resistance. As distribution of conductivity was even, focal epithelial lesions (eg, microerosions) did not contribute to barrier dysfunction.
