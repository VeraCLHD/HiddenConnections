Results Figitumumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated at doses up to 20Â mg/kg; no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at this dose level. When given in combination, figitumumab plasma exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. The approximate 2-fold accumulation following repeated administration supported the 21-day regimen as appropriate for figitumumab administration.
