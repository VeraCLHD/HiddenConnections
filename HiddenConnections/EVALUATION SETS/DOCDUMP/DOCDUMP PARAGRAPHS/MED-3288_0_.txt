Abstract Senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were found in 38 (74.5%) of 51 unselected brains of nondemented patients who died between the ages of 55 and 64 years. A high proportion (22, or 43%) had only NFTs. These were consistently present in the entorhinal cortex and/or the hippocampus; the olfactory bulb, the amygdala, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert were also occasionally involved.
