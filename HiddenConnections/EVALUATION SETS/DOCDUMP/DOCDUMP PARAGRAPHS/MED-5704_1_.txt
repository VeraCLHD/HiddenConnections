To elucidate the relationship between nutrition and ROS generation, we have investigated the effect of glucose challenge on ROS generation by leucocytes, p47phox protein, a key protein in the enzyme NADPH oxidase and alpha-tocopherol levels. Blood samples were drawn from 14 normal subjects prior to, at 1, 2 and 3 h following ingestion of 75 g glucose. ROS generation by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) and mononuclear cells (MNC) increased to a peak of 244 +/- 42% and 233 +/- 34% of the basal respectively at 2h.
