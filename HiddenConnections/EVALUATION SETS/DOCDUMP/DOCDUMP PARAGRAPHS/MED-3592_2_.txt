Methods We performed a cross sectional study, analyzing data from 539 individuals with diverticulosis and 1569 without (controls). Participants underwent colonoscopy and assessment of diet, physical activity and bowel habits. Our analysis was limited our analysis to participants with no knowledge of their diverticular disease, to reduce the risk of biased responses.
