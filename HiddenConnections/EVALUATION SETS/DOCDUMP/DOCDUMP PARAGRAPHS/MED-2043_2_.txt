Equol is superior to all other isoflavones in its antioxidant activity. It is the end product of the biotransformation of the phytoestrogen daidzein, one of the two main isoflavones found in abundance in soybeans and most soy foods. Once formed, it is relatively stable; however, equol is not produced in all healthy adults in response to dietary challenge with soy or daidzein.
