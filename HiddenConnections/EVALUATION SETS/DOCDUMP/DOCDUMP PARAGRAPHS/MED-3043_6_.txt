Both [IgA(s)] and [IgA(s)]:[Alb(s)] were significantly related to the number of days showing symptoms of influenza ( P<0.01) and the total number of days of sickness ( P<0.05). These data provide quantitative support for the belief that regular, moderate exercise results in an increased [IgA(s)] at rest and [IgA(s)]:[Alb(s)], which may contribute to a decreased risk of infection.
