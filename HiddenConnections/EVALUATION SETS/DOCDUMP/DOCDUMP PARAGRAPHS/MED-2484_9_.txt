The concentrations of intracellular triglycerides and total cholesterols were reduced in the presence of balsamic vinegar. In addition, balsamic vinegar decreased the mRNA and protein expression level of scavenger receptors in THP-1 macrophages. These results showed that balsamic vinegar contained abundant polyphenols and inhibited LDL oxidation and oxidized LDL-induced foam cell formation by decreasing the expression of scavenger receptors.
