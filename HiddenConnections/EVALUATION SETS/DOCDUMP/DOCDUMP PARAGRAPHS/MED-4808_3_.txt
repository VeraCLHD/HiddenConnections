METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one patients with AFs were randomized to receive a "true-elimination diet" or a "sham-elimination diet" for 8 weeks; both groups also received topical nifedipine and lidocaine. Sixty patients who were cured with the "true-elimination diet" underwent DBPC challenge in which cow's milk and wheat were used. RESULTS: At the end of the study, 69% of the "true-diet group" and 45% of the "sham-diet group" showed complete healing of AFs (P<0.0002).
