CONCLUSION: Inferences from studies that have reported associations between grain fiber intake and morbidity or mortality may be limited by not differentiating fiber sources. Future studies should distinguish fiber from whole vs. refined grains. Public health policy should differentiate whole grains from refined, and recommend increased consumption of the former.
