Data from 10 trials representing 268 participants were examined using a random-effects model. Pooled mean net change in total cholesterol for those treated with a legume diet compared to control was −11.8 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], −16.1 to −7.5); mean net change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol was −8.0 mg/dL (95% CI, −11.4 to −4.6). Conclusion These results indicate that a diet rich in legumes other than soy decreases total and LDL cholesterol.
