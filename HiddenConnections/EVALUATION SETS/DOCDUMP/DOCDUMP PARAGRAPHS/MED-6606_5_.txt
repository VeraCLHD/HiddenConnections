Compared to the control arm, 6 CAFs—including pro-angiogenic factors (stromal-cell derived-1α and myeloid factors (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor — all decreased in the LF arm compared to controls; 3 and 4 CAFs changed in the FS and FS+LF arms, respectively. Weight loss occurred in the LF arms and significantly correlated with VEGF decreases (P <0.001). The CAFs that changed in the LF arm are all known to be regulated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and a pathway analysis identified NF-κB as the most likely regulatory network associated with these changes in the LF arm, but not in the FS-containing arms.
