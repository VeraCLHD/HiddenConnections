In COS-1 cells transiently transfected with an oestrogen-responsive reporter gene, PhIP (10(-10)-10(-6) M) mediated transcription through oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha, but not ER-beta, and inhibition by the pure ER antagonist ICI 182 780 demonstrated a requirement for a functional ER. In contrast, the structurally related food-derived carcinogen 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) failed to induce reporter gene transcription. Additionally, we show that in a hormonally responsive breast cancer cell line (MCF-7 cells), PhIP induced transcriptional activation using endogenously expressed ER.
