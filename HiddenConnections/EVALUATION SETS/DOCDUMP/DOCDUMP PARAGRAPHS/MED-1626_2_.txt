Research conducted to date suggests that arsenical drugs, specifically roxarsone, used in poultry production result in the accumulation of arsenic in the keratinous material of poultry feathers.

Consequently, the presence and nature of arsenic in twelve samples of feather meal product from six US states and China were examined.
