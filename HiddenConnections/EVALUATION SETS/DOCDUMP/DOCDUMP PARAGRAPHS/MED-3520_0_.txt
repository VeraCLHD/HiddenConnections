Abstract Developing countries face a dual challenge of both communicable and non-communicable disease - 80% of deaths from cardiovascular disease occur in low and middle-income countries. Hypertension ranks highest as an attributable cause of mortality in both developed and developing countries. The prevalence of hypertension is rising rapidly in Nigeria, from 11% two decades ago to about 30% in recent times.
