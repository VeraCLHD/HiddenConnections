Eleven subjects participated in a randomized crossover study in which they consumed either high-RS (39 +/- 3 g/d, -chi +/- SEM) or low-RS (5 +/- 0.4 g/d) diets for 3 wk. All other macronutrients were kept constant. During the high-RS diet daily excretion of fecal nitrogen increased from 1.84 +/- 0.15 to 2.86 +/- 0.42 g/d (P < 0.01) and excretion of fecal phenols fell from 9.2 +/- 1.4 to 5.3 +/- 0.8 mg/d (P < 0.01).
