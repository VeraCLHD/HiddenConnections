Associations with total mortality were consistent according to age, gender, BB use, diabetes and hypertension status (all p values for interaction >0.10). Conversely, RHR was not predictive of incident CHD (n = 228 events; top vs lowest quintile: HR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.6-1.5). CONCLUSIONS: RHR is an independent risk marker of mortality but not of incident CHD events in community-dwelling elderly.
