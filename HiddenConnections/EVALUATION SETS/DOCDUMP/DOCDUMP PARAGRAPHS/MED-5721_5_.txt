After a 10-day run-in period, subjects consumed either an active strawberry beverage (Str; containing 10 g freeze-dried fruit) or a placebo (Pbo) beverage matched in energy and macronutrient composition for 6 weeks. Twice before randomization and once at the 6-week crossover point, subjects received either Str or Pbo with a high-fat challenge meal (HFM). TC, LDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, and OxLDL were measured at defined intervals for 6 h before and after HFM challenge.
