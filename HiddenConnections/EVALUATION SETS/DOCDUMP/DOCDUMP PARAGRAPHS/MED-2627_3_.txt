In this regard, the beneficial effects of training on endothelial function can be mediated in a number of ways, including synthesis of molecular mediators, changes in neurohormonal release and oxidant/antioxidant balance. On the other hand, physical exercise can also elicit systemic molecular pathways connected with angiogenesis and chronic anti-inflammatory action with consequent modification of the endothelial function. However, its benefit depends on the type and intensity of training performed.
