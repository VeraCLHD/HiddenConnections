Incompatibility/replicon typing demonstrated that 41 were IncI1 plasmids, 40 of which only conferred blaCMY associated resistance. Six were IncA/C plasmids that carried additional resistance genes. Plasmid multi-locus sequence typing (pMLST) of the IncI1-blaCMY plasmids showed that 27 (65.8%) were sequence type (ST) 12, the most common ST among blaCMY-IncI1 plasmids from Heidelberg isolated from humans.
