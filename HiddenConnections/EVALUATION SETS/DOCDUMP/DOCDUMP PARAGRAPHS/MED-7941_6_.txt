Ten control and 10 infected birds fed each diet were sampled on d 6 and d 10 postinfection. The induced infection produced significant depressions in growth and feed intake and detrimental morphological changes in the small intestine of poults in the absence of mortality. Weight gains, protein content of jejunum, and morphometric indices of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were greater in challenged poults fed 0.3 g/100 g putrescine than in controls.
