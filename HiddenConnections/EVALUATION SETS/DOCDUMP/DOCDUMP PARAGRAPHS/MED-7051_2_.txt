In this study, we determined the amounts of the biogenic monoamines CS, FS, CT, and FT in commonly consumed vegetables using high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonin, tryptamine, and tyramine were detected in all vegetables tested. The serotonin levels ranged from 1.8 to 294 microg/g of dry weight, the tryptamine levels ranged from 0.8 to 372 microg/g of dry weight, and the tyramine levels ranged from 1.4 to 286 microg/g of dry weight.
