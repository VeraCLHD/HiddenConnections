These samples, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells when available, were incubated alone (control), or with either (a) LPS (1-2,000 ng/ml), (b) TiO(2)(5 microg/ml) or (c) LPS (1 ng/ml) adsorbed to TiO(2)(5 microg/ml). In each case, the levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) produced in these assays were quantitated by bioassay and by ELISA. Interestingly, there was dramatic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells using the TiO(2)-LPS conjugate, with values 30-60-fold above controls and only minor stimulation with LPS or TiO(2)alone.
