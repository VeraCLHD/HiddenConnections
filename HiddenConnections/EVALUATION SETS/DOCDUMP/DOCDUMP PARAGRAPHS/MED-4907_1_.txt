To explore the relationship and dose response, we assessed the impacts of coffee and alcohol intake on serum GGT activity in apparently healthy men and women with varying levels of coffee and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Data on coffee, alcohol consumption and serum GGT activities were collected from 18,899 individuals (8807 men and 10,092 women), mean age 48 years, range 25-74 years, who participated in a large national cross-sectional health survey. Body mass index, smoking index and age were used as covariates in all analyses.
