The mechanism for elevated blood pressure seen with habitually increased salt intake is unclear, especially the effect of salt in a single meal on plasma sodium concentration and blood pressure. To resolve this we compared the effect of soup with or without 6 g of salt (an amount similar to that in a single meal) on the plasma sodium concentration and blood pressure in 10 normotensive volunteers using a randomized, crossover design. The plasma sodium concentration was significantly increased by 3.13±0.75 mmol/l with salted compared with unsalted soup.
