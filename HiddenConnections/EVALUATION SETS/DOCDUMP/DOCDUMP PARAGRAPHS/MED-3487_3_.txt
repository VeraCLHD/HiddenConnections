Flow-mediated vasoactivity rose from 5.0 +/- 3.6% at baseline to 10.5 +/- 5.6%, 13.3 +/- 4.3%, and 15.7 +/- 4.9% (all p < 0.05) as cholesterol fell from 200 +/- 12 to 161 +/- 18, 169 +/- 16, and 153 +/- 11 mg/dl after 2, 4, and 12 weeks, respectively, of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Vasoactivity and cholesterol returned to baseline levels 12 weeks after simvastatin discontinuation. Overall, vasoactivity was found to correlate inversely with cholesterol levels (r = -0.47, p = 0.004).
