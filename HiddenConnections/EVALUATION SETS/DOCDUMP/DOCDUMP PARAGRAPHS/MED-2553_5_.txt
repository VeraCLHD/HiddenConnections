These results were confirmed in plasma samples from 84 patients undergoing gastro-oesophageal endoscopy. Differences between 25 smokers and 59 non-smokers are again much lower for myosmine (0.30 +/- 0.35 vs 0.16 +/- 0.18 ng ml(-1), p <0.05) than for cotinine (54.67 +/- 29.63 vs 0.61 +/- 1.82 ng ml(-1), p <0.0001). In conclusion, sources other than tobacco contribute considerably to the human body burden of myosmine.
