This was followed by a 5-wk washout period. Plasma lipid, folate, homocyst(e)ine, and vitamin C (a compliance marker) concentrations were measured at baseline, after each treatment, and after the washout period. RESULTS: Consumption of 750 mL but not of 250 or 500 mL orange juice daily increased HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 21% (P: < 0.001), triacylglycerol concentrations by 30% (from 1.56 +/- 0.72 to 2.03 +/- 0.91 mmol/L; P: < 0.02), and folate concentrations by 18% (P: < 0.01); decreased the LDL-HDL cholesterol ratio by 16% (P: < 0.005); and did not affect homocyst(e)ine concentrations.
