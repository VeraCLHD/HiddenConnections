Dietary PLs have a positive impact on several human diseases and reduce the side-effects of some drugs. As rice has long been consumed as a staple food in many Asian countries, rice PLs may have significant health benefits for those populations. Rice PLs may be influenced both by genetic (G) and environmental (E) factors, and resolving GÃ—E interactions may allow future exploitation of PL composition and content, thus boosting rice eating quality and health benefits for consumers.
