After 72 h, DNA migration decreased to about control level. The distribution of DNA migration among cells clearly demonstrated that the majority of white blood cells exhibited increased DNA migration and that the effect was not only due to a small fraction of damaged cells. From the same blood samples, blood cultures were set up to study a possible effect on the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), another indicator for genotoxic effects.
