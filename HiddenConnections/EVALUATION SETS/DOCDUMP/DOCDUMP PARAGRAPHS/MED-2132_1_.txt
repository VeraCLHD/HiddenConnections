During the follow-up (6 years for the HPFS and 24 years for the NHS), the authors identified 156 incident male Parkinson’s disease cases (HPFS) and 402 female cases (NHS). In the HPFS, compared with men with daily bowel movements, men with a bowel movement every 3 days or less had a multivariate-adjusted relative risk of 4.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.59, 9.57) for developing Parkinson’s disease in the next 6 years. In the NHS, the corresponding relative risk was 2.15 (95% CI: 0.76, 6.10), and the risk of Parkinson’s disease was not elevated beyond 6 years of follow-up (relative risks = 1.25 for years 7–12, 0.54 for years 13–18, and 0.88 for years 19–24).
