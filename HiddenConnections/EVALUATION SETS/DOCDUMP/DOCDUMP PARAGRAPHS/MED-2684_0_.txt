Abstract OBJECTIVES: The anti-cariogenic properties of the phenolic fraction from the pomace of Vitis coignetiae (VcPP) were evaluated by in vitro assays and compared with fruit juices from V. coignetiae and common grapes and with other phenolic fractions. The effects of VcPP against the biofilm of Streptococcus mutans were investigated. DESIGN: Sucrose-dependent biofilm formation by S. mutans cultured in the presence of VcPP was measured by crystal violet dye uptake.
