The N-OH-PhIP can be esterified by phase II enzymes forming an arylnitrenium ion that binds to DNA causing adducts. Furthermore, N-OH-PhIP may be reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase producing superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals causing DNA strand breaks. Diallyl sulfide (DAS) has been shown to prevent cancer in several animal models, presumably by metabolic modulation.
