Abstract AIM OF THE STUDY: Drinking camel urine has been used traditionally to treat numerous cases of cancer yet, the exact mechanism was not investigated. Therefore, we examined the ability of three different camel urines (virgin, lactating, and pregnant source) to modulate a well-known cancer-activating enzyme, the cytochrome P450 1a1 (Cyp1a1) in murine hepatoma Hepa 1c1c7 cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of different camel urines, compared to bovine urines, on Cyp1a1 mRNA was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
