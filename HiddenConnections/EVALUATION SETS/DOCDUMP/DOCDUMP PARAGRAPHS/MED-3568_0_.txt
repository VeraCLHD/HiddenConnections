Abstract Intake of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. We sought to estimate the association between intake of fish and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and suicide mortality over the course of long-term follow-up. In this prospective cohort study, biennial questionnaires were administered to 42,290 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1988–2008), 72,231 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (1986–2008), and 90,836 women enrolled in Nurses' Health Study II (1993–2007).
