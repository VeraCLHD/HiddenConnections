When examined in the same model, continuous measures of physical activity (HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.42–0.68, P < .001) and carotenoids (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59–0.98, P = .04) predicted survival during follow-up. CONCLUSION The combination of low total serum carotenoids and low physical activity, both modifiable risk factors, strongly predicted earlier mortality. These findings provide preliminary support that higher fruit and vegetable intake and exercise improve survival.
