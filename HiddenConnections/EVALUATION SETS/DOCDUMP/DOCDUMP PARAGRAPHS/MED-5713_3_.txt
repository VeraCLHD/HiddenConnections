OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test the ability of strawberry phenolic compounds to mitigate the postprandial effects of a high-fat meal on OxLDL as well as investigate the effects of phenolic compounds on lipid metabolism. METHODS: Twenty-four hyperlipidemic men and women (14 women, 10 men; mean age 50.9 +/- SD 15 years) were recruited to participate in this randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-wk crossover trial. After a 10-day run-in period, subjects consumed either an active strawberry beverage (Str; containing 10 g freeze-dried fruit) or a placebo (Pbo) beverage matched in energy and macronutrient composition for 6 weeks.
