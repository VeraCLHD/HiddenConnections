SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 2011), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 2011), PubMed (from 1946 to 20 October 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to 20 October 2011) and CINAHL (from 1981 to 20 October 2011). In addition, we searched several conference proceedings (from 2000 to either 2010 or 2011) and reference lists of relevant articles. To identify ongoing trials we contacted researchers working on this topic and we scanned the National Institute of Health Register and the ISRCTN Register (www.controlled-trials.com; searched May 2012).
