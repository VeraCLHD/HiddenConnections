A multidisciplinary approach, characterizing the food and phytochemical intake as well as the metabolic potency of the gut microbiota, while measuring biomarkers of both exposure and response in target tissues, is therefore of critical importance. With polyphenol metabolism as example, this review describes how the incorporation of microbial metabolism as an important variable in the evaluation of the final bioactivity of botanicals strongly increases the relevance and predictive value of the outcome. Moreover, knowledge about intestinal processes may offer innovative strategies for targeted product development.
