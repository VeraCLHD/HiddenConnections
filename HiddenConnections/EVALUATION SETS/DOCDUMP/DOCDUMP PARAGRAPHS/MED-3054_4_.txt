Substantial amounts of genistin (up to 90 nmol/g FW) were found in leaves, while the levels were marginally detectable (less than 0.5 nmol/g FW) in fruit peels. In either case, no drastic variations in endogenous phenolic contents were observed. Fruit peels were found to accumulate high levels of naringenin chalcone, implicating the limitation of naringenin substrates for isoflavone synthesis.
