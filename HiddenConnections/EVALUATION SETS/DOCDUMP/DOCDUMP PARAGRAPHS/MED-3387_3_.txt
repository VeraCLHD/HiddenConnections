Volunteers were tested on 2 nonconsecutive days after an overnight fast in randomized order. On 1 day, the volunteers consumed large (>2000 μm) rice particles, and on the second day, small rice particles (500-1000 μm). Subsequently, gastric emptying using the sodium [(13)C] acetate breath test (for 240 minutes) and GR and IR (for 120 minutes) from finger-prick blood samples were measured.
