Abstract PURPOSE: We investigated whether the plasma level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) after a diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) influences survival outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 1,598 patients with stage I to III CRC. We sought association between plasma 25-OHD and stage-specific survival and tested for interaction between 25-OHD level and variation at the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene locus.
