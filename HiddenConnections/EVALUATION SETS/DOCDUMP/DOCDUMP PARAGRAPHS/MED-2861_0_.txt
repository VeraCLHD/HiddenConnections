Abstract BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological, animal and human data report that lycopene has a protective effect against ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced erythema. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether tomato paste--rich in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant--can protect human skin against UVR-induced effects partially mediated by oxidative stress, i.e. erythema, matrix changes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. METHODS: In a randomized controlled study, 20 healthy women (median age 33 years, range 21-47; phototype I/II) ingested 55 g tomato paste (16 mg lycopene) in olive oil, or olive oil alone, daily for 12 weeks.
