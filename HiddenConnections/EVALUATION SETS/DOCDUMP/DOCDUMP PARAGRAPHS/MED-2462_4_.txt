Results showed no significant quantitative changes in postprandial apolipoprotein (apo) B48 levels following the consumption of DRW or RW compared to water. However, qualitatively, DRW may reduce arterial exposure to apoB48-containing lipoproteins over the 6-h postprandial period measured. DRW consumption did not significantly change postprandial TG or insulin levels.
