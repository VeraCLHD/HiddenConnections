We calculated the differences in blood pressure change between the calcium supplementation and control groups and pooled the estimates with each trial weighted with the inverse of the variance using a random effects model. The predictors of blood pressure reduction that we examined included method of supplementation, baseline blood pressure, and the methodologic quality of the studies. The pooled analysis shows a reduction in systolic blood pressure of -1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -2.20 to -0.68; P < .001) and in diastolic blood pressure of -0.84 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -1.44 to -0.24; P < .001).
