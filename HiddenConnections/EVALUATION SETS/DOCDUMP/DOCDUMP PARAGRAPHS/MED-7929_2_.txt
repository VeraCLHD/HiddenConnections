DESIGN: The study was a non blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial in which 22 volunteers (60% overweight and 40% obese) with increased CHD-risk were randomly assigned to receive WM or control meat (CM) during two different periods of 5 weeks. RESULTS: A significant interaction time*treatment (p < 0.05) was observed in all enzymes and substrates tested except HDL-C, uric acid and LPO. The treatment significantly increased CAT activity, total glutathione and GSSG (p < 0.05).
