Abstract The challenge of preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in US Hispanics depends upon being able to understand and communicate about the diversity within this population in terms of environmental exposures, health behaviors, socio-cultural experiences and genetic background to CVD risk factor profiles and disease burdens. Recent publications from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) launched by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have begun to accomplish this task. In this article we review some of the HCHS/SOL findings concerning cardiometabolic and other CVD risk factors and relate them to the need for increased access to health care and attention to lifestyle variables including nutrition.
