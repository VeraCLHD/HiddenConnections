In both normal subjects and diabetic patients, urinary AER did not increase after each kind of protein loading. Plasma concentrations of alanine, glycine, and arginine, known to induce glomerular hyperfiltration, increased to a greater degree after ingestion of tuna fish meal than after administration of bean curd. These findings suggest that responses of GFR to acute protein loading may differ according to the amino acid composition of the protein ingested and to the stage of diabetic nephropathy.
