Findings IGF1 concentrations, adjusted for age, were positively associated with height and age at first pregnancy, inversely associated with age at menarche and years since menopause, and were higher in moderately overweight women and moderate alcohol consumers than in other women. The OR for breast cancer for women in the highest versus the lowest fifth of IGF1 concentration was 1·28 (95% CI 1·14–1·44; p<0·0001). This association was not altered by adjusting for IGFBP3, and did not vary significantly by menopausal status at blood collection.
