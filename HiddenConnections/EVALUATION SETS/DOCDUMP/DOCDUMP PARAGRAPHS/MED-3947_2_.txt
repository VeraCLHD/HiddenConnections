Nutritional supplements are a feasible intervention for primary prevention and several epidemiological studies have indicated links between low folate status and depressive symptomatology in the general population. METHOD: A randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial in which participants, aged 14-24 years, at increased familial risk of mood disorder, were randomised to folic acid (2.5 mg daily) or identical placebo liquid for a maximum of 36 months. Primary outcome data (the onset of a DSM-IV mood disorder) were collected from 112 participants; 56 per group.
