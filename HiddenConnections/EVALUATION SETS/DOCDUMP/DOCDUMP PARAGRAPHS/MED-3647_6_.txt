No identifiable cause for defecation syncope was found in 11 patients, but new medical problems were noted in four of those patients. In follow-up at two years, syncope had recurred in ten patients, but the majority of recurrences were unassociated with defecation. Seven patients died during the follow-up period of underlying chronic diseases.
