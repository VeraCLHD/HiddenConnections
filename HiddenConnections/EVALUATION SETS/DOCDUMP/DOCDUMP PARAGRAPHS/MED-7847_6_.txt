The patients' quality of life was significantly improved in the TE group after 8 weeks of treatment (P < 0.05), but not in placebo group. A significant improvement in total symptom scores, combining sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, was observed after oral administration of TE for 8 weeks (P < 0.01). The safety of TE treatment was confirmed by laboratory tests and inspection of general conditions.
