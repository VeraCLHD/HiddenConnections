Animal protein intake was also positively associated with AA secretion (P < 0.05), which explained 1% of its variation. FFM (P = 0.1) and total protein intake (P = 0.05) showed positive trends. The difference in daily AA secretion between the lowest and highest quartile of FM was comparable to that between the lowest and highest estimated activity of one of the major steroidogenic enzymes.
