The mean glomerular filtration rate, as judged by 51Cr-EDTA, was similar after 6 months on each diet and remained unchanged throughout the entire year of the study. The rate of fall of glomerular filtration, as measured by the slope of 1/serum creatinine was slowed by 73% during the 1-year study period as compared with the prestudy period. Nutritional status (as measured by body mass index, midarm circumference, and lean body mass and percent body fat), serum transferrin, cholesterol and albumin, and total lymphocyte count were similar on the two diets.
