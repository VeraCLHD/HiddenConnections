Fish consumption, categorized as <2 vs. ≥2 portions/week, was measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Insulin sensitivity (SI) and acute insulin response (AIR) were determined from frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Higher fish consumption was independently associated with lower SI-adjusted AIR (β=−0.13 [−0.25, −0.016], p=0.03, comparing ≥ 2 vs. <2 portions/week).
