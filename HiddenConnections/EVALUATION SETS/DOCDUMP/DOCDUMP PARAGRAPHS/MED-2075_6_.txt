MATERIALS AND METHODS: Zeranol, leptin and (-)-gossypol were used to investigate MCF-7 Adr cell growth. RESULTS: Leptin enhanced the sensitivity of MCF-7 Adr cells to zeranol and increased cell growth. Exposure to zeranol may lead to initiation of transformation of normal breast cells to breast preneoplastic cells.
