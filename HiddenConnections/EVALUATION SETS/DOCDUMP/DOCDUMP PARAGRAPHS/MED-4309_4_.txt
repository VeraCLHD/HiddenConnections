Breast cancers (n=899) were tracked through the Western Washington Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Results Breast cancer risk was reduced by 60% in women who met at least five recommendations compared to those who met none (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.25–0.65; Ptrend<0.001). Further analyses that sequentially removed individual recommendations least associated with reduced risk suggested that this reduction is due to meeting recommendations related to body fatness, plant foods and alcohol (HR for meeting vs. not meeting these three recommendations: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.25–0.58; Ptrend <0.001).
