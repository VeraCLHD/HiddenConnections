No relationship was found between self-experienced adverse reactions to CM or gluten and mucosal reactivity to these proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived FI is reported frequently by RA patients, with a prevalence similar to that reported previously in the general population. Mucosal reactivity to CM and gluten is seen in a minor fraction of RA patients and is not related to the frequently perceived intolerance to these proteins.
