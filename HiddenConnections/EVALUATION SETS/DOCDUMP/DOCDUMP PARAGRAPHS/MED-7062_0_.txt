Abstract Bioavailability of micronutrients iron and zinc is particularly low from plant foods. Hence there is a need to evolve a food-based strategy to improve the same to combat widespread deficiencies of these minerals in a population dependent on plant foods. Dietary sulfur-containing amino acids have been reported to improve the mineral status of experimental animals.
