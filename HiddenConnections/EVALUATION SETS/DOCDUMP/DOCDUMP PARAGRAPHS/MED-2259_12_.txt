An altered curvature of the penis was reported by 30 patients (10%). Patients had increasing risk of UI during sexual activity (odds ratio [OR] 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.25) and orgasmic dysfunction (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.16) with increasing International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire scores. Erectile dysfunction (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.07-3.10) and a high body mass index (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19) increased the risk of PS after RP.
