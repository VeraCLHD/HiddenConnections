Abstract The study evaluated the protective effects of purple rice (Oryza sativa L.) bran extract (PRE) and its constituents, cyanidin and peonidin, against angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The effects of VEGF and PRE were examined by in vitro tube formation assays and following 14-day co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts. The antiangiogenic mechanism of PRE was evaluated by VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of HUVECs and/or human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38.
