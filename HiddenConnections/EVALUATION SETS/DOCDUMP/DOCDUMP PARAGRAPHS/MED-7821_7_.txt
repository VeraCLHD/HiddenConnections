Total plasma antioxidant capacity and plasma levels of total lipid hydroperoxides and those linked to LDL were evaluated by chemiluminescence. The results were expressed as median values and their 25th to 75th percentiles, with a 5% level of significance. RESULTS: No significant difference occurred in LDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels across groups.
