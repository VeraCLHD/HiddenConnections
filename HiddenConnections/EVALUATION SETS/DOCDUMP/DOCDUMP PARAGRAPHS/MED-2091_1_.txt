Recent observations suggest that a small increase in plasma sodium concentration may contribute to the pressor response of dietary salt. Because endothelial cells are (i) sensitive to aldosterone, (ii) in physical contact with plasma sodium, and (iii) crucial regulators of vascular tone, we tested whether acute changes in plasma sodium concentration, within the physiological range, can alter the physical properties of endothelial cells. The tip of an atomic force microscope was used as a nanosensor to measure stiffness of living endothelial cells incubated for 3 days in a culture medium containing aldosterone at a physiological concentration (0.45 nM).
