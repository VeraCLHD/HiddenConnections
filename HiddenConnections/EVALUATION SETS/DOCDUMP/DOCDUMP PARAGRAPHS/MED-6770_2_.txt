The total benzo[a]pyrene potency equivalent (B[a]P(eq)) concentrations, however, were highest in Chinese restaurants (1.82 ± 2.24 μg m(-3)), followed by Western (0.86 ± 1.43 μg m(-3), p<0.01) and BBQ-type restaurants (0.59 ± 0.55 μg m(-3), p<0.01). We further developed a probabilistic risk model to assess the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people exposed to carcinogenic PAHs. Because the exhaust stack directly affected the back-door neighbors of these restaurants, we were concerned with the real exposure of groups near the exhaust stack outlets of these restaurants.
