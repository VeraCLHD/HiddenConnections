Blood was drawn after each bout of exercise for the determination of ex vivo free radicals, DNA damage, protein carbonyls, lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) concentration, and a range of lipid-soluble antioxidants. Lipid-derived oxygen-centered free radicals (hyperfine coupling constants a(Nitrogen) = 13.7 Gauss (G) and aÎ²(Hydrogen) = 1.8 G) increased as a result of acute moderate and high-intensity exercise (P < 0.05), while DNA damage was also increased (P < 0.05). Systemic changes were observed in LOOH and for lipid-soluble antioxidants throughout exercise (P < 0.05); however, there was no observed change in protein carbonyl concentration (P > 0.05).
