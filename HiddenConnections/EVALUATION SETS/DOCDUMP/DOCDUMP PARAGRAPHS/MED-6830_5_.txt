Hazard ratios (HRs) for hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level >7 mg/dl) were estimated with Cox regression model after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, hypertension, heavy cigarette smoking, and frequent alcohol consumption. In all patients, HRs were 1.16 (P < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, 1.39 (P < 0.001) for total CVD, and 1.35 (P = 0.02) for ischemic stroke. In subgroup analysis, the HRs for cardiovascular risk remained significant in patients with hypertension (1.44, P < 0.001) and in patients with diabetes (1.64, P < 0.001).
