Many Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are transported globally from the areas in which they are produced and released into the environment in remote areas, including Antarctica. Here we report results obtained concerning the accumulation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), mono- and non-ortho-polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the tissues of two species of Antarctic fish (Chionodraco hamatus and Trematomus bernacchii). The 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs) were also calculated to evaluate the potential risk of these compounds for the two species.
