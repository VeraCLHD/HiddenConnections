However, the intense nature of specific protocols, particularly the "all-out" efforts characteristic of sprint interval training (SIT), may be perceived as being aversive. The purpose of this study was to determine whether listening to self-selected music can reduce the potential aversiveness of an acute session of SIT by improving affect, motivation, and enjoyment, and to examine the effects of music on performance. METHODS: Twenty moderately active adults (22 Â± 4 yr) unfamiliar with interval exercise completed an acute session of SIT under two different conditions: music and no music.
