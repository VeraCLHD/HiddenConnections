All of the eligible measurements during follow-up were modeled using generalized linear regression clustered by participant and adjusted for demographics, 24-hour urinary sodium, kidney function, and selected medications. Results Higher NEAP was associated with lower serum bicarbonate in a graded fashion (P trend < 0.001). Serum bicarbonate was 1.27 mEq/L lower among those in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of NEAP (P < 0.001).
