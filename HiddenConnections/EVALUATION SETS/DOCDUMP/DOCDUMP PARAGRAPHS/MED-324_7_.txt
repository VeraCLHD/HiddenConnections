A significantly decreased risk with renal cell carcinoma was observed in overall cruciferous vegetables consumption group (RR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.83) and subgroup of case-control studies (RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.78), but not in cohort studies (RR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.71-1.21). No heterogeneity and publication bias were detected across studies. Our findings supported that cruciferous vegetables consumption was related to the decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma.
