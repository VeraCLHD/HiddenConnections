Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of meat intake. The covariates included in the models were: age; education; marital status; family history of cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortality only); race; body mass index; 31-level smoking history; physical activity; energy intake; alcohol intake; vitamin supplement use; fruit consumption; vegetable consumption; and menopausal hormone therapy among women.
