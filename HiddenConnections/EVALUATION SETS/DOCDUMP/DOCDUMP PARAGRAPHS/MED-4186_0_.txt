Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the longitudinal age-related changes in human brain volume using stereological methods. METHODS: Sixty-six older participants (34 men, 32 women, age [mean +/- SD] 78.9 +/- 3.3 years, range 74-87 years) with normal baseline and follow-up examinations underwent 2 MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain on average 4.4 years apart. The volumes of the cerebrum (defined as cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and white matter), lateral ventricles, and cerebellum were estimated on the 2 MRIs using an unbiased stereological method (Cavalieri principle).
