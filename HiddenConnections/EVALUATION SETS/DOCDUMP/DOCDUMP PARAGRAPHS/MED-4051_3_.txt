Prior studies suggest characteristic sonographic findings for NAFLD include bright hepatic echoes, increased hepatorenal echogenicity, vascular blurring of portal or hepatic vein and subcutaneous tissue thickness. These sonographic characteristics have not been shown to aid bedside clinicians easily identify potential cases of NAFLD. While sonographic findings such as attenuation of image, diffuse echogenicity, uniform heterogeneous liver, thick subcutaneous depth, and enlarged liver filling of the entire field could be identified by clinicians from bedside ultrasound.
