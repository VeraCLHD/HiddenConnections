Methods and results We conducted a prospective cohort study among 43,685 men from Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 71,243 women from the Nurses' Health Study. Diet and other lifestyle factors were updated from self-reported questionnaires. We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index <25 kg/m 2, ≥30 minutes/day of moderate activity, consuming alcohol modestly (men:5–30g; women:5–15g alcohol/day), and scoring within the top 40% of a healthy diet score.
