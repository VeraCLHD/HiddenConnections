We estimated that âˆ¼5000 deaths from oropharyngeal cancer, 24 000 from esophageal SCC and 5000 from breast cancer were attributable to light drinking in 2004 worldwide. No association was found for colorectum, liver and larynx tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Light drinking increases the risk of cancer of oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus and female breast.
