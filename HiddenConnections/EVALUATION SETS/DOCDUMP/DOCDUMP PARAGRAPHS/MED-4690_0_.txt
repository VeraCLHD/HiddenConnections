Abstract Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is difficult due to ignorance of its pathogenesis. AD patients have defects in phagocytosis of amyloid-beta (1-42) (Abeta) in vitro by the innate immune cells, monocyte/macrophages and in clearance of Abeta plaques [5]. The natural product curcuminoids enhanced brain clearance of Abeta in animal models.
