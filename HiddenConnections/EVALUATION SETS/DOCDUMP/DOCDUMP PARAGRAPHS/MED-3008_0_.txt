Abstract BACKGROUND: For decades, the coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rate has been four or more times higher in Finland than in France despite comparable intakes of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat. A potential answer to this paradox is provided by this study of 40 countries and the analyses of other nutrients in the diets besides cholesterol and saturated fat. METHODS AND RESULTS: CHD death rates for men aged 55 to 64 years were derived from the World Health Organization annual vital statistics.
