Abstract Because of the central role of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in cell survival and proliferation in human multiple myeloma (MM), we explored the possibility of using it as a target for MM treatment by using curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an agent known to have very little or no toxicity in humans. We found that NF-kappaB was constitutively active in all human MM cell lines examined and that curcumin, a chemopreventive agent, down-regulated NF-kappaB in all cell lines as indicated by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay and prevented the nuclear retention of p65 as shown by immunocytochemistry. All MM cell lines showed consitutively active IkappaB kinase (IKK) and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation.
