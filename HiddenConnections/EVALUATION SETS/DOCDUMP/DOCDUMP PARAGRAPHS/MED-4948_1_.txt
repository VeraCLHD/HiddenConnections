In this study, sporamin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in Tca8113 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Consistently, Bax was up-regulated and Bcl-2 was down-regulated in sporamin-treated cells. Furthermore, Akt/GSK-3 signaling was down-regulated in sporamin-treated cells.
