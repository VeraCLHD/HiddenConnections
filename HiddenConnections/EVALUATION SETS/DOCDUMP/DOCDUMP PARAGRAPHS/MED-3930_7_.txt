Results: A total of 191 patients were recruited and 96% completed the study. Fifty two per cent of patients relapsed. Consumption of meat (odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.3–7.8)), particularly red and processed meat (OR 5.19 (95% CI 2.1–12.9)), protein (OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.25–7.19)), and alcohol (OR 2.71 (95% CI 1.1–6.67)) in the top tertile of intake increased the likelihood of relapse compared with the bottom tertile of intake.
