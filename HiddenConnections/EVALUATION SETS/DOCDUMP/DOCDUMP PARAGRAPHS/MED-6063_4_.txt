Consumption of the high-fat diet significantly decreased taste sensitivity to C18:1 among lean subjects (P<0.05), with no change in sensitivity among OW/OB persons (P=0.609). The hedonic ratings for several RF and LF foods differed following the diets. CONCLUSION: Alterations in the fat content of the diet modulated taste sensitivity to C18:1 among lean subjects, which was increased following a 4-week period of fat restriction and attenuated following the high-fat diet.
