The combination index (CI) was used to assess the combined action of the drugs. CIs <1, =1 and >1 indicated synergism, additiveness and antagonism respectively. Cellular accumulation of platinum and platinum-DNA binding levels from Cis and its combination with the phytochemicals were determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry.
