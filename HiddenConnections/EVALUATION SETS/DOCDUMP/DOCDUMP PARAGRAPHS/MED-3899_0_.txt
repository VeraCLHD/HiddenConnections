Abstract Background: Exposure to organochlorines has been examined as a potential risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with inconsistent results that may be related to limited statistical power or to imprecise exposure measurements. Objective: Our purpose was to examine associations between organochlorine concentrations in prediagnostic adipose tissue samples and the risk of NHL. Methods: We conducted a caseâ€“cohort study using a prospective Danish cohort of 57,053 persons enrolled between 1993 and 1997.
