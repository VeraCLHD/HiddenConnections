A venous plasma nicotine concentration of 0.87 ng/mL (roughly 125th of the level achieved in typical daily smokers) was associated with 50% occupancy of α4β2* nAChRs. Conclusions Cigarette smoking in amounts used by typical daily smokers leads to nearly complete occupancy of α4β2* nAChRs, indicating that tobacco-dependent smokers maintain α4β2* nAChR saturation throughout the day. Because prolonged binding of nicotine to α4β2* nAChRs is associated with desensitization of these receptors, the extent of receptor occupancy found herein suggests that smoking may lead to withdrawal alleviation by maintaining nAChRs in the desensitized state.
