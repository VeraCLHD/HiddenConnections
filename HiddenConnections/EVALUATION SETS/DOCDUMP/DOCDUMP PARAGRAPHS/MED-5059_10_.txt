The most active women were more likely to survive than the least physically active women (HR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.13–0.59, P < .001). Continuous measures of carotenoids improved survival (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.51–0.89, P = .01). Women in the highest tertile of total carotenoids were more likely to survive those in the lowest (HR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27–0.91, P = .03).
