Participants who consumed ≥800 mg/d of supplementary calcium or ≥18 mg/d of supplementary iron had significantly higher odds of having been diagnosed with glaucoma than did those who had not consumed supplementary calcium or iron, after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–4.76 for calcium; OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.79–8.06 for iron). Concurrent consumption of both calcium and iron above these levels was associated with still greater odds of having been diagnosed with glaucoma (OR 7.24, 95% CI 2.42–21.62). A clear dose–response relationship between quintiles of supplementary calcium or iron intake and glaucoma prevalence was not found.
