Nerve pathology, when available, showed mild changes of segmental demyelination, axonal degeneration, and inflammatory changes. Patients had meaningful improvement of symptoms and electrophysiologic findings with immune therapy and with removal of exposure to aerosolized brain tissue. We postulate that this outbreak is an auto-immune polyradiculoneuropathy triggered by occupational exposure to multiple aerosolized porcine neural tissue antigens that result in neural damage where the blood-nerve barrier is the least robust.
