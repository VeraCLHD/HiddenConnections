Ownership of pets other than cats and dogs was associated with a reduced risk of NHL (OR=0.64,CI=0.55–0.74) and DLCL (OR=0.58,CI=0.47 –0.71). Exposure to cattle for ≥5 years was associated with an increased risk of NHL (OR=1.6,CI=1.0–2.5) as was exposure to pigs for all NHL (OR=1.8,CI=1.2–2.6) and for DLCL (OR=2.0,CI=1.2–3.4). Conclusions The association between animal exposure and NHL warrants further investigation in pooled analyses.
