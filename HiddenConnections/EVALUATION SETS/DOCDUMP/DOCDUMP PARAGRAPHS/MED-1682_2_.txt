During the high-soy diet, participants consumed 2 soy servings of soy milk, tofu, or soy nuts (approximately 50 mg of isoflavones/day); during the low-soy diet, they maintained their usual diet. Six NAF samples were obtained using a FirstCyteÂ© Aspirator. Estradiol (E2) and estrone sulfate (E1S) were assessed in NAF and estrone (E1) in serum only using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays.
