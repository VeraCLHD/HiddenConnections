Abstract Elevated phosphate (P) levels are seen in advanced renal failure and, together with dysregulated calcium, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels, contribute to the complex of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD). Converging evidence from in vitro, clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that increased P is associated with vascular calcification and mortality. When vessels are exposed to high P conditions in vitro, they develop apoptosis, convert to bone-like cells and develop extensive calcification.
