More than 20 invited presenters and panelists considered laboratory methods for measuring vitamin D status, discussed how clinical studies of vitamin D should be evaluated and used in developing recommendations, noted the role of values and preferences in clinical decision-making, debated the current science related to at-risk groups, and described emerging data about health risks of excessive intakes of vitamin D. Eight questions about vitamin D stem from the Conference presentations as well as other expert sources. Published by Elsevier Inc.
