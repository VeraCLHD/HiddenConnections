When multivariate models were used, body mass index, abdomen-hip ratio, and saturated fatty acid intake were statistically significant independent predictors of both fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations, after age, cigarette smoking, and physical activity were adjusted for. If saturated fatty acids as a percentage of total energy were to decrease from 14% to 8%, there would be an 18% decrease in fasting insulin and a 25% decrease in postprandial insulin. These data suggest that overall adiposity, abdominal obesity, and a diet high in saturated fatty acids are independent predictors for both fasting and postprandial insulin concentrations.
