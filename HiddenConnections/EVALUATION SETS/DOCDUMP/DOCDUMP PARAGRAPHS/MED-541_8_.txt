After controlling for potential confounders, none of the calorie-contributing nutrient intakes at baseline was associated with subsequent weight at 6 or 18 months. However, a greater intake of saturated fat at 6 months was associated with higher weight at 18 months (P = 0.002). A greater intake of plant protein at 6 month was marginally associated with lower absolute weight at 18 month (P = 0.069).
