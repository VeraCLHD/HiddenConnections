Abstract We encountered a 62-year-old woman with a progressively worsening sore throat and a sharp lump located in her left upper neck, which appeared several hours before admission. After questioning, she underwent rigid esophagoscopy at a local hospital for suspected fish bone impaction but this gave a negative result. Unusual signs caused us to arrange a computed tomography scan, which showed that a foreign body had penetrated the left sternocleidomastoid muscle to the subcutaneous layer, with extensive emphysema in the neck.
