Abstract In the 1890s the USDA recommended over 110 g dietary protein per day for working men. This was based on Liebig's idea that protein was the source of muscular energy and the observation that protein consumption was higher in the more successful (i.e., affluent) social groups or nations than elsewhere. Chittenden's demonstration of physical energy being maintained on one-half this level of intake then led to reassessment of these standards, and attention was transferred to the discovery of trace nutrients and their practical significance.
