The pattern of BPA concentrations was similar for all participants: they rose near the beginning of the fast (after the pre-fast meal), declined over the next 24h, fluctuated at lower levels during the second day, and then rose after the post-fast meal. Concentrations (~2 μg/g creatine) and calculated BPA intakes (~0.03 μg/kg-day) in these individuals during the first 24h were consistent with general population exposures. For the second 24h, concentrations and intakes declined by about two-thirds.
