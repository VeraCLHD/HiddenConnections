Abstract To determine the burden of Salmonella infections in the United States, Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) investigators conducted population-based active surveillance for culture-confirmed Salmonella infections during 1996-1999 at FoodNet laboratories. In addition, all clinical microbiology FoodNet laboratories were surveyed to determine their practices for isolating Salmonella. Telephone interviews were also conducted among residents of the FoodNet sites to determine the proportion of persons with diarrheal illness who sought medical care and the proportion who submitted stool specimens for bacterial culture.
