RESULTS: Fat-free mass was positively associated with a more alkalinogenic dietary load (comparing quartile 1 vs 4: FFM 0.79 kg P < 0.001, FFM% 1.06 % <0.001, FFMI 0.24 kg/m² P = 0.002), and with the ratio of fruits and vegetables to potential acidogenic foods. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a small but significant positive association between a more alkaline diet and muscle mass indexes in healthy women that was independent of age, physical activity and protein intake equating to a scale of effect between a fifth and one half of the observed relationship with 10 years of age. Although protein is important for maintenance of muscle mass, eating fruits and vegetables that supply adequate amounts of potassium and magnesium are also relevant.
