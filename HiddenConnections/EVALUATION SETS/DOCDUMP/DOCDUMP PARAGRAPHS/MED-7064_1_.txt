Postulated consequences of low DHEA levels include insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, reduction of the immune defence system as well as psychosocial problems such as depression and a general deterioration in the sensation of well-being and cognitive function. Clinically, the spectrum of women that would benefit from DHEA therapy is not clearly defined and nor is the dosage of hormone treatment. Whether DHEA therapy could be prescribed as a general anti-aging therapy or could be an alternative treatment for women suffering from androgen deficiency syndrome remains uncertain across studies.
