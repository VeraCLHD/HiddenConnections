Heterogeneity in patient populations (e.g. extent of fainting-proneness), differential targeting of BII phobia manifestations, and small sample sizes may explain some of the variability in findings. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of treatment techniques for BII phobia patients with and without fainting history.
