Abstract Seven patients with Parkinson's disease who experienced severe motor fluctuations in response to levodopa were studied in detail with relation to the effect of dietary protein on their motor function. The levodopa dose for each patient was not changed during the period of study, and no other antiparkinsonian drugs were used. Regular and high-protein diets resulted in a marked elevation in the plasma concentrations of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) that are known to compete with levodopa for transport across the blood-brain barrier.
