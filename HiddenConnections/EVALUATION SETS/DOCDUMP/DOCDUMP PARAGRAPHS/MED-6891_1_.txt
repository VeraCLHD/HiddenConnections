However, data on the relationship between diet and the parameters of skin conditions are scarce. The present study aimed to examine the associations of biophysical properties of the skin of women with intakes of fats and antioxidant micronutrients as well as food groups as sources of these nutrients. In a cross-sectional study, we measured the hydration, surface lipids and elasticity of the skin of 716 Japanese women using non-invasive techniques.
