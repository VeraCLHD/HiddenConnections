The potency of garlic in inhibiting the collagen-induced platelet aggregation is approximately similar to that of rabbit platelets (8.8 mg ml(-1) produced 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation). The results of this study show that garlic is about 13 times more potent than onion in inhibiting platelet aggregation and suggest that garlic and onion could be more potent inhibitors of blood platelet aggregation if consumed in raw than in cooked or boiled form.
