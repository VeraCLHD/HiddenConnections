Abstract BACKGROUND: Vitamin B(12) deficiency can occur in individuals with dietary patterns that exclude animal foods and patients who are unable to absorb vitamin B(12 )in food. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Our clinic serves a high-income population living in Southern Israel. We hypothesize that a tendency to decrease of level of vitamin B(12) in our population is caused by a premeditated decrease in consumption of animal products.
