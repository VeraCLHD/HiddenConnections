Similar associations were observed for the likelihood of using multivitamins with other supplements; however, men with higher physical activity, history of cancer, hypertension, higher consumption of nuts, and lower consumption of red meat and coffee were also more likely to use multivitamins with other supplements (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Self-reported multivitamin use associated with lifestyle, clinical and dietary factors may be an indicator of healthy behaviors. These results provide important information for the interpretation of the recent findings from the PHS II trial and consideration of results from observational studies of multivitamin use and chronic disease.
