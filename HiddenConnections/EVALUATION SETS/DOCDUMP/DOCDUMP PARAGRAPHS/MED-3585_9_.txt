We found no association between dietary fiber intake and diverticulosis (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.71â€“1.30) in comparing the highest quartile to the lowest (mean intake 25 versus 8 g/day). Conclusions In our cross-sectional, colonoscopy-based study, neither constipation nor a low-fiber diet was associated with an increased risk of diverticulosis.
