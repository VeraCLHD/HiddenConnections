Recently, the redistribution in coronary blood flow (CBF) was suggested as a possible mechanism. METHODS: Twenty young, healthy volunteer controls and 20 patients with significant stenosis in the left anterior descending (LAD) or left main coronary artery were enrolled in the study. Coronary blood flow was evaluated in the distal LAD by using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after food intake.
