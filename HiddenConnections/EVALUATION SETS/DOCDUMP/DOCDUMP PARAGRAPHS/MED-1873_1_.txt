In the HCT 116 cell line, butyrate-induced growth inhibition is almost fully reversible, whereas in the VACO 5 cell line, a subpopulation undergoes apoptosis within 30 hr of treatment with butyrate. Concurrent treatment of VACO 5 cells with butyrate and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) accelerates and increases the incidence of cell death to nearly 100% of the population, whereas HCT 116 cells largely remain alive during treatment with this combination. The action of butyrate as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase was assessed in these cell lines by examining extracted core histones for their electrophoretic mobility in Triton/acid/urea gels.
