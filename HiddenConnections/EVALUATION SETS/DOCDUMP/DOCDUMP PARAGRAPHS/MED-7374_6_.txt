The true incidence of SCA and/or SCD in the U.S. remains unclear with a wide range in the available estimates, which are badly dated. As reliable estimates of SCD incidence are important for improving risk stratification and prevention, future efforts are clearly needed to establish uniform definitions of SCA and SCD and then to prospectively and precisely capture cases of SCA and SCD in the overall U.S. population.
