Brown and white rice contained lower quantities of phytochemicals, in the form of flavones/flavonols (21-24 μg/g) and γ-oryzanol (12.3-8.2 μg/g), together with trace levels of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin. Neither anthocyanins nor procyanidins were detected in brown and white rice. By describing the profile of the heterogeneous mixture of phytochemicals present in different rice varieties, this study provides a basis for defining the potential health effects related to pigmented and nonpigmented rice consumption by humans.
