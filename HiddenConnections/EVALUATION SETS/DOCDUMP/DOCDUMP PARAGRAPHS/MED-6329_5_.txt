: -16.0; p = 0.01) and increased the risk of miscarriage (OR: 14.3; p = 0.03). Physical activity positively affected implantation (Coef.: 9.4; p = 0.009), increased the chance of pregnancy (OR: 1.83; p = 0.013) and tended to decrease the risk of miscarriage (OR: 0.30; p = 0.068). In addition, an inverse correlation was found between physical activity and BMI, and a direct correlation was found between soft-drink consumption and BMI.
