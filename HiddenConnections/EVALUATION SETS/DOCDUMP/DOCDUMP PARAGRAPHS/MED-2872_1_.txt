Unfortunately, in some patients, the poor palatability and the high cost of the protein-free substitutes, together with difficulties in following the diet away from home, can make good compliance difficult, possibly causing low energy intake and malnutrition.

This is possible thanks to an appropriate cereal-legume mixture, supplying proteins complementary for essential amino acids.
