We compared the dietary habits and food intakes of the two groups using an adaptation of the Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire (AFFQ). Question form included a list of 65 food items formed from five main food groups (grain, meat and alternatives, dairy products, vegetables-fruits and fat) and 25 dietary habits. The data were evaluated by binary logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Student's t, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-square tests.
