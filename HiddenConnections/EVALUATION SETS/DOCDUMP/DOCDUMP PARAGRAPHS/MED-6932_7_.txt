Protocols were repeated thrice for each volunteer. The study revealed rapid human AFB1 uptake (plasma ka, 5.05 ± 1.10 h−1; Tmax, 1.0 hour) and urinary elimination (95% complete by 24 hours) kinetics. Chla and CHL treatment each significantly impeded AFB1 absorption and reduced Cmax and AUCs (plasma and urine) in one or more subjects.
