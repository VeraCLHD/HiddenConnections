Higher fish consumption was independently associated with lower SI-adjusted AIR (β=−0.13 [−0.25, −0.016], p=0.03, comparing ≥ 2 vs. <2 portions/week). Fish consumption was positively associated with intact and split proinsulin/C-peptide ratios, however, these associations were confounded by ethnicity (multivariable-adjusted β=0.073 [−0.014, 0.16] for intact proinsulin/C-peptide ratio, β=0.031 [−0.065, 0.13] for split proinsulin/C-peptide ratio). We also observed a significant positive association between fish consumption and fasting blood glucose (multivariable-adjusted β=2.27 [0.68, 3.86], p=0.005).
