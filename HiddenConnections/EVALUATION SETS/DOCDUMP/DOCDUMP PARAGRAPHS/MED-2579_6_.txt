There was no effect of supplementation on primary outcomes [distractibility mean difference: −0.2 s (95% CI: −0.7, 0.4 s); WMIC mean difference: 8.9 mm (95% CI: −10.6, 28.3 mm)]. There was no difference between DHA-supplemented and control groups except that treatment-group children looked away from the toys fewer times than controls when presented with multiple toys competing for attention but less accurately remembered a repeated hiding location. These secondary effects were not consistent with any other outcomes and may have been a result of chance.
