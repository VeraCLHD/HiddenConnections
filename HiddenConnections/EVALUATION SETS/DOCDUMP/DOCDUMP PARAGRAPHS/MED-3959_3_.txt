Patient and hospital variables were used in the LASSO algorithm for logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation to build a predictive model for colectomy requirement and mortality after colectomy. The association of colectomy day with mortality was also examined on multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: An estimated 2,773,521 discharges with a diagnosis of CDC were identified in the US over a decade.
