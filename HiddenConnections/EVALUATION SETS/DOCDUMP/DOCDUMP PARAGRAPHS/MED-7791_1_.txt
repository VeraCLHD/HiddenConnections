Twenty-nine compounds, including triterpenoids, flavonoids, organic acids and plant sterols, were isolated using gradient solvent fractionation, Diaion HP-20, silica gel, and ODS columns, and preparative HPLC. Their chemical structures were identified using HR-MS and 1D and 2D NMR. Antiproliferative activities of isolated pure compounds against HepG2 human liver cancer cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were evaluated.
