In addition, when we modeled heme iron in seven categories, the multivariate RR comparing women who consumed > or =2.25 mg/day and those with intake <0.75 mg/day was 1.52 (1.22-1.88). The association between heme iron and the risk of diabetes was significant in both overweight and lean women. CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort study suggests that higher heme iron intake is associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
