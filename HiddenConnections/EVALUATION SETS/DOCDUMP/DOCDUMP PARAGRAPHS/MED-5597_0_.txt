Abstract Type 1 diabetes is increasing rapidly in many parts of the Western world, most evidently in Scandinavia. A low concordance rate of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus among monozygotic twins clearly indicates that genetic risk factors may be necessary, but are not sufficient for the disease to occur. The strongest genetic risk markers are located in the HLA region of chromosome 6, but these DNA specificities differ in different populations.
