Many of these organisms contained multiple, strongly periodic acid-Schiff, Gomori methenamine-silver, and Gridley fungus-positive granules in the cytoplasm. The organisms in tissue did not stain with fluorescent antibody conjugates specific for the two known pathogenic Prototheca species. In some organisms, electron microscopy revealed membranous cytoplasmic profiles considered to be remnants of degenerated chloroplasts.
