RESULTS: At the end of the experiment, the control group lost an average of 15% of fat mass (P<0.05) and 2.5% of weight (P<0.05), whereas the experimental group lost 11% of fat mass and 1.2% of weight (P<0.05). Consumption of orange juice by the experimental group was associated with increased dietary intake of vitamin C and folate by 126% and 61% respectively. Serum LDL-C decreased 15% (P<0.05) and HDL-C increased 18% (P<0.05) in the experimental group, but no significant change was observed in the control group.
