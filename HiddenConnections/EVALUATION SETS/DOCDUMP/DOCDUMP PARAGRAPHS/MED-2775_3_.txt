The aim of this study was to analyse the content of selected purine derivates and amino acid profile in the three insect species most often used for entomophagy in Europe and compare them with the purine content in egg white and chicken breast. RESULTS: The content of individual purine derivates and their total content were significantly dependent on insect species. The purine content in all three species was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in egg white, but some values were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in chicken breast.
