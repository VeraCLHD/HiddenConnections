The ratio unsaturated/saturated dietary fat increased by 40% to 50% when almonds were included in the diet. CONCLUSION: Incorporating a modest quantity (76 kJ) of almonds in the diet each day for six months did not lead on average to statistically or biologically significant changes in body weight and did increase the consumption of unsaturated fats. Further studies are necessary to evaluate longer term effects, especially in men.
