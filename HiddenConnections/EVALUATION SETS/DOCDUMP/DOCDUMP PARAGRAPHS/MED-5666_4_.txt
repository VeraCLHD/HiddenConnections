Observed tendencies for lower protein and fat and higher lactose concentrations in the macrobiotic group were not statistically significant. Concentrations of vitamin B12, HCB and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180) were lower in the macrobiotic group. After adjustment for confounding variables, meat and fish consumption, but not dairy products, contributed to vitamin B12 concentrations.
