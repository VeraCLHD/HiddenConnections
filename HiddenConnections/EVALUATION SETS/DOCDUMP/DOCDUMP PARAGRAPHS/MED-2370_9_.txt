RHR was inversely related to physical fitness (p<0.001). Overall, increasing RHR was highly associated with mortality in a graded manner after adjusting for physical fitness, leisure-time physical activity and other cardiovascular risk factors. Compared to men with RHR â‰¤50, those with RHR >90 had an HR (95% CI) of 3.06 (1.97 to 4.75).
