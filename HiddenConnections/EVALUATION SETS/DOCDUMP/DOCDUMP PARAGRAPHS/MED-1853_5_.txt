Fecal concentrations and daily excretion of short-chain fatty acids were not different in the two study periods. During the high-RS diet, bacterial beta-glucosidase activity decreased by 26% (P < or = 0.05). Fecal concentrations of total and secondary bile acids were significantly lower during the high-RS than during the low-RS period [a decrease of 30% (P < or = 0.05) and 32% (P < or = 0.01), respectively, in total and secondary bile acids] whereas concentrations of primary bile acids were unaffected by RS consumption.
