Abstract Changes in the concentration and composition of serum VLDL, LDL, and HDL were studied in rabbits transferred from Chow diets to cholesterol-free, semipurified diets containing casein or isolated soy protein. During the first week on the casein diet, there was a marked increase in LDL-cholesterol and these higher levels were maintained during the subsequent 3 weeks of the study. Similar but less marked changes were obtained with the soy protein diet.
