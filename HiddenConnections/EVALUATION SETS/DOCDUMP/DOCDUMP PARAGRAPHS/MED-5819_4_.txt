All sensory attributes were scored in the low intensity range (1.5 to 5.0). Brothy, vinegar, and residual particles were the only individual attributes rated significantly different (P < or = 0.05) due to treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that all sensory attributes formed 2 dimensions that explained 57% of variation in the data.
