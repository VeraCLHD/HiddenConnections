We used a strict definition of depression that required both self-reported physician-diagnosed depression and use of antidepressants, and a broader definition that included women who reported either clinical diagnosis or antidepressant use. Results During the 12-year follow-up, we documented 2,594 incident cases of depression using the stricter definition and 6,446 using the broader definition. After adjustment for body mass index and other potential confounders, relative risks comparing extreme quintiles of the inflammatory dietary pattern were 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22, 1.63; P-trend <.001) for the strict definition and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 1.41; P-trend <.001) for the broader definition of depression.
