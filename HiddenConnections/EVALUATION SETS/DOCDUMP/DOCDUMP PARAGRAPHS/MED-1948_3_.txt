This study examines trials of subjects with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and constipation who are receiving a drug intervention deemed of merit by the American College of Gastroenterology task force and compares these therapies to examine the number needed to harm using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHODS: Potential studies of irritable bowel syndrome treatments were identified through a search of MEDLINE (1950 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to April 2011), the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and the bibliography of recent meta-analyses. Clinical trials of pharmacotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome were eligible for inclusion only if a description of adverse events and the number of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events were reported.
