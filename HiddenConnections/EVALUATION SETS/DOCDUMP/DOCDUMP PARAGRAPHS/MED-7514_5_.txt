Enzyme activity estimates were calculated by using specific urinary steroid metabolite ratios. RESULTS: Of the nutrition-relevant predictors, FM (P < 0.0001) explained most of the variation of AA secretion (R(2) = 5%). Animal protein intake was also positively associated with AA secretion (P < 0.05), which explained 1% of its variation.
