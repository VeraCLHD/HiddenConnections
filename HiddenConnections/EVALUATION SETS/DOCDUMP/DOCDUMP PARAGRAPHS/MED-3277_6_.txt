RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up, 116 participants had progressed to dementia due to AD, while 223 remained in the MCI stage. Participants with moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis had a faster decline in cognition and function relative to participants without such stenosis. The presence of moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis significantly increased the risk of dementia progression, even after controlling for age, sex, education, vascular risk factors, and silent MRI lesions.
