RESULTS: Established risk factors for the development of BO include gastro-esophageal reflux, obesity, male gender, Caucasian ethnicity, and increasing age. Smoking might increase the risk of BO, while aspirin/NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori infection, and specific "healthy" dietary factors may lower the risk. The potential value of using chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors, aspirin/NSAIDs, or statins is still uncertain.
