Abstract We assessed the association between blood methylmercury (MeHg) and cognitive function in 240 adult residents living near a deserted chloralkali plant. Total mercury (T-Hg) in the blood, MeHg, and health and dietary related questionnaire were examined for all participants. The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI C-2.0) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess the participants' cognitive functions.
