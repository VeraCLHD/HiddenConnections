Although there was a significant weight loss for the group with NIDDM, resulting in the decrease in body mass index, 8 of 9 patients who were initially overweight were still overweight at the end of the program, and 5 of the 8 were still obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2), indicating that normalization of body weight is not a requisite for a reduction or normalization of other risk factors. Insulin was reduced from 18.2 +/- 1.8 to 11.6 +/- 1.2 microU/ml in the insulin-resistant group, with 17 of the 29 subjects achieving normal fasting insulin (less than 10 microU/ml).
