Three antisera were characterized in detail: anti-C7-carboxy-propyloxy-2S-(-)-8-PN (anti-H-11), anti-C7-carboxy-propyloxy-2R-(+)-8-PN (anti-H-10), and anti-C4'-carboxy-methoxy-rac-8-PN (anti-H-25). anti-H-10 and anti-H-11 showed about 9% enantiomeric cross-reactivity, and anti-H-11 did not discriminate between isoxanthohumol (IX) and 8-PN (84% cross-reactivity). For anti-H-10, cross-reactivities in the range of 2-5% were found for xanthohumol, IX, and 6-prenylnaringenin.
