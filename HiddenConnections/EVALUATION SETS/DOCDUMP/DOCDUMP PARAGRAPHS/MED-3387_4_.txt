On 1 day, the volunteers consumed large (>2000 μm) rice particles, and on the second day, small rice particles (500-1000 μm). Subsequently, gastric emptying using the sodium [(13)C] acetate breath test (for 240 minutes) and GR and IR (for 120 minutes) from finger-prick blood samples were measured. The incremental area under the curve (IAUC) for the GR for small particles varied 45% more compared with whole rice.
