Amylase inhibition in rowanberry was recovered in a fraction enriched in proanthocyanidins (PACs). Inhibition was ameliorated by bovine serum albumin, suggesting that PACs acted by binding to amylase. Co-incubation of rowanberry PACs with acarbose reduced the concentration of acarbose required for effective amylase inhibition.
