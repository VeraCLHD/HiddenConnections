Adjudicated functional GI hospitalizations in one study were calcium 6.8%, placebo 3.6% (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.21-3.05, p = 0.006). Direct comparison of self-reported and adjudicated MI events in the two trials of dietary calcium supplementation showed self-reported MI rates of 3.6% in the calcium group and 2.1% in the placebo group. After adjudication the MI rates were 2.4% in the calcium group and 1.6% in the placebo group (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.88-2.45, p = 0.145).
