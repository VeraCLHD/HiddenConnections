RS is defined as the total amount of starch and the products of starch degradation that resists digestion in the small intestine of healthy people, and the class is comprised of many chemically and physically distinct entities. Some forms of RS are present naturally in many foods, and average global consumption is estimated at 3-10 g/day. Among the best-characterized forms of RS are those derived from high-amylose maize (HAM).
