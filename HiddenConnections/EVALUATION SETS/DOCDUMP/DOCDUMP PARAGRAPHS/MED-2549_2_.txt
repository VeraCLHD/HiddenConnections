Results PD was inversely associated with consumption of all edible Solanaceae combined (relative risk [RR]=0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–1.01 per time per day), but not consumption of all other vegetables combined (RR=1.00, 95% CI 0.92–1.10). The trend strengthened when we weighted edible Solanaceae by nicotine concentration (ptrend=0.004). An inverse association was also evident for peppers specifically (ptrend=0.005).
