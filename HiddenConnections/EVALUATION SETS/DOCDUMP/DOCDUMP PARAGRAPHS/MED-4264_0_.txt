Abstract OBJECTIVES: To justify the effects of Mentha piperita labiatae and Mentha spicata labiatae herbal teas on plasma total testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels and testicular histologic features. We performed this study because of major complaints in our area from men about the adverse effects of these herbs on male reproductive function. METHODS: The experimental study included 48 male Wistar albino rats (body weight 200 to 250 g).
