Whether AGD is related to semen quality in human is unknown. Objective: We examined associations between AGD and semen parameters in adult males. Methods: We used multiple regression analyses to model the relationships between sperm parameters and two alternative measures of AGD [from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (AGDAS) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (AGDAP)] in 126 volunteers in Rochester, New York.
