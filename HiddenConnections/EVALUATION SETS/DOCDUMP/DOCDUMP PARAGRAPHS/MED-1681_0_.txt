Abstract There is evidence that certain phytoestrogens inhibit aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens to oestrogens. Kinetic studies in cell-free preparations show that they may inhibit aromatase by competitive binding to the enzyme, but there is a paucity of studies investigating longer-term effects of phytoestrogens on the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. This study tested the hypothesis that phytoestrogens could reduce aromatase activity by down-regulation of its expression.
