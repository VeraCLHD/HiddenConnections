In contrast, data regarding how developmental exposures impact the susceptibility of the immune system to functional alterations later in life are surprisingly scant. Given that the immune system forms an integrated network that detects and destroys invading pathogens and cancer cells, it provides the bodyâ€™s first line of defense. Thus, the consequences of early-life exposures that reduce immune function are profound.
