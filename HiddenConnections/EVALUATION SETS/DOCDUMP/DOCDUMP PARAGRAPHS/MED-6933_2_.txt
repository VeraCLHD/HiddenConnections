We present some of the molecular pathways that underpin the broad biological processes involved in carcinogenesis. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and the evasion of apoptosis are important biological mechanisms by which carcinogenesis occurs. Subsequently, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic activity represent important activities for preventing, suppressing, or reversing the development of carcinogenesis.
