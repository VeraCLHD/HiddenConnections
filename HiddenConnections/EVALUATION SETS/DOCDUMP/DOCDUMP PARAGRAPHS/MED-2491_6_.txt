The serum PTX3 concentration was not related to waist circumference (r=0.27, p=0.20), waist circumference/hip ratio (r=0.25, p=0.16), BMI (r=0.04, p=0.80) and lipid profiles, respectively. Among the parameters determining metabolic syndrome, an increasing visceral fat area had the strongest association with PTX3 concentrations. Conclusion In patients with STEMI, PTX3 is associated with central obesity and it is significantly and independently correlated with visceral fat area.
