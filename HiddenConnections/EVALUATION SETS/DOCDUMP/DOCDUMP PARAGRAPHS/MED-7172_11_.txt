Multiple regression analysis identified age, body mass index, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides as independent predictors of FSFI score. CONCLUSIONS: Women with hyperlipidemia have significantly lower FSFI-domain scores as compared with age-matched women without hyperlipidemia. HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were independently associated with the FSFI score.
