Increased glomerular basement membrane permeability leads to loss of lipoprotein lipase activators, resulting in hyperlipidaemia. Circulating low-density lipoprotein binds with glycosaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane and increases its permeability. Filtered lipoprotein accumulates in mesangial cells and stimulates them to proliferate and produce excess basement membrane material.
