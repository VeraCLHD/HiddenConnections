We studied 12 woman who were all members of a religious community that eliminates all animal products from the diet and uses soybeans and grains for proteins. Samples of breast milk were gathered in August 1979 and were analyzed for 17 chemical substances. The lipid levels in the vegetarian sample were similar to levels reported in the literature (mean, 4.23%, range, 1.23-7.4%).
