In the breast, ERalpha promotes epithelial proliferation, whereas ERbeta has a restraining influence in this regard - consistent with the emerging view that soy isoflavones do not increase breast cancer risk, and possibly may diminish it. Premenopausal women enjoy a relative protection from kidney failure; since ERbeta is an antagonist of TGF-beta signaling in mesangial cells, soy isoflavones may have nephroprotective potential. Estrogen also appears to protect women from left ventricular hypertrophy, and recent evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by ERbeta.
