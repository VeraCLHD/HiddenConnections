Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between retinal artery disease and cerebral small-vessel disease (SVD). METHODS: In a prospective cohort of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, the authors performed retinal photographs and brain MRI. Two ophthalmologists, not aware of the MR results, independently assessed retinal arterial narrowing, crossings, sclerosis, and tortuosity according to standard scoring lists.
