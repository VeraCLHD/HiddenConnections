VcPP inhibited GtfB activity associated with the synthesis of water-insoluble glucans. It also inhibited GtfD activity associated with the synthesis of water-soluble glucans at a concentration which was lower than that used for inhibition of GtfB. VcPP had no effect on acidification associated with glucose utilization by S. mutans.
