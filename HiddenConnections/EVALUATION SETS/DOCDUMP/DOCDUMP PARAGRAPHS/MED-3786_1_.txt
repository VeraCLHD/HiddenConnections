It has been hypothesised that a low bacterial diet (LBD) can prevent the occurrence of infections and (infection-related) mortality in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia, but much remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of an LBD versus a control diet in preventing the occurrence of infection and to decrease (infection-related) mortality in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia. Secondary objectives were to assess the time to first febrile episode, the need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability and quality of life.
