In all, 21 metabolites were measured in a total of 118 urine events, including events before and after the fasting period. At the onset of the study all phthalate metabolite concentrations were consistent with levels found in previous general population studies. Metabolites of the HMW phthalates (DEHP, DiNP and DiDP) showed a rapid decline to levels 5-10 times lower than initial levels within 24h of the fast and remained low thereafter.
