Nearly half of mothers with the common cold had secondary complications with antifever therapy. The comparison of cases with 25 congenital abnormalities and population control mothers with medically recorded common cold during the second and third months of gestation showed that five congenital abnormality groups: congenital hydrocephaly (3.6, 1.3-9.7), cleft lip+/-palate (2.3, 1.5-3.6), posterior cleft palate (2.3, 1.2-4.1), limb deficiencies (2.2, 1.1-4.1) and multiple CAs (2.0, 1.4-2.9) had adjusted POR 2 or more. The comparison of cases with different congenital abnormalities and malformed controls (including offspring with Down syndrome) as referent, indicated a higher prevalence of the common cold during the second and third month of gestation only in the mothers of cases with cleft lip+/-palate (adjusted POR: 1.7 with 95% CI: 1.2-2.5), however, congenital hydrocephaly, neural-tube defects and multiple CAs had also mothers with a somewhat higher occurrence of the common cold.
