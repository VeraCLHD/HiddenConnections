Wider retinal venular caliber, in contrast, is associated with younger age; impaired fasting glucose and diabetes; dyslipidemia; obesity; systemic marker of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cigarette smoking; and predicts the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. New data from family and twin studies indicate a significant genetic contribution to retinal vascular caliber, an area that is under investigation. Elucidating the complete range of systemic, environmental, and genetic factors linked with retinal vascular caliber changes may provide critical insight into the etiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of early vascular disease not only in the eye but elsewhere in the body.
