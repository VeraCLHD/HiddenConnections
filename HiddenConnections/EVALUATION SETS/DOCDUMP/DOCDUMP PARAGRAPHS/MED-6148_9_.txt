When the same threshold of <13 cm/seconds was chosen, PSV before SPECT was predictive of ICFR with an accuracy of 80% (area under the ROC curve = 0.798 +/- 0.10; P < 0.05). After adjustment for confounders, anxiety symptoms were related to dynamic PSV (Adj. r = -0.154, P < 0.05) but not to flaccid PSV. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that flow in the cavernosal arteries can be routinely evaluated by PCDU in the flaccid state.
