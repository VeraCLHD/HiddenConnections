The eligible study subjects received either L. gasseri A5 (n = 49) or a placebo (n = 56) daily for 2 months. Pulmonary function tests were performed, and the clinical severity of asthma and AR was evaluated by the attending physicians in the study period. Diary cards with records of the day- and nighttime peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), symptoms of asthma, and AR scores of the patients were used for measuring the outcome of the treatment.
