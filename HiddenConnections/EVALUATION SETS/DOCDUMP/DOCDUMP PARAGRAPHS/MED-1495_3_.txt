Capsaicin (75 micrograms) was more potent than methacholine (50 mg) in producing nasal secretion, while topical histamine (200 micrograms), substance P (135 micrograms) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (36 micrograms) did not induce rhinorrhea. 2. Pretreatment with either topical ipratropium bromide, systemic dexchlorpheniramine or indomethacin did not influence the effects induced by capsaicin.
