Twelve healthy sedentary men were studied in 1985-86 (T1) and nine (initial mean age 65.4 +/- 4.2 yr) were reevaluated in 1997-98 (T2). Isokinetic muscle strength of the knee and elbow extensors and flexors showed losses (P < 0.05) ranging from 20 to 30% at slow and fast angular velocities. Computerized tomography (n = 7) showed reductions (P < 0.05) in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the thigh (12.5%), all thigh muscles (14.7%), quadriceps femoris muscle (16.1%), and flexor muscles (14.
