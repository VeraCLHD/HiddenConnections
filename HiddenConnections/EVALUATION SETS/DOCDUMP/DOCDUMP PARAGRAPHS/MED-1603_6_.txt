This way, we identified sulfo-carrabiose as a potent molecule for trapping spermine and spermidine. These virtual results were first confirmed in tubo where sulfo-carrabiose was shown to dose-dependently inactivate spermine and spermidine. In vitro, adipocytes cultured with sulfo-carrabiose exhibited a significant reduction of lipogenesis and a significant increase of lipolysis.
