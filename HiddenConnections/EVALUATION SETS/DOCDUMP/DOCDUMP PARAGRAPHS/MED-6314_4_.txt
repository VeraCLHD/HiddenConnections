The glycemic responses to breakfast were significantly lower on mornings after low-GI dinners than after high-GI dinners. Eating, at dinner, foods with different fiber contents but the same GI had no effect on postbreakfast glycemia. We conclude that the GI predicts the difference between glycemic responses of mixed dinner meals; breakfast carbohydrate tolerance is improved when low-GI foods are eaten the previous evening.
