Abstract BACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to preformed N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) and endogenous NOCs. Several NOCs are potential human carcinogens, including N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), but evidence from population studies is inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between dietary NOCs (NDMA), the endogenous NOC index, and dietary nitrite and cancer incidence in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk, United Kingdom, study.
