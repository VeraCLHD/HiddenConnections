Chitin, chitosan, and their oligomers are able to act as elicitors which induce enhanced levels of chitinases in various plants. Lectins which bind to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine strongly interfere with fungal and insect chitin synthases. Plant lectins with similar properties may be involved in plant-pathogen interaction inter alia by suppressing fungal invasion.
