After the administration of egg yolk, plasma CCK levels increased from 12.4 +/- 4.5 to 25.3 +/- 12.0 pg/ml in normal subjects. In group A, plasma CCK levels increased from 17.9 +/- 8.5 to 39.3 +/- 14.2 pg/ml, and in group B, from 15.2 +/- 5.1 to 38.3 +/- 9.9 pg/ml. In group C, however, plasma CCK levels increased from 33.1 +/- 13.9 to 72.4 +/- 31.9 pg/ml, and fasting CCK levels and responses to egg yolk were significantly higher than those in normal subjects and in groups A and B (p less than 0.01-0.05).
