Abstract Commercial aqueous wood-smoke flavouring induced significant increases in the 6-thioguanine resistance mutation frequency of TK6 human lymphoblasts at 0.1 microliter flavouring/ml of cell suspension. This corresponds to 6 micrograms/ml of dissolved 'solids' as determined by fully drying the aqueous flavouring in a vacuum desiccator. In AHH-1 human lymphoblasts, which contain a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system, mutations were induced at 0.3 microliter/ml, corresponding to 18 microliters/ml of dissolved 'solids'.
