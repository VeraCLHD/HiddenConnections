Here, we used a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis to examine whether the diet-induced or pharmacologically induced changes in plasma cholesterol that result in altered brain amyloidosis also affect ApoE content in liver and in brain. We found that chronic changes in total cholesterol in plasma lead to changes in ApoE mRNA levels in brain. We also found that cholesterol loading of primary glial cells increases cellular and secreted ApoE levels and that long-term treatment of astrocytes and microglia with statins leads to a decrease in the cellular and/or secreted ApoE.
