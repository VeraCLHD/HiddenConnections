All compounds tested dose-dependently reduced mean mRNA(arom) compared with controls. Apigenin was the most potent inhibitor with significant inhibition of mRNA(arom) seen at both 10 microM and 100 nM, whilst other flavonoids (except biochanin A) only induced significant inhibition (p<or=0.05) at the higher dose. Low dose (100 nM) mixtures of the compounds were ineffective except for a combination of the three isoflavones that induced a significant inhibition of mRNA(arom).
