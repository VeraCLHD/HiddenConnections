All urine was collected in intervals during the 48 h period after ingestion of the cruciferous vegetables. Total ITC in the cruciferous mixture and total ITC and their metabolites in urine was quantified as the cyclocondensation product of 1,2-bezenedithiol by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The total urinary excretion of ITCs correlated significantly with the two doses of ITC from diets with high or low cruciferous content (r (s )= 0.90, P < 0.01).
