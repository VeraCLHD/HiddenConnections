Abstract Background Parkinson disease is inversely associated with cigarette smoking, but its relation with passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke exposure is rarely examined. Methods Within a case-control study we assessed the association between Parkinson disease and living or working with active smokers. Cases were newly diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease (N=154) from western Washington State in 2002â€“2008.
