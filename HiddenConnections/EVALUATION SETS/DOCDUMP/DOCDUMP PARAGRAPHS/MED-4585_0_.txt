Abstract The effect of dietary factors on manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity in humans has not been studied. We longitudinally evaluated changes in MnSOD activity and other indices of manganese and iron status in 47 women during a 124-d supplementation study. Subjects received one of four treatments: placebo, 60 mg iron, 15 mg manganese, or both mineral supplements daily.
