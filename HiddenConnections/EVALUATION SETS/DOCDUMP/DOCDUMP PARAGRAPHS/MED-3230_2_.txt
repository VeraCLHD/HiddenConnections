It is Aβ that accumulates in the brain lesions that are thought to cause the disease. By reducing the cellular cholesterol level of living hippocampal neurons by 70% with lovastatin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin, we show that the formation of Aβ is completely inhibited while the generation of APPsec is unperturbed. This inhibition of Aβ formation is accompanied by increased solubility in the detergent Triton X-100 and is fully reversible by the readdition of cholesterol to previously depleted cells.
