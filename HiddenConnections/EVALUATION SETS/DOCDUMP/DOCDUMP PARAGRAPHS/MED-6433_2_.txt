We tested whether red wine is a nutritional AI in premenopausal women. Methods In a cross-over design, 36 women (mean age [SD], 36 [8] years) were assigned to 8 ounces (237â€‰mL) of red wine daily then white wine for 1 month each, or the reverse. Blood was collected twice during the menstrual cycle for measurement of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), androstenedione (A), total and free testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).
