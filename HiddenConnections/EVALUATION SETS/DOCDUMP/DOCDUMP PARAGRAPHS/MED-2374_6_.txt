Heart rate was a significant determinant of SCD after adjustment for significant co-morbidities and medications [OR for 10 bpm increase = 1.26; 95% CI (1.14 – 1.38); p<0.0001]. After considering LVSD, resting HR was slightly attenuated but remained significantly associated with SCD (p=0.005). In addition to diabetes, and digoxin as well as pulmonary and renal disease, LVSD was also independently associated with SCD (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.11–2.87, p=0.02).
