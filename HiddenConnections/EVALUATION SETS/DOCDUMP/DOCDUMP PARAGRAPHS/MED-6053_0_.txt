Abstract OBJECTIVES: Reticuloendotheliosis viruses (REV) are a group of retroviruses like avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses (ALSV) that naturally infect and cause cancers in chickens. We recently found that ALSV antibody levels were associated with job tasks in the poultry industry. The objectives of this study are to examine whether a similar association can be found with REV antibody levels and to examine the correlation between REV and ALSV antibody levels.
