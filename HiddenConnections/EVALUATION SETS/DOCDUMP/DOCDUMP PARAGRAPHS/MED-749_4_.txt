RESULTS: At baseline, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were lower in patients drinking 3-5 (Group B) than 0-2 cups/day (Group A) (56 ± 6 vs 74 ± 11/60 ± 3 vs 73 ± 7 U/L p=0.05/p=0.04, respectively). HCV-RNA levels were significantly higher in Group B [(6.2 ± 1.5) × 10(5)vs (3.9 ± 1.0) × 10(5)UI/mL, p=0.05]. During coffee intake, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and collagen levels were significantly lower than during abstinence (15 ± 3 vs 44 ± 16 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine/10(5)deoxyguanosine, p=0.05 and 56 ± 9 vs 86 ± 21 ng/mL, p=0.04).
