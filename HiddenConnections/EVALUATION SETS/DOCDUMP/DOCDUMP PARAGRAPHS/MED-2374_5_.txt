Results Mean resting HR was significantly higher among SCD cases compared to controls (7.5bpm difference, p<0.0001). Heart rate was a significant determinant of SCD after adjustment for significant co-morbidities and medications [OR for 10 bpm increase = 1.26; 95% CI (1.14 – 1.38); p<0.0001]. After considering LVSD, resting HR was slightly attenuated but remained significantly associated with SCD (p=0.005).
