Rat fetal testis xenografts were exposed for 4 d to DBP as a positive control. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Testosterone production was assessed by measuring host serum testosterone and seminal vesicle (SV) weights at termination, plus testis gene expression (rats). RESULTS: Human fetal testis xenografts showed similar survival (âˆ¼80%) and total graft weight (8.6 vs. 10.1 mg) in vehicle and DBP-exposed hosts, respectively.
