Abstract Contractile motility of the gallbladder and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) responses to egg yolk administration were studied in 28 diabetic patients and 12 normal subjects. The patients were divided into three groups: group A (n = 10) had no diabetic neuropathy, group B (n = 8) had diabetic neuropathy with little autonomic neuropathy, and group C (n = 10) had advanced diabetic autonomic neuropathy. In groups A and B, contraction of the gallbladder after egg yolk administration was not significantly different from that of normal subjects.
