AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study we investigated the ability of urinary ITC excretion to reflect a low or high daily intake of cruciferous vegetables. METHODS: The design was a controlled human crossover study (n = 6). Subjects consumed a self-restricted glucosinolate-free diet 48 h before the study-day where a basic diet supplemented with 80 or 350 g of mixed cruciferous vegetables was consumed.
