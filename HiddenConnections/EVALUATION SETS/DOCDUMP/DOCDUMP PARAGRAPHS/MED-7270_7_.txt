The higher intake of antioxidants led to increased 48 h stool output (324 (SD 38) g in HT v. 218 (SD 22) g in LT), and to higher TAC and total phenolic concentrations in faecal water. No significant variation in the other measured parameters was observed between the diets. In conclusion, a diet selected to raise the intake of dietary antioxidants is able to increase stool bulk and antioxidant content of faeces.
