Univariate analysis demonstrated that the median FMD significantly predicted CV events (odds ratio 2.78, 95% CI 1.35 to 5.71, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis, controlling for traditional CV risk factors, demonstrated that median FMD was the best independent predictor of long-term CV adverse events (odds ratio 2.93, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.68, p <0.001). In conclusion, brachial artery median FMD independently predicts long-term adverse CV events in healthy subjects with no apparent heart disease in addition to those derived from traditional risk factor assessment.
