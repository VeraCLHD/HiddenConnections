Subjects in the second and third tertiles of nut consumption had a 51% and 32% reduced risk of inflammatory disease mortality, respectively, compared with those in the first tertile (reference). Dietary intakes of long-chain n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and fish were not associated with inflammatory disease mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We report on a novel link between dietary intake of total n-3 PUFA and risk of inflammatory disease mortality in older women.
