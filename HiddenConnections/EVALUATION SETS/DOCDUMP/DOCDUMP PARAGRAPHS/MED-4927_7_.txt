Total tremor score (range = 0 – 36) was a clinical measure of tremor severity. Results The total tremor score ranged from 0 – 36, indicating that a full spectrum of tremor severities was captured in our sample. Blood harmane concentration correlated with total tremor score (p = 0.007), as did blood lead concentration (p = 0.045).
