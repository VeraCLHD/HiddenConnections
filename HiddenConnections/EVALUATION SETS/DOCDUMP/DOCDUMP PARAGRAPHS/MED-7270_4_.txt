In the faecal samples obtained from a subset of nine subjects, moisture, pH, ammonia content, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium counts, faecal water antioxidants and genotoxicity were measured. A 3 d weighed food record was used to assess the diet composition during HT and LT diet intake. Significant increases in the intake of TAC, vitamins E and C and phenolic compounds were observed during the HT diet intake.
