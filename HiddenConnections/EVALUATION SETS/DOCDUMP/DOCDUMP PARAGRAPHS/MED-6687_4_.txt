RESULTS: Adjusted for age, childhood hunger, life-course socioeconomic position and current lifestyle childhood almost daily meat eating compared with less than weekly meat eating was associated with higher WHR (0.007, 95% CI 0.0003 to 0.01) in men but not women. No association with fasting glucose was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential limitations of this study, especially the crude nature of the exposure and modest findings, the results should be considered as preliminary.
