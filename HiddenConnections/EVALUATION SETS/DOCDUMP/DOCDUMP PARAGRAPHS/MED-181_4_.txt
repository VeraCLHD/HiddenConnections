The mean DNA damage, expressed as the ratio of tail intensity (fluorescence in the tail) to total intensity of the comet after incubation with faecal water from volunteers consuming diet 1 was about twice as high as for diet 2. The susceptibility of the cells incubated with faecal water to DNA damage caused by additional hydrogen peroxide treatment showed no significant differences between the two diets. Generation of oxidized pyrimidine and purine bases revealed no differences after pretreatment with both types of faecal water.
