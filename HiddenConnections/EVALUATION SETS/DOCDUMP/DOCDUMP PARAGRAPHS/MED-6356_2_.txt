The authors highlight an important policy document issued jointly by the National Cancer Institute and the Society for Pediatric Radiology--specifically, its conclusion that a small dose from CT represents "a public health concern." Finally, the article identifies several contentious issues and proposes policy initiatives that, if implemented, could result in significant reductions of future radiogenic cancers and chronic injuries. The authors call for discussions between professional radiology societies and public interest health organizations, thereby involving all stakeholders.
