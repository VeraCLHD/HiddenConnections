In the present study, we sought to determine the longitudinal course of alpha-Gal specific AB titers of all isotypes over 8 weeks among healthy adult subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients display increased anti-Gal titers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We drew serum from healthy probands (n=20) weekly for 8 weeks and obtained plasma samples of from patients suffering from Crohn's disease (n=20) and ulcerative colitis (n=20).
