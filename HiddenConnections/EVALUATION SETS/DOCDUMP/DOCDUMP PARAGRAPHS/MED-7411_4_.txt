Methods: We used multiple regression analyses to model the relationships between sperm parameters and two alternative measures of AGD [from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (AGDAS) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (AGDAP)] in 126 volunteers in Rochester, New York. Results: AGDAS, but not AGDAP, was associated with sperm concentration, motility, morphology, total sperm count, and total motile count (p-values, 0.002–0.048). Men with AGDAS below (vs. above) the median were 7.3 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 2.5–21.6) to have a low sperm concentration (< 20 × 106/mL).
