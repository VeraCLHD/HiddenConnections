METHODS: We evaluated the effect of handgrip (HG) and arm-tensing in 19 patients affected by tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. The study consisted of an acute single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over tilt-table efficacy study and a clinical follow-up feasibility study. RESULTS: In the acute tilt study, HG was administered for 2 min, starting at the time of onset of symptoms of impending syncope.
