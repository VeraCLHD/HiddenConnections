At four months, while diets differed significantly, the 24-hour output of calcium and oxalate did not differ significantly within and between groups after adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, and personal and family history of calcium stones) and baseline values. However, as many as 12 out of 31 ICSFs (95% CI, 22 to 58%) assigned to a low animal protein diet achieved a reduction in the urine urea excretion rate of more than 50 mmol/day and also exhibited a significant decrease in urinary calcium excretion that averaged 1.8 mmol/day. A significant correlation between urea and calcium outputs was observed only among patients with hypercalciuria.
