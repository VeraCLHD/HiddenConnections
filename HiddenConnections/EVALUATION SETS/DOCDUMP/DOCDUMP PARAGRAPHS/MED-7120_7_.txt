All benchmark dose results were similar to those obtained for dose-response relationships at age 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of prolonged I-III interpeak intervals indicates that some neurotoxic effects from intrauterine MeHg exposure are irreversible. A change in vulnerability to MeHg toxicity is suggested by the apparent sensitivity of the peak III-V component to recent MeHg exposure.
