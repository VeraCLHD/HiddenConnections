A high urinary uric acid excretion, a low urine volume and an acidic urinary pH value are suggested to be the most important risk factors for uric acid stone formation. AIM OF THE STUDY: The effect of a vegetarian diet and different omnivorous diets on the risk of uric acid crystallization was investigated. METHODS: Ten healthy male subjects ingested a self-selected meat-containing diet (SD) for two weeks, and three different standardized diets for a period of 5 days each.
