We performed a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to provide updated information on how coffee drinking affects HCC risk. METHODS: We performed a PubMed/MEDLINE search of the original articles published in English from 1966 through September 2012, on case-control or cohort studies that associated coffee consumption with liver cancer or HCC. We calculated the summary relative risk (RR) for any, low, and high consumption of coffee vs no consumption.
