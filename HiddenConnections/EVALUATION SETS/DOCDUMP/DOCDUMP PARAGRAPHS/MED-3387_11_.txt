The gastric emptying latency phase, lag, and half time were significantly shorter for the small particles. Ingesting small particles causes faster gastric emptying and produces greater glycemic and IRs. Between-individual variations in GR and IR can be observed even when all the food associated factors including ingested particle size (mastication) are controlled for in humans.
