This study was carried out to evaluate the antioxidant activity in the faeces of a group of healthy subjects on a freely-selected diet, and to look for possible associations with the intake of some macro- and micronutrients and food groups. Fourteen subjects recorded their food intake three times for a period of 2 d, each time collecting all the faeces passed during the next 24 h. Total antioxidant activity (TAA; mmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8 tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox)/kg) of faecal suspensions was measured using the 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS(. +)) decolorisation assay.
