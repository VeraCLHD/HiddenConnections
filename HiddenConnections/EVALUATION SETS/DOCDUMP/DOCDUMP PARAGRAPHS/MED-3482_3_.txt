OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acute effect of the ingestion of large amounts of olive, soybean and palm oils, fresh and at two different deep-fry levels, on the glucose and lipid profiles and the endothelial function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten healthy young volunteers were included in the study. After performing a baseline evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors and drawing a fasting blood sample, subjects were exposed to a randomly assigned potato soup meal containing 60 mL of one of three different vegetable oils (olive, soybean and palm), either fresh or at one of two different deep-fry levels (10 and 20 fries, respectively).
