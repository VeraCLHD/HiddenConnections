CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old man with chronic constipation presented with restricted diet, compulsions on evacuation, social isolation and depressed mood, thus satisfying the diagnosis of BOS. Cognitive behavioral therapy led to complete remission of symptoms, and results were maintained after 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Although BOS is not frequently diagnosed, it is probably more prevalent than thought.
