Spline curves supported a linear association of sodium with cardiovascular events, continuing to descend from 3600 to 2300 and 1500 mg/24hr, although the data were sparse at the lowest levels. Controlling for creatinine levels had little effect on these results. Conclusions Results from the TOHP studies, which overcome the major methodological challenges of prior studies, are consistent with overall health benefits of reducing sodium intake to the 1500 to 2300 mg/day range in the majority of the population, in agreement with current dietary guidelines.
