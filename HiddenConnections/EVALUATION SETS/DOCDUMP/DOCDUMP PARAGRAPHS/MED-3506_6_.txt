There were no significant differences in blood pressure changes between groups. In the higher-dose group, a slight increase in body weight was noted (0.8 kg, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 1.6). CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dark chocolate may be associated with a reduction in blood pressure (BP).
