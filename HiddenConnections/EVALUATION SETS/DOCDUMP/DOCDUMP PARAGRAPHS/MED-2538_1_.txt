Fetal exposure to certain phthalates [e.g. di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP)] causes masculinization disorders in rats, raising concern for similar effects in humans. We investigated whether DBP exposure impairs steroidogenesis by the human fetal testis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine effects of DBP exposure on testosterone production by normally growing human fetal testis xenografts.
