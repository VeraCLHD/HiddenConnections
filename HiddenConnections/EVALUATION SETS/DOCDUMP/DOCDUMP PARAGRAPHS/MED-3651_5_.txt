Neural pathways through both parasympathetic and sympathetic systems could be responsible. The exact nature of the change in colonic motility that is produced is unknown. It could involve changes in the pacemakers for colonic contractions (the electrical slow waves of the colon and the migrating spike burst of the colon), changes in the excitability of the colonic musculature or changes in colonic mucosal function.
