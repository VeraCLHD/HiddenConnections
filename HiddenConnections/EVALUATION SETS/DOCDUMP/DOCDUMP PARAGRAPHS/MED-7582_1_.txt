Its presence is ubiquitous worldwide in swine populations. Zoonotic transmission of swine HEV to non human primates has been achieved experimentally and transmission of HEV after ingestion of contaminated raw or undercooked meat is well documented. In Canada, so far, no HEV outbreak has been documented but HEV genotype 3 strains have been identified in sera and faecal samples of swine origin.
