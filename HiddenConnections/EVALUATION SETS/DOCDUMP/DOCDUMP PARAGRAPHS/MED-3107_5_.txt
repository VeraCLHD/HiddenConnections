On the basis of 4 clinical trials with separate results for hip fracture (6,504 subjects with 139 hip fractures), the pooled RR between calcium and placebo was 1.64 (95% CI:1.02, 2.64). Sensitivity analyses including 2 additional small trials with <100 participants or per-protocol results did not substantially alter results. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled results from prospective cohort studies suggest that calcium intake is not significantly associated with hip fracture risk in women or men.
