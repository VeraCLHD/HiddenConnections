When comparing between the two HF meals, the change in endothelium-dependent dilation was not significant (7.7 vs. 8.6%, P = 0.678). GTN-induced dilation was not significantly different before and after the LF, WHF or LHF (0.1 +/- 0.5% vs. 0.2 +/- 0.9% vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5%, P = 0.094). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in a local population, impairment of endothelial function is a possible mechanism in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis from HF intake, beyond just affecting lipid levels.
