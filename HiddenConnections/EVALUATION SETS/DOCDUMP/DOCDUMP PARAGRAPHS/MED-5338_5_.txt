RESULTS: Subjects in group 1 demonstrated a statistical increase in TC (P < or = 0.001) during the study. Patients in groups 2 (P < or = 0.001) and 3 (P < or = 0.05) demonstrated statistical improvement in TC reduction during dietary counseling. The effect on TC was blunted in group 3 after dietary counseling was discontinued.
