All the meals resulted in a similar acute endothelial impairment (FMD decrease of 32.1%, confidence interval [CI] 95%, 28.0-36.2) and postprandial increase in triglycerides (27.03%, CI 95%, 20.5-33.3), independently of the type of oil ingested (p=0.44) and regardless of its deep-fry level (p=0.62). No correlation was found between endothelial impairment and postprandial triglyceride increment (r=-0.22, p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found in the acute adverse effect of the ingestion of different vegetable oils on the endothelial function.
