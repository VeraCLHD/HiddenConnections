Testing of different samples prepared by the same Chamorro woman over 2 years suggests that the washing procedure probably varies in thoroughness from preparation to preparation but is routinely efficient in removing at least 85% of the total BMAA from all batches. Analysis of a flour sample that had undergone only 24 hours of soaking indicated that this single wash removed 90% of the total BMAA. We conclude that processed cycad flour as prepared by the Chamorros of Guam and Rota contains extremely low levels of BMAA, which are in the order of only 0.005% by weight (mean values for all samples).
