RESULTS: Seven cohort studies and 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56-1.12; p = 0.19) for RCTs and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.59-1.16; p = 0.27) for cohort studies. On sensitivity analysis, no statistically significant difference was noted when stratified by study design or quality of the studies (as graded by Jadad or USPSTF scoring systems).
