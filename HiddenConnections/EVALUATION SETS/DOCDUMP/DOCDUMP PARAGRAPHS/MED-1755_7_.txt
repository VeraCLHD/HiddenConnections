Conclusions. SEP from across the life course is associated with HRT use. Because the association between early life SEP and HRT is not fully explained by adult risk factors, residual confounding (which is not captured by adjustment for adult variables only) may explain some of the disparity between observational studies and randomized controlled trials in this area.
