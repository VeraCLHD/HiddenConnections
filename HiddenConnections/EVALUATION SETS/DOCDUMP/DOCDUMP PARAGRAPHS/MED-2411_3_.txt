In healthy volunteers, approximately 3h following ingestion of a dietary nitrate load (beetroot juice 500ml) BP was substantially reduced (Î”max - 10.4/8 mmHg); an effect that correlated with peak increases in plasma nitrite concentration. The dietary nitrate load also prevented endothelial dysfunction induced by an acute ischemic insult in the human forearm and significantly attenuated ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to collagen and ADP. Interruption of the enterosalivary conversion of nitrate to nitrite (facilitated by bacterial anaerobes situated on the surface of the tongue), prevented the rise in plasma nitrite, blocked the decrease in BP and abolished the inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation, confirming that these vasoprotective effects were due to the activity of nitrite converted from the ingested nitrate.
