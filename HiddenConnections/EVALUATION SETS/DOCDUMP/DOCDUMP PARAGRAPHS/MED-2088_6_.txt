Plasma ANP, AVP and ET-1 were not different between meals. AI was significantly increased following the high sodium meal (p = 0.02) but there was no effect on BP. CONCLUSIONS: A meal containing 65 mmol Na increases serum sodium and arterial stiffness but does not alter postprandial nitrate/nitrite concentration in healthy normotensive individuals.
