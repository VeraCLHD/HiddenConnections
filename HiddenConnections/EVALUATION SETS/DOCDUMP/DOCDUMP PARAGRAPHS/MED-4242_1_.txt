The diverse array of bioactive nutrients present in these natural products plays a pivotal role in prevention and cure of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and other neuronal dysfunctions. Accumulated evidence suggests that naturally occurring phyto-compounds, such as polyphenolic antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, herbs and nuts, may potentially hinder neurodegeneration, and improve memory and cognitive function. Nuts such as walnut have also demonstrated neuroprotective effect against AD.
