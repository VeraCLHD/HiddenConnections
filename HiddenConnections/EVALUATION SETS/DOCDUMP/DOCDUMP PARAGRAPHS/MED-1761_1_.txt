METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of prospective cohort studies assessing the association of serum 25(OH)D levels with survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients. Study characteristics and results were extracted and dose-response relationships were graphically displayed in a standardised manner. Meta-analyses using random effects models were performed to estimate pooled hazard ratios.
