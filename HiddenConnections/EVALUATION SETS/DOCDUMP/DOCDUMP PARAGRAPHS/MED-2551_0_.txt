Abstract OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that cigarette smoking protects against the development of PD. BACKGROUND: Smoking has been inversely associated with PD in many studies, but whether this reflects a biologic effect on the underlying disease process or merely confounding or selection bias remains uncertain. METHODS: The authors compared smoking histories in male twin pairs identified from the National Academy of Sciences--National Research Council World War II Veteran Twins Cohort.
