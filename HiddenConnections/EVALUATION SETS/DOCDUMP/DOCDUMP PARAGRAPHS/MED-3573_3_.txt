Eight combinations of 4 water challenges (4.8, 9.3, 11.0, or 14 mL·kg(-1)) and 2 hydration states (mildly hypohydrated (HY), -2.0%; euhydrated (EU), -0.2% body mass) were employed. First, thirst was linearly related to body water loss, and ratings of thirst distinguished HY from EU (p < 0.001) subsequent to 19 h of controlled food and fluid intake. Second, measurements of urine volume 60 min after consuming a water bolus (11.0 or 14 mL·kg(-1)) were strongly and inversely correlated with entering hydration state, assessed by urine specific gravity (r(2) = 0.76, p < 0.0001) and urine osmolality (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.0001).
