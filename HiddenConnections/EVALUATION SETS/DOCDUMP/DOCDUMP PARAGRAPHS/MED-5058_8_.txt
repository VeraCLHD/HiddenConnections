Of the 13.5-year difference in life expectancy in males, the differential mortality from diseases of the digestive system (mainly due to cirrhosis of the liver), accidents (from both motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle accidents), and infectious and parasitic disease contributed half (50%) of the gap in life expectancy. In females, the above primarily preventable causes of deaths accounted for 41% of the life expectancy gap. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, we suggest that future focus should be in the area of primary prevention in order to reduce the incidence of infectious and parasitic diseases, liver cirrhosis, and accidents.
