OBJECTIVE: To explain the actions of these food factors on the AhR transformation, as the mechanisms underlying are not fully understood. METHODS: This review introduces recent articles that have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms by which food factors regulate the AhR transformation and downstream drug-metabolizing enzymes. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The role of classical ligands including dioxins as agonists of the receptor is well documented.
