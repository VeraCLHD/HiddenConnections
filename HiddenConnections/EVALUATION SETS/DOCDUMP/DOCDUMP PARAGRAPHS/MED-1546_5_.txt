Six samples of both plaque and saliva were collected from each subject at roughly one-monthly intervals. Total bacteria, total streptococci, S. mutans and lactobacilli counts were determined by culture in both saliva and dental plaque. The highest bacterial titres were recorded for the control population, while each drinking habit subgroup showed counts roughly one log lower than the controls.
