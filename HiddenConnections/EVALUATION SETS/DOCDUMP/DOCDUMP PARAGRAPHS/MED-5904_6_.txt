Ranking participants by age-adjusted VO(2max) revealed that the highest tertile had 17% more na√Øve CD8+ T-cells and 57% and 37% less senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, respectively, compared to the lowest tertile. VO(2max) was not associated with latent cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection, indicating that the moderating associations of VO(2max) were not confounded by persistent viral infections. This is the first study to show that aerobic fitness is associated with a lower age-related accumulation of senescent T-cells, highlighting the beneficial effects of maintaining a physically active lifestyle on the aging immune system.
