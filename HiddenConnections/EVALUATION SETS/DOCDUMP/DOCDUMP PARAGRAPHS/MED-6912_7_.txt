The daily intakes of PFOS and PFOA from the consumption of meat, meat products, and eggs, and from dust ingestion, as calculated from our samples in this study, were compared with estimated daily intake of PFCs reported from the concentrations in drinking water, fish and seafood from China. Our calculations indicate that dietary sources (EDI(dietary)) account for the overwhelming proportion of (>99% for PFOS and 98% for PFOA) total daily intake (TDI) in adults. The analyzed foodstuffs (meat, meat products, and eggs) were not the major contributors to dietary exposure to PFOS, whereas, meat was the primary contributor to dietary exposure to PFOA.
