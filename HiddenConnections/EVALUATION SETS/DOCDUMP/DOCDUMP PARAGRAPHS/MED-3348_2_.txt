Baseline pH and titratable acidity were measured by titrating each fruit smoothie with 0.5 mL increments of 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and measuring the pH following the addition of each increment, until pH 7 and pH 10 were reached. Each of the fruit smoothies investigated demonstrated a low baseline pH and had relatively high titratable acidity. Owing to both their low pH and high titratable acidity, it would be advisable to limit the consumption of such fruit smoothies to meal times.
