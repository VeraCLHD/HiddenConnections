Crystal content using SEM was scored from 0 to +3. SEM using vacuum dehydration had significantly higher crystal content compared with SEM using ethanol dehydration (+2.5 +/- 0.53 vs +0.25 +/- 0.46; p <0.0003), with enhanced detection of CC perforations. The presence of CCs using SEM and confocal microscopy was similar, suggesting that CC perforation can occur in vivo at 37 degrees C. All patients with acute coronary syndrome had perforating CCs, but none was present in patients without acute coronary syndrome (p = 0.0001).
