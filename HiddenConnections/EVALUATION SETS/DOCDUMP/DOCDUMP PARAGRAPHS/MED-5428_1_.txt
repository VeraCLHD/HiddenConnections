This corresponds to 6 micrograms/ml of dissolved 'solids' as determined by fully drying the aqueous flavouring in a vacuum desiccator. In AHH-1 human lymphoblasts, which contain a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system, mutations were induced at 0.3 microliter/ml, corresponding to 18 microliters/ml of dissolved 'solids'. The flavouring did not induce 8-azaguanine resistant mutations in Salmonella typhimurium at concentrations up to 1.5 microliter/ml.
