Endothelial function of 6 unmedicated humans with hypercholesterolemia was maintained after consumption of English walnuts with a meal high in high saturated fats; however, consumption of black walnuts with the same meal did not maintain endothelial function. Overall, these results support the recommendation that consumption of 1 oz of English walnuts per day may decrease cardiovascular risk, but more research on black walnut consumption is necessary before an appropriate recommendation can be made.
