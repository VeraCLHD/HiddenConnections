Smoker patients were then classified as mild (>or=1 and <or=10 cigarettes/d), moderate (>10 and <20 cigarettes/day), or heavy smokers (>or=20 cigarettes/d). Sperm concentration and FI were significantly (P < .05) different among the 3 considered smoker classes. Comparing the pairs of smoker classes, sperm concentration and FI in heavy smokers were significantly lower (P < .05) than that observed in mild smoker and nonsmoker groups.
