RESULTS: A negative correlation was observed between the changes of glucose and FMD (r = 0.416, P = 0.0018) 2 h after ingestion of saccharose. At 3 h, neither blood glucose nor FMD were different from baseline. Changes of both blood glucose (P = 0.0007) and FMD (P = 0.046) were significantly lower after administration of acarbose.
