Median sodium excretion was 3630 mg/24hr, with 1.4% of the participants having intake <1500 mg/24hr and 10% <2300 mg/24hr, consistent with national levels. Compared to those with sodium excretion of 3600 to <4800 mg/24hr, risk for those with sodium <2300 mg/24hr was 32% lower after multivariable adjustment (HR=0.68, 95%CI = 0.34â€“1.37, p for trend = 0.13). There was a linear 17% increase in risk per 1000 mg/24hr (p=0.05).
