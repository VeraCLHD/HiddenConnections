Overall bacterial diversity was different across nonconsumers and consumers of aspartame (P < .01) and acesulfame-K (P = .03). Mean predicted gene abundance did not differ across consumers and nonconsumers of aspartame or acesulfame-K. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial abundance profiles and predicted gene function were not associated with recent dietary high-intensity sweetener consumption.
