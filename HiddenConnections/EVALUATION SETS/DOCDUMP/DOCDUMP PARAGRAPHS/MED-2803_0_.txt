Abstract BACKGROUND: Fruit and vegetable (FV) intake, which is often low in older people, is associated with reduced chronic disease risk. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether increased FV intake improves measures of immune function. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (The Ageing and Dietary Intervention Trial) in 83 healthy volunteers aged 65-85 y with low FV intakes (â‰¤2 portions/d); 82 subjects completed the intervention.
