AJC prevented the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) normally induced by Abeta treatment under these conditions. AJC also prevented Abeta-induced calcium influx and apoptosis, each of which results in part due to increased ROS. These findings suggest that the antioxidant potential of apple products can prevent Abeta-induced oxidative damage.
