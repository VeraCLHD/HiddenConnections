Colonic crypt cell proliferation rates were dramatically higher in AAs (21.8 +/- 1.1% vs. 3.2 +/- 0.8% labeling, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, the higher CRC risk and mucosal proliferation rates in AAs than in NAs were associated with higher dietary intakes of animal products and higher colonic populations of potentially toxic hydrogen and secondary bile-salt-producing bacteria. This supports our hypothesis that CRC risk is determined by interactions between the external (dietary) and internal (bacterial) environments.
