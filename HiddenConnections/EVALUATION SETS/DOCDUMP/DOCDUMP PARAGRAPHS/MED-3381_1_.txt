We sought to test this idea by manipulating chewing instructions whilst using electromyography to monitor chewing behaviour. Comparing 35 with 10 chews per mouthful, we showed that higher chewing counts reduced food intake despite increasing chewing speed, and despite doubling meal duration for achieving a subjective reference point for feeling 'comfortably full'. Although limited by a low sample size, our preliminary findings confirm Mr. Fletcher's doctrine, and provide a basis for further research in this area.
