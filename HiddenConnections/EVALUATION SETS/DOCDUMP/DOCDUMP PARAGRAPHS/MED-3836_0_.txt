Abstract BACKGROUND: We aimed to clarify the lifestyle factors associated with erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) in a Japanese population. METHODS: Among 886 subjects who underwent health screening, we selected, according to their scores on the FSSG (frequency scale for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease; GERD) questionnaire and the findings of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, 138 subjects with erosive esophagitis (EE), 148 subjects with NERD (absence of esophagitis, FSSG score ≥8, and acid reflux-related symptoms score ≥4), and 565 control subjects (absence of esophagitis and FSSG score ≤7). We compared clinical characteristics and various lifestyle factors in these three groups.
