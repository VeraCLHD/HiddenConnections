However, qualitatively, DRW may reduce arterial exposure to apoB48-containing lipoproteins over the 6-h postprandial period measured. DRW consumption did not significantly change postprandial TG or insulin levels. A 35% (p = 0.02) increase in postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels and a 54% (p = 0.02) increase in insulin levels were observed following RW consumption, compared to water.
