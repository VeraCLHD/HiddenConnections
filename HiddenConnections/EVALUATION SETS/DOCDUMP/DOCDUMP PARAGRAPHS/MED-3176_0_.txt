Abstract Renal and hormonal responses were studied in a group of healthy individuals fed, in random order, for three weeks, a vegetable protein diet (N = 10), an animal protein diet (N = 10), or an animal protein diet supplemented with fiber (N = 7), all containing the same amount of total protein (chronic study). In seven additional subjects the acute renal, metabolic and hormonal response to ingestion of a meat or soya load of equivalent total protein content was investigated (acute study). In the chronic study GRF, RPF and fractional clearance of albumin and IgG were significantly higher on the animal than the vegetable protein diets (GFR: 121 +/- 4 vs. 111 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.001; RPF: 634 +/- 29 vs. 559 +/- 26 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.001; theta alb: 19.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 10.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(-7), P less than 0.01; theta IgG: 11.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 x 10(-7), P less than 0.05).
