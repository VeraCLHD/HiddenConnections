This study investigated the possibility of using heme iron in the form of blood-based crisp bread as a diet-based treatment program to improve the iron status of women of reproductive age. METHODS: In a 12-wk intervention study, 77 women (mean age 24 y) were assigned to one of four groups: blood-based crisp bread (35 mg of iron [Fe], 27 mg of which was heme Fe), iron supplementation consisting of 35 mg of non-heme iron/day (Fe35), iron supplementation consisting of 60 mg of non-heme iron/day (Fe60), and controls (iron-free tablets). RESULTS: Body iron increased significantly in the crisp bread group by a median of 2.7 mg/kg (interquartile range 3.1, n = 18), in the Fe35 group by 2.7 mg/kg (interquartile range 2.8, n = 11), and in the Fe60 group by 4.1 mg/kg (interquartile range 3.6, n = 13), whereas no change was observed in the control group.
