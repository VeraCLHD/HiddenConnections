Abstract Prenatal closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA) is associated with maternal ingestion of cyclooxygenase inhibitors during pregnancy. We report a case of prenatal DA closure after maternal ingestion of MonaVie, a juice blend containing the cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. A G(2)P(0)Ab(1) woman had an uncomplicated first and second trimester and normal 20-week fetal ultrasound.
