Endothelial function was evaluated by ultrasound measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Coffee consumption was evaluated based on a food frequency questionnaire and was categorized as 'low' (< 200 ml/day), 'moderate' (200-450 ml/day), or 'high' (> 450 ml/day). RESULTS: From the subjects included in the study, 87% consumed a boiled Greek type of coffee.
