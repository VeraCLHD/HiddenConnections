There was no reduction in surface hardness in the case of the teeth immersed in the thickie. Omission of certain ingredients from the homemade smoothie affected the magnitude of surface hardness reductions seen. With regard to the loss of surface contour of the tooth samples following immersion in the drinks, as assessed by depth loss, there were significant differences between the drinks (p = 0.0064) with the thickie and negative control not causing depth loss and the kiwi, apple and lime smoothie producing most depth loss (28.26 (5.45) Î¼m).
