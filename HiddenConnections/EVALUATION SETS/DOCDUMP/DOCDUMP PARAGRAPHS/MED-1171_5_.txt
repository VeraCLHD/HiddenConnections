Almost 90% (26/29) of the animal and meat isolates were isolated from chicken carcasses or retail chicken meat. We screened NARMS isolates for the presence of blaCMY, determined whether the gene was plasmid-encoded, examined pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns to assess the genetic diversities of the isolates, and categorized the blaCMY plasmids by plasmid incompatibility groups and plasmid multi-locus sequence typing. All 47 blaCMY genes were found to be plasmid encoded.
