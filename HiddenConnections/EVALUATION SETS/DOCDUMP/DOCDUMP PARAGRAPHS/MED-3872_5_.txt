Intralesional T-cell clones presenting identical TCR-BVBJ AVAJ and -CDR3 sequences were able to recognize several antigens with little or low homology, showing an intramolecular degenerate pattern of antigen recognition. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of rheumatic fever (RF) patients produced proinflammatory cytokines, and intralesional mononuclear cells from severe RHD patients produced predominantly Th1-type cytokines. These results illustrate the complex mechanisms leading to heart tissue damage in RF/RHD patients.
