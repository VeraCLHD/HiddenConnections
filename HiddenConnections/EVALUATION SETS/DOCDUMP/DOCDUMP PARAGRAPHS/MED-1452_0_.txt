Abstract The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCG) assay (comet assay) is a sensitive technique for detecting the presence of DNA strand-breaks and alkali-labile damage in individual cells. This technique was used to study peripheral blood cells from three volunteers after physical activity. The test subjects had to run on a treadmill and were checked for blood pressure and ECG, lactate concentration and creatine kinase activity.
