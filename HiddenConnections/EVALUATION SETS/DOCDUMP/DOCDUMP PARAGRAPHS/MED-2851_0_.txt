Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Moreover, rates of CVD mortality are two to four times higher in diabetes than in those without diabetes. It was conventional thinking that achieving near-normoglycemia would help reduce CVD risk and overall mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
