The present results showed that over 4 years, participants in the highest quartile of change in white bread intake gained 0路76 kg more than those in the lowest quartile (P for trend = 0路003) and 1路28 cm more than those in the lowest quartile (P for trend < 0路001). No significant dose-response relationships were observed for change in whole-bread consumption and anthropometric measures. Gaining weight (>2 kg) and gaining waist circumference (>2 cm) during follow-up was not associated with increase in bread consumption, but participants in the highest quartile of changes in white bread intake had a reduction of 33 % in the odds of losing weight (>2 kg) and a reduction of 36 % in the odds of losing waist circumference (>2 cm).
