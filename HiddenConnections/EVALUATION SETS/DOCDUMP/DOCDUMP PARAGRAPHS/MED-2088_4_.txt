There were significant increases in serum sodium, osmolality and chloride in response to the high sodium meal. However plasma nitrate/nitrite concentrations were not different between meals (meal p = 0.812; time p = 0.45; meal Ã— time interaction p = 0.50). Plasma ANP, AVP and ET-1 were not different between meals.
