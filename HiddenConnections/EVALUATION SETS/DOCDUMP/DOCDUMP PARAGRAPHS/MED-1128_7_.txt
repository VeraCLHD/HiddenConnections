The number of deaths and the sample size of each study arm were extracted independently by 2 researchers. Twenty-one articles were included in the analysis, which generated a total pooled sample of 91,074 people and 8794 deaths. These trials were pooled in a meta-analysis, and the outcomes were expressed as RRs and 95% CIs.
