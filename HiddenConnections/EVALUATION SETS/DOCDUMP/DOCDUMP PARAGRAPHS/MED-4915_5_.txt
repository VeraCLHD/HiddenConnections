Univariate analysis revealed that caffeine consumption in ET patients was higher than control group (median and 90th percentile range: 2300 (0, 9000) mg-years versus 1500 (0, 6090) mg-years, p=0.01). However, the multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that caffeine was no longer a significant factor associated with ET (p=0.119). There was no significant correlation between amount of caffeine intake and disease duration (Spearman's r=0.194; p=0.202) or total tremor score (Spearman's r=0.045; p=0.771) in ET patients.
