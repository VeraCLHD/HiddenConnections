The ORs for a difference in IGF1 concentration between the highest and lowest fifth were 1·38 (95% CI 1·14–1·68) for oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours and 0·80 (0·57–1·13) for oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours (p for heterogeneity=0·007). Interpretation Circulating IGF1 is positively associated with breast-cancer risk. The association is not substantially modified by IGFBP3, and does not differ markedly by menopausal status, but seems to be confined to oestrogen-receptor-positive tumours.
