The clonality of the urine and fecal isolates of E. coli from the cystitis subjects was further evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: E. coli strains causing cystitis dominated the rectal flora of 7 of 9 patients. In the remaining 2 patients, similar clones comprised at least 20% of the fecal flora.
