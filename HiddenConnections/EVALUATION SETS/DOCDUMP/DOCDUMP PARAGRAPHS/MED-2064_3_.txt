Another racemic C4'-OH hapten (CH2COOH) was prepared starting from naringenin. The haptens elicited variable antibody titers dependent on linker lengths, with short linkers giving the best results. Three antisera were characterized in detail: anti-C7-carboxy-propyloxy-2S-(-)-8-PN (anti-H-11), anti-C7-carboxy-propyloxy-2R-(+)-8-PN (anti-H-10), and anti-C4'-carboxy-methoxy-rac-8-PN (anti-H-25).
