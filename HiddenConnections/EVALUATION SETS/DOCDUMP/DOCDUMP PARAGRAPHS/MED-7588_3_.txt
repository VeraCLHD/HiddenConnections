Compared with those for never smokers, hazard ratios were 1.29 (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.75), 1.79 (95% confidence interval: 1.32, 2.42), 2.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.63, 3.57), and 2.29 (85% confidence interval: 1.38, 3.79) for former smokers who smoked ≤1 or >1 pack/day and for current smokers who smoked ≤1 or >1 pack/day, respectively. Higher meat intake was associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (hazard ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 2.07 for the fifth vs. first quintile; P for trend = 0.06); however, there were no clear effects of meat-cooking method or doneness level. Individuals who did not drink coffee appeared to have a higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia than those who drank various quantities of coffee.
