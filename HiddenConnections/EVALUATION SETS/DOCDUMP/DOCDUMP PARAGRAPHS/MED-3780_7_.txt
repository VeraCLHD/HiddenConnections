The incidence rates of total stroke per 10 000 person-years were 72.6 in the lowest quintile and 84.4 in the highest. The association was confined to men with body mass index <25 kg/m(2), the hazard ratios were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17-1.68; P trend<0.001) for total stroke and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.13-1.70; P trend=0.001) for cerebral infarction; no association was observed among overweight and obese men.
