Abstract OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of fish oil supplementation on lipid levels and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Lilacs, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry bibliographies of relevant papers, and expert input updated through September 1998 was undertaken. All randomized placebo-controlled trials were included in which fish oil supplementation was the only intervention in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
