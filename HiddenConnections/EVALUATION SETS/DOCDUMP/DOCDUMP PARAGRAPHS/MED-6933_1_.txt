Screening dietary compounds for chemopreventive activity however, requires a systematic and wide-ranging approach to encompass the complexity of carcinogenesis. We present some of the molecular pathways that underpin the broad biological processes involved in carcinogenesis. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and the evasion of apoptosis are important biological mechanisms by which carcinogenesis occurs.
