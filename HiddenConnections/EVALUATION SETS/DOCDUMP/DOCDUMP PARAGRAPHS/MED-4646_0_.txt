Abstract Overweight and obesity are major contributors to both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moreover, individuals with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese are at particularly high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. Although short-term weight loss has been shown to ameliorate obesity-related metabolic abnormalities and CVD risk factors, the long-term consequences of intentional weight loss in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes have not been adequately examined.
