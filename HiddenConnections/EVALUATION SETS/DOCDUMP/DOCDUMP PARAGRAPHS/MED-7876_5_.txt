In the 0.46 E% LC n-3 PUFAs scenario, 5, 50 and 95th percentile are exposed to 2.74, 5.52 and 9.98 pg TEQ/kgbw/day, respectively. Therefore, if the recommended LC n-3 PUFAs intake would be based on fish consumption as the only extra source, the majority of the study population would exceed the proposed health based guidance values for dioxins and dioxin-like substances.
