GFR in diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria after ingestion of each protein was similar to the response in normal subjects. In diabetic patients with microalbuminuria, GFR did not significantly increase after ingestion of each protein. In diabetes with macroalbuminuria, GFR decreased after ingestion of tuna fish meal and did not significantly change after intake of bean curd.
