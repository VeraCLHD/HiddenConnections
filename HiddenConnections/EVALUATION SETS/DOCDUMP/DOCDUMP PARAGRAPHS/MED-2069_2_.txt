These physical signs of exposure to active estrogen occur in the presence of normal or only minimally elevated levels of endogenous steroid estrogens. Because levels of circulating steroid hormones failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the feminization observed, alternate explanations were considered. If the estrogenization observed was not entirely a function of tissue expose to steroid estrogens produced endogenously, then perhaps tissues were being exposed to exogenous estrogenic substances from dietary sources.
