Six of the 9 IDM elements occurred in < or =20% of the visits with none addressed in > or =50%. CRC screening occurred less frequently for those discussing "pros and cons" (12% vs. 46%, P = 0.01) and "patient preferences" (6% vs. 47%, P = 0.001) compared with those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: We found that a lack of informed decision-making occurred during CRC screening discussions and that particular elements of the process were negatively associated with screening.
