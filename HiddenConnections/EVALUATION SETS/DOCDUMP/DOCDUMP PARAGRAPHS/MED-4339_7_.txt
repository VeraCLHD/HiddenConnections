Semi-vegetarians included women who reported <30 g/day of red meat, poultry, and fish and pescatarians who consumed <20 g/day of meat/poultry but >10 g/day of fish. All other women were classified as non-vegetarians. We applied mixed models to compute least-square means by vegetarian status adjusted for potential confounders.
