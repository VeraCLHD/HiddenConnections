Homogeneity was evaluated through a DerSimonian-Laird test. RESULTS: Higher serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were associated with lower mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. Patients in the highest quintile of 25(OH)D had 37% lower mortality from colorectal cancer compared to those in the lowest quintile of 25(OH)D (pooled odds ratio=0.63, p<0.0001).
