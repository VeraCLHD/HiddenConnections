OBJECTIVE To compare the rates of ESRD, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death and examine risk factors for ESRD and all-cause mortality in Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants. Design The CHS is a longitudinal cohort study of community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older. PARTICIPANTS 1,268 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were followed until the time of first event (ESRD, cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular death) or until March 31, 2003.
