Twenty healthy men followed three 4-week diets in a randomised cross-over design: a Western diet, rich in saturated fat (22% SFA, 12% MUFA and 0.4% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), all fractions are % of energy); a Mediterranean diet, rich in MUFA ( < 10 % SFA, 24 % MUFA and 0.4% ALA); a low-fat diet enriched in ALA ( < 10% SFA, 12% MUFA and 2% ALA). At the end of each dietary period all subjects underwent a postprandial study. Plasma concentrations of lipid parameters, soluble intercellular cell-adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), nitrates and nitrites (NOx) and endothelial function studied by laser Doppler were examined at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h.
