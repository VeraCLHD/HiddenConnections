Groups of 6 human dentin specimens (A-F) were recessed in the buccal aspects of intra-oral appliances which were worn for 21 days by 11 volunteers. The samples were demineralised twice a day extra-orally in the acidic beverage Sprite Light (pH 2.9) for 90 s. Subsequently, the dentin specimens were brushed at different times. Specimen A was brushed immediately after demineralisation.
