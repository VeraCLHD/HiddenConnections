OBJECTIVE: To evaluate how the prevalence of atopic disease has changed in terms of detectable sensitization to aeroallergens and dietary allergens in a cross-sectional comparison of subjects from birth cohorts more than 60 years apart. METHODS: We studied four groups of 100 subjects each (at ages 7, 27, 47 and 67 years), representing those born in 1990, 1963-66, 1943-46 and in 1923-26, respectively. Serum total and specific IgE concentrations against aeroallergens and dietary allergens were determined.
