The HFM significantly increased total cholesterol by 4 +/- 1%, and triglycerides by 93 +/- 3%. ENO also increased (p < 0.05) due to the HFM by 19 +/- 1% (pre 17.2 +/- 1.6; post 20.6 +/- 1.7 ppb). ENO and triglycerides were significantly related at baseline and post-HFM (r = 0.82, 0.72 respectively).
