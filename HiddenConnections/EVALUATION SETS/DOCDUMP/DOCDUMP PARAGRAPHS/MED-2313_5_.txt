After 4 weeks of feeding on a high cholesterol diet (HCD), zebrafish exhibited serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels 2.5-fold higher than those fed a normal diet (ND). Within the experimental group, those fed acai demonstrated the lowest serum TC and CETP activity, while the LL-consuming group showed a reduction in serum TC and TG relative to HCD-fed fish. Serum glucose levels also increased in the HCD group, to threefold above the ND group; GS and LL feeding elicited the greatest reduction in hyperglycemia.
