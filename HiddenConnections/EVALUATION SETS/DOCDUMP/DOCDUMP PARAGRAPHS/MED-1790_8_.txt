RESULTS: Antigenic and/or molecular evidence of BLV was found in the cultured cells of 20 cows. Antigenic evidence of BLV was found in tissue sections from 10 cows, indicating virus expression in vivo. Simultaneous detection of BLV p24 and cytokeratins, localized antigen expression to the mammary epithelial cells.
