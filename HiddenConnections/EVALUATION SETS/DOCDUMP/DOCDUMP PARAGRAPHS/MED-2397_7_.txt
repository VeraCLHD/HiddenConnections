Had the subjects achieved even a 1-point increment in their lifestyle scores, death rates of 24.7% among men and 18.5% among women could have been reduced. CONCLUSION: We found an inverse association between baseline combination of 6 healthy lifestyle factors and all-cause mortality as well as its impact on preventable fraction of death. Our results also demonstrated that healthy lifestyle behaviors are important even in old age.
