The average daily intake of nitrates depends upon the amount of vegetables consumed and on the nitrate concentration in drinking water. Agricultural practices play an important part in the concentration of nitrate in both water and vegetables. If nitrate is taken up by the plant and not metabolised to amino acids, proteins or nucleic acids, it is stored in cell vacuoles as a reserve.
