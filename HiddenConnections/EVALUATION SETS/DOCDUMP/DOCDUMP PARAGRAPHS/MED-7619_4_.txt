Rectal challenge with CM and gluten was performed in 27 of these patients and in healthy controls (n = 18). After a 15-h challenge the mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the mucosal release of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured by using the mucosal patch technique. RESULTS: Twenty-seven per cent of the RA patients reported food intolerance (FI) to various foods, and in particular to CM, meat, and wheat gluten.
