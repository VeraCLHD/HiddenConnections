During the repeat HUT, prodromal symptoms with hypotension developed in 13 of the 21 patients and of these 5 fainted immediately after and were not able to do the physical maneuvers. Squatting and leg-crossing aborted syncope in 7 of 8 patients, but handgrip aborted syncope in only 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Squatting and leg-crossing with muscle tensing improved the hemodynamics of normal subjects as well as those of patients with vasovagal syncope.
