These environmental toxicants or their metabolites are inherent oxidants and/or directly or indirectly drive the production of a variety of reactive oxidants also known as reactive oxygen species. These are short-lived entities that are continuously generated at low levels during the course of normal aerobic metabolism. These are believed to activate proliferative and cell survival signaling that can alter apoptotic pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of skin disorders.
