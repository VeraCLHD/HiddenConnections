Methods: Relevant articles were obtained through a review of the medical literature and the strength of the available evidence was graded according to the American Academy of Neurology evidence classification scheme. Results: The accumulated Class III and IV evidence suggests an increased incidence of systolic dysfunction and therapy-related acute leukemia (TRAL) with mitoxantrone therapy. Systolic dysfunction occurs in ∼12% of patients with MS treated with mitoxantrone, congestive heart failure occurs in ∼0.4%, and leukemia occurs in ∼0.8%.
