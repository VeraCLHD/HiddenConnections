Abstract OBJECTIVE: Barrett's esophagus (BO) is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), a cancer with a poor prognosis and an increasing incidence. Hence there is an interest in mapping causal factors underlying BO and finding strategies to reduce the risk of dysplasia progression in patients with BO. Here we review current knowledge on established as well as less risk factors for the development of BO.
