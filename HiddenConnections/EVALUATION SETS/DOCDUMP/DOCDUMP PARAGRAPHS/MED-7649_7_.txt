Irrespective of MTGase addition, breaking force and deformation of all gels decreased as the storage time of lizardfish increased (P<0.05). The addition of MTGase was able to increase both breaking force and deformation of the resulting gel produced from lizardfish kept in ice for all storage times used. Therefore, both freshness and MTGase addition had the direct impact on gel properties of lizardfish mince.
