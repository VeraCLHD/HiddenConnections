RESULTS: Forty-nine patients (14.1%) (32 female, 17 male; mean age, 51.4 +/- 15.6 y; age range, 12-77 y) showed abnormal (18)F-FDG uptake in the supraclavicular region. Twenty patients (5.8%) had muscle uptake (group B); 15 (4.3%) had definite abnormal lymph nodes (group C). However, 14 patients (4.0%) had USA-fat (group A) and foci of very low Hounsfield units on CT.
