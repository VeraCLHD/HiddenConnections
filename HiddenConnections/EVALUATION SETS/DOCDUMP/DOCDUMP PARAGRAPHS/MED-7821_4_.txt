Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 45 and 90 d. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and triacylglycerols were evaluated by automated methods. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation. LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation.
