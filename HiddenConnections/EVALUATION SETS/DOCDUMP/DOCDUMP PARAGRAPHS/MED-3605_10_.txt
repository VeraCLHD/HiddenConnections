Elevated homocysteine was not associated with white matter hyperintensity volume or with hippocampal volume. Although homocysteine and folate levels were correlated, their effects on white matter volume were dissociated. CONCLUSION: In non demented, relatively healthy adults, elevated homocysteine is associated with lower cognitive scores and reduced cerebral white matter volume.
