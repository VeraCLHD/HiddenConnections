BACKGROUND: While acetaminophen is commonly used to treat migraine, there have been limited published clinical trial efficacy results. DESIGN/METHODS: Ten investigators at 13 private, ambulatory, primary care sites in the United States enrolled and treated 346 outpatient adults 18-72 years of age with migraine headache of moderate to severe intensity into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of 6 hours duration. Each patient was randomly assigned to a single dose of study medication of acetaminophen 1000 mg (n = 177) or placebo (n = 169).
