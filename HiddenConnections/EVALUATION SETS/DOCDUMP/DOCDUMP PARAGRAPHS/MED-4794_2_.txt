METHODS: We developed a multicohort natural history model to overcome limitations of previous models for predicting disease outcomes and benefits of therapy. RESULTS: Prevalence of CH-C peaked in 2001 at 3.6 million. Fibrosis progression was inversely related to age at infection, so cirrhosis and its complications were most common after the age of 60 years, regardless of when infection occurred.
