Participants in both the intervention and control groups experienced either small or no cognitive declines during the studies.The main reported side-effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation was mild gastrointestinal problems. Overall, minor adverse events were reported by fewer than 15% of participants, and reports were balanced between intervention groups.
