OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively examine the association between dietary acrylamide intake and renal cell, bladder, and prostate cancers. DESIGN: The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer includes 120,852 men and women aged 55-69 y. At baseline (1986), a random subcohort of 5000 participants was selected for a case-cohort analysis approach using Cox proportional hazards analysis.
