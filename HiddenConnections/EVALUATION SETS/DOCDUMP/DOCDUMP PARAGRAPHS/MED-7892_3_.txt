During a mean 10.6 years of follow-up, 144 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer were identified. Two matched controls for each patient were selected from the cohort. Isoflavone levels were assessed by plasma level and food frequency questionnaire, and the odds ratio of breast cancer according to isoflavone level was estimated using a conditional logistic regression model.
