Based on an average intake of 130 g/day refined sugars and the antioxidant activity measured in typical diets, substituting alternative sweeteners could increase antioxidant intake an average of 2.6 mmol/day, similar to the amount found in a serving of berries or nuts. CONCLUSION: Many readily available alternatives to refined sugar offer the potential benefit of antioxidant activity.
