At baseline, flow-mediated dilation was 4.5+/-2.6% in group 1, 4.01+/-1.6% in group 2, 4.4+/-4% in group 3, and 4.3+/-2.3% in group 4 (P=NS). After ET, flow-mediated dilation increased to 9.9+/-2.5% in group 1, 10.1+/-2.6% in group 2, and 10.8+/-3% in group 3 (P<0.01 versus baseline for all groups); it also increased in group 4 but to a much lesser extent (to 5.1+/-2.5%; P<0.01 versus trained groups). The von Willebrand factor level after ET decreased by 16% (P<0.01) similarly in groups 1, 2, and 3 but remained unchanged in group 4.
