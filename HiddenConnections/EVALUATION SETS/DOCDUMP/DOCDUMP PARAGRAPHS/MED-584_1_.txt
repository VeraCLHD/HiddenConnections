However, data from cohorts born preterm prior to the introduction of modern care suggest an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. For young adult cohorts of former very small or very preterm infants, there is accumulating evidence of increased risk factors for later cardiovascular disease, including higher blood pressure, lower lean body mass, impaired glucose regulation, and perhaps a more atherogenic lipid profile. Regarding lifestyle, adults born very small or very preterm undertake less non-conditioning physical activity and may have a lower intake of fruit and milk products.
