We repeated the meta-analysis after excluding four of the five studies from our laboratory to avoid possible bias in the result. In addition, we included two studies on serum copper levels in Alzheimer's disease not previously considered. The results indicate higher levels of copper in Alzheimer's disease patients than in controls, confirming our previous conclusion.
