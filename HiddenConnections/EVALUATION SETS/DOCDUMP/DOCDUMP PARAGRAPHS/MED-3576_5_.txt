Hydrated lips showed greater sensitivity to light touch, and there was a trend toward the lip's thermal sensitivity being altered consistent with the lip treatment having a physical cooling effect. Spatial acuity was unaltered by the state of lip hydration. The sensitivity changes on hydration were proposed to have mechanical basis.
