Participants continued their normal eating habits during the 12-week trial. At baseline and weeks 6 and 12, fasting blood and urine samples were collected, and adverse changes in bowel movements, frequency of burping or flatulence, and episodes of acid reflux were recorded. Reporting frequency for adverse events did not vary significantly by group during the trial; however, 50-56% of PCK and VIN participants reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event at week 6 as compared to 11% of REF participants (P = .110).
