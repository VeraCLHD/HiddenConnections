We aimed to investigate the association by carrying out a meta-analysis of prospective studies. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by using PubMed and EMBASE databases between January 1966 and April 2013 and also by manually reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. Summary relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using a random-effects model.
