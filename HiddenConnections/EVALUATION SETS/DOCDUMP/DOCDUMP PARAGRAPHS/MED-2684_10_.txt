It also inhibited GtfD activity associated with the synthesis of water-soluble glucans at a concentration which was lower than that used for inhibition of GtfB. VcPP had no effect on acidification associated with glucose utilization by S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: The current study supports the potential of VcPP as a food additive for reducing caries by inhibiting adhesion to the tooth surface and GtfD-mediated soluble glucan synthesis.
