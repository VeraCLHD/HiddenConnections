Abstract We studied the obstruction-relieving capabilities of transurethral electrovaporization of the prostate (TVP) in 32 symptomatic patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Urodynamic studies with pressure-flow analysis were performed before and 6 months after treatment. All 32 patients showed significant improvement of both subjective and objective obstruction parameters.
