33 patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to assess the efficacy and safety of cyclosporin (5 mg/kg per day) in adults with severe refractory atopic dermatitis. Treatments were given for eight weeks each with one group (n = 16) receiving placebo followed by cyclosporin and another (n = 17) receiving cyclosporin and then placebo. Disease activity, extent of disease, sleep and itch, topical steroid use, and adverse events were assessed every two weeks.
