Abstract INTRODUCTION: High low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In recent years, some evidence has been presented that periodontitis, an infectious inflammatory condition of the periodontium, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. To further elucidate this association, we have studied the levels of LDL cholesterol, a known risk marker for cardiovascular disease, in a periodontally-diseased group.
