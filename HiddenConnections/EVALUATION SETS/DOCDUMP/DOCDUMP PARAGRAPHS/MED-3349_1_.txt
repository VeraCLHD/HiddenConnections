A control meal without spinach and the test meals with spinach were balanced regarding energy (2000 kJ) and digestible carbohydrates (59 g, 51 E%) and with protein and fat as far as possible similar. The meals were served in the morning, after an overnight fast, to ten healthy male volunteers. Satiety was registered and blood glucose as well as plasma insulin and C-peptide were analysed at regular intervals until 3.5 h postprandially.
