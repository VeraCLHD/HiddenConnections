When individual diet components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio 2.36; 1.0â€“5.57; p=0.051) and higher caloric intake (p=0.035) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. Conclusion and Relevance MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion, however higher consumption of dairy products had a two-fold increased risk, and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD). Studies of diet and energy expenditure in premanifest HD may provide data for interventions to modify specific components of diet that may delay the onset of HD.
