Molecules with suitable structures absorb UV light and prevent direct damage of cellular targets. Phytoene and phytofluene are precursor molecules of higher unsaturated carotenoids and occur in various fruit and vegetables. Their absorption spectra cover the UVB and UVA range, respectively, thus potentially contributing to photoprotective effects of carotenoid-rich food.
