In the control group, the mean concentration of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin changed from 55.5 (95% CI: 48.7-63.2) ng/mg creatinine to 50.8 (95% CI: 44.0-58.7) ng/mg creatinine across the intervention period. A comparison of the two groups with regard to the changes in the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations across the intervention period showed a significant difference (P = 0.03). The results indicate that increased consumption of vegetables raises circulatory melatonin concentrations.
