Yet, differences were detected in the standardized trimmed primal yields. A difference (P < 0.05) in percentages of the side weight was detected for the Boston butt, trimmed loin, and trimmed ham. This translated into RAC pigs having a carcass cutting yield (74.70% vs. 73.69%, respectively; P = 0.02; SED = 0.33) advantage of 1.01% units and a bone in lean cutting yield (61.43% vs. 60.33%, respectively; P = 0.03; SED = 0.40) advantage of 1.10% units when compared with control pigs.
