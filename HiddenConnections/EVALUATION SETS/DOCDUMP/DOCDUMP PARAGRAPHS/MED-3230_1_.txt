During intracellular transport APP undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages that lead to the release either of an amyloidogenic fragment called β-amyloid (Aβ) or of a nonamyloidogenic secreted form consisting of the ectodomain of APP (APPsec). It is Aβ that accumulates in the brain lesions that are thought to cause the disease. By reducing the cellular cholesterol level of living hippocampal neurons by 70% with lovastatin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin, we show that the formation of Aβ is completely inhibited while the generation of APPsec is unperturbed.
