Waist circumference (P = 0.69), blood pressure (systolic, P = 0.83; diastolic, P = 0.79) and blood lipid panel (total cholesterol, P = 0.72; high-density lipoprotein, P = 0.11; total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein, P = 0.37; triglycerides, P = 0.89; low-density lipoprotein, P = 0.81) also did not change from baseline compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Two daily fruit and nut bars, totalling 1421.9 kJ (340 kcal), did not cause weight gain. The role of habitual snacking on nutrient dense and satiating foods on both weight over time, and diet quality, warrants further study.
