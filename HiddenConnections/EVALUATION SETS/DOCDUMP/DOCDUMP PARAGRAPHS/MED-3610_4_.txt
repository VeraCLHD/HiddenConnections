Breast milk and dust samples were analyzed for PBDEs using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. PBDE concentrations were log-normally distributed in breast milk and dust. We found statistically significant, positive associations between PBDE concentrations in breast milk and house dust (r = 0.76, p = 0.003, not including BDE-209), as well as with reported dietary habits, particularly the consumption of dairy products (r = 0.41, p = 0.005) and meat (r = 0.37, p = 0.01).
