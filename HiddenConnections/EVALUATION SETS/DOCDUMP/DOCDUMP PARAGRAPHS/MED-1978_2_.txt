A positive association was found between dairy intake and PD risk in men (relative risk [RR] comparing extreme categories, 1.8; p trend = 0.004), but not in women (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.9). No other food groups were associated with PD risk in either men or women. Further analyses among men showed significant positive associations with PD risk for intakes of several dairy foods as well as dairy calcium (RR, 1.5; p trend = 0.02), dairy vitamin D (RR, 1.6; p trend = 0.004), dairy protein (RR, 1.6; p trend = 0.01), and lactose (RR, 1.8; p trend = 0.002), but not dairy fat (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.4).
