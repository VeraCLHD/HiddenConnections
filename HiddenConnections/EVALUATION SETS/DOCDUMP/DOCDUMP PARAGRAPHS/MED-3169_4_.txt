Exploration of the chemical space utilized by bacteria will contribute to the development of new small molecule therapeutic agents, including new antibiotics. And genetically re-engineered bacteria are proving to be of potential value as actual therapeutic entities. Our understanding of our bacterial world has the capability to transform radically our current approach to human health diverting it from an emphasis on acute treatments to living in healthy harmony with both our internal and external environments.
