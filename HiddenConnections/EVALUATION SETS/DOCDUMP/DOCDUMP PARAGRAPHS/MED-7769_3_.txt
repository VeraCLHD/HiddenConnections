Stimulation of AMPK by curcumin resulted in the down-regulation of PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor)-gamma in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the decrease in COX-2 in MCF-7 cells. Application of a synthetic AMPK activator also supported the evidence that AMPK acts as an upstream signal of PPAR-gamma in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In cancer cells, AMPK was found to act as a regulator of ERK1/2, p38, and COX-2.
