Methods and Results The AHA construct of “cardiovascular health” and the AHA “ideal health behaviors index” and “ideal health factors index” were evaluated among 1933 participants (mean age 59 years; 44% blacks; 66% female) in the community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation study. One of 1933 participants (0.1%) met all 7 components of the AHA's definition of ideal cardiovascular health. Less than 10% of participants met ≥5 components of ideal cardiovascular health in all subgroups (by race, sex, age and income level).
