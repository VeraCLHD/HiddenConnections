We enrolled 222 consecutive patients who had undergone coronary angiography for suspected ischemic heart disease and were found to have normal or near-normal coronary arteries. Thereafter, 25(OH)D3 levels were measured and the coronary flow rate was assessed using the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count. Slow coronary flow (SCF) was defined as a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count greater than 27/frame.
