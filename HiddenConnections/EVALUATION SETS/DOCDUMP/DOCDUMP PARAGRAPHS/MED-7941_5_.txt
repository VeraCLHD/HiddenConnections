The experiment lasted 24 d. Fecal samples were gathered from d 3 to d 5 postinfection by total collection. Ten control and 10 infected birds fed each diet were sampled on d 6 and d 10 postinfection. The induced infection produced significant depressions in growth and feed intake and detrimental morphological changes in the small intestine of poults in the absence of mortality.
