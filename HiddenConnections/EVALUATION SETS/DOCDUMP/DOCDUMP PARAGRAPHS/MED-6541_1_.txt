Deep-frozen tarragon was clearly less genotoxic than methylchavicol at equivalent dose levels, and desiccated tarragon was negative. Both forms of tarragon tested in vitro have the ability to decrease significantly the genotoxicity of methylchavicol added to the culture medium at concentrations </=10 muM for deep-frozen and </=55 muM for desiccated tarragon. The decrease may be attributed to antimutagenic properties of tarragon leaves and/or to adsorption of methylchavicol, which would decrease its bioavailability.
