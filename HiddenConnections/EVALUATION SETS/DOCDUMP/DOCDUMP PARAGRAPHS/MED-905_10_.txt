CONCLUSION: Apart from IgE, alpha-Gal-specific ABs of all isotypes remained constant over longer time periods in healthy subjects. Thus, significant titer changes actually represent increased antigen exposure and a specific anti-alpha-Gal response. Crohn's disease patients display increased anti-Gal IgA titers compared with healthy controls, which reflects a chronically impaired mucosal gut barrier in this patient cohort.
