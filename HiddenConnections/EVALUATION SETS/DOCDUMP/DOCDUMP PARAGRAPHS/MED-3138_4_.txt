Beyond AT, these studies also tested Exposure only (E), Tension only, Applied Relaxation (AR), or a combination of AR and AT. Based on self-reported levels of anxiety, in-session avoidance and fainting, AT was superior over other conditions; however, when considering pre- to post-treatment effect sizes on BII-related questionnaires, E outperformed all other treatments. In addition, AT did not yield better results on physiological measures, and individuals with BII fears improved similarly within studies across treatment groups, regardless of fainting status.
