There were no significant differences detected among groups in triglycerides, fasting glucose and 2 hour postprandial glucose following a 75 gram glucose challenge. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that glucose values 2 h after a 75 gm glucose challenge were significantly lower at week 12 compared with baseline values in the HSG group (-1.13 ± 2.58 mmol/L, p = 0.02), and a similar trend was noted in the RSG group (-0.77 ± 2.07 mmol/L, p = 0.06), while no significant change was seen in the DCG group (-0.15 ± 2.27 mmol/L, p = 0.530). At the end of study, serum triglyceride levels were significantly lower compared with baseline in the RSG group (-0.38 ± 0.79 mmol/L, p = 0.018), but no significant changes were observed in the HSG or DCG groups.
