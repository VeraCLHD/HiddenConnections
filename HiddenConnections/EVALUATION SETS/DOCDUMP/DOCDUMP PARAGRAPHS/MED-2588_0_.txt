Abstract Several recent studies document a beneficial effect of breast-feeding on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The mechanisms involved are still in need of elucidation, but evidence is accruing that the fatty acid (FA) composition of human milk plays a role. The composition of body fats, from circulating erythrocyte lipids to brain phospholipids, is linked in infants to the early feeding mode and which FA predominates among circulating lipids influences visual and neurodevelopmental performance test scores.
