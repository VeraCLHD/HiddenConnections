The active phase of the disease is short, concordant with the latency of a primary adaptive immune response. Triggers for GBS include infection and (rarely) vaccination; cross-reactivity between infectious and neural epitopes has been well demonstrated, particularly for Campylobacter jejuni and motor axonal forms of GBS in which non-protein gangliosides are antigenic. Most people are probably exposed to a GBS trigger, but only rarely does the disease develop.
