AA-Hb and GA-Hb concentrations measured in blood samples were related to mortality by Cox proportional hazard models. Estimates are given per 25 pmol/g globin higher levels. Among non-smokers, higher concentrations of GA-Hb were associated to a higher hazard rate of breast cancer specific mortality (HR (95% CI): 1.63 (1.06-2.51)), the hazard rate among women diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive tumors was (HR (95% CI): 2.23 (1.38-3.61)).
