Total fluid intake did not differ between groups but milk intake among the constipated children was marginally higher than the non-constipated children (P = 0.055) CONCLUSION: Insufficient dietary fibre intake is common in Hong Kong pre-school children. Constipated children had significantly lower intakes of dietary fibre and micronutrients including vitamin C, folate and magnesium than non-constipated counterparts which was attributable to under-consumption of plant foods. However, milk intake was marginally higher in the constipated children.
