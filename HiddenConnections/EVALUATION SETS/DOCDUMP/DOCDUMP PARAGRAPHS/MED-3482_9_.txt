No correlation was found between endothelial impairment and postprandial triglyceride increment (r=-0.22, p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found in the acute adverse effect of the ingestion of different vegetable oils on the endothelial function. All the vegetable oils, fresh and deep-fried, produced an increase in the triglyceride plasma levels in healthy subjects.
