After discontinuation of PRF (≥3 weeks), 48/51 fetuses (96%) showed complete reversal of DC, with decrease in mean ductal systolic velocity (1.74±0.20 m s(-1) to 1.31±0.34 m s(-1), P<0.001), mean diastolic velocity (0.33±0.09 m s(-1) to 0.21±0.07 m s(-1), P<0.001) and mean right to left ventricular dimension ratio (1.37±0.26 to 1.12±0.17, P<0.001) and increase in mean ductal pulsatility index (PI) (1.98±0.36 to 2.46±0.23, P<0.001). Median daily maternal consumption of PRF was 286 mg per day and decreased after orientation to 0 mg per day, P<0.001. In the control group, with GA of 32±4 w (29-37 w), there was no significant differences in median daily maternal consumption of PRF, mean ductal systolic velocitiy, diastolic velocity, PI and right ventricular to left ventricular diameter ratio (RV/LV) ratio.
