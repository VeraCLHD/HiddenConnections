There were gene specific differences, the PS2 and TGFbeta3 genes were about equally sensitive to Zeranol, 17beta-oestradiol and DES whereas a down-regulation of MRG1/p35srj could be detected at fmol/l concentrations of Zeranol whereas 17beta-oestradiol was several orders of magnitude less potent. GST mu3 was sensitive to fmol/l concentrations of 17beta-oestradiol but much less sensitive to Zeranol and DES. The very high potency of Zeranol compared with other potential endocrine disrupters suggests that Zeranol intake from beef products could have greater impact on consumers than the amounts of the known or suspected endocrine disrupters that have been found in food.
