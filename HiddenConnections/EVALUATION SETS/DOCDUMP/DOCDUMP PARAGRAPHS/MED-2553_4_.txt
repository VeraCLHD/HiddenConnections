However, these differences were much smaller than those with nicotine (1971 +/- 818 vs 132 +/- 82 ng g(-1), p <0.0001) and cotinine (1237 +/- 818 vs <35 ng g(-1)) in toenail and those of cotinine (97.43 +/- 84.54 vs 1.85 +/- 4.50 ng ml(-1), p <0.0001) in saliva. These results were confirmed in plasma samples from 84 patients undergoing gastro-oesophageal endoscopy. Differences between 25 smokers and 59 non-smokers are again much lower for myosmine (0.30 +/- 0.35 vs 0.16 +/- 0.18 ng ml(-1), p <0.05) than for cotinine (54.67 +/- 29.63 vs 0.61 +/- 1.82 ng ml(-1), p <0.0001).
