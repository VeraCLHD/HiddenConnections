The PBDE levels varied from 160.5 pg g(-1) wet wt in C. hamatus muscle to 789.9 pg g(-1) wet wt in T. bernacchii liver and were lower than the levels of PCBs. PCBs were the main organochlorine compounds detected and their concentrations ranged from 0.3 ng g(-1) wet wt in C. hamatus muscle to 15.1 ng g(-1) wet wt in T. bernacchii liver. TEQ concentrations resulted higher in C. hamatus than in T. bernacchii and were due mainly to PCDDs.
