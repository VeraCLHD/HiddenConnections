This review focuses on the nutritional aspect of phytochemicals in humans-ie, the provision of carotenoid micronutrients by dietary means to the skin and their role in protection. Human intervention studies have documented protective effects for Î²-carotene or for lycopene provided either by a carotenoid-rich diet or by supplementation. In exposed tissues, light induces primary and secondary photooxidative processes.
