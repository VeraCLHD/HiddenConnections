We evaluated the rectal pain threshold at baseline and after conditioning (repetitive rectal painful distention: RRD) in patients with IBS or functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), which is an abdominal pain disorder, and in healthy controls, and determined whether rectal hypersensitivity is a reliable marker for IBS. METHODS: The rectal sensory threshold was assessed by a barostat. First, a ramp distention of 40 ml/min was induced, and the threshold of pain and the maximum tolerable pressure (mmHg) were measured.
