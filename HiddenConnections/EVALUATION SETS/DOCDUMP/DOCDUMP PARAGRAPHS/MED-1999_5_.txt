The Hervey's hypothesis which suggests that fat cells take up and catabolize glucocorticoids is one of the possible regulatory effect that supports the adaptive role of visceral fat in response to stress. This is also supported by other evidence showing that abdominal obesity is associated with an increased cortisol clearance. Hormonal and enzymatic changes have been implicated in this preferential body fat accumulation in response to stress.
