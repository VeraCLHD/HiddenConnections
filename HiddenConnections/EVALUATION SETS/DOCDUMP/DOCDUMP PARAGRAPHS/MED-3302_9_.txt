In the control group, with GA of 32±4 w (29-37 w), there was no significant differences in median daily maternal consumption of PRF, mean ductal systolic velocitiy, diastolic velocity, PI and right ventricular to left ventricular diameter ratio (RV/LV) ratio. CONCLUSION: Reduction of maternal PRF intake during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, is followed by complete reversal of DC (wide open DA), which may influence maternal dietary habits in late pregnancy.
