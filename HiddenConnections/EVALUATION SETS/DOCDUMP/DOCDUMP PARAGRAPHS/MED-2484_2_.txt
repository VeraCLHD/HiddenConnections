In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of balsamic vinegar on LDL oxidation and foam cell formation. Balsamic vinegar had stronger 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging abilities and higher polyphenol concentrations than rice vinegar. Balsamic vinegar dramatically inhibited LDL oxidation by azoradicals and endothelial cell-mediated oxidation in vitro.
