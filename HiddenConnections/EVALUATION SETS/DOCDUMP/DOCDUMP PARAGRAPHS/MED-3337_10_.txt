With regard to the loss of surface contour of the tooth samples following immersion in the drinks, as assessed by depth loss, there were significant differences between the drinks (p = 0.0064) with the thickie and negative control not causing depth loss and the kiwi, apple and lime smoothie producing most depth loss (28.26 (5.45) Î¼m). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study some fruit smoothies have the potential to bring about dental erosion if consumed irresponsibly. This can be influenced by ingredient variations.
