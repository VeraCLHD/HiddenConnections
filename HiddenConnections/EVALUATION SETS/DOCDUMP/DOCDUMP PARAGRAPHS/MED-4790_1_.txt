Such dietary interventions are frequently used to modulate animal performance or therapeutically for monogastric livestock. In this study, changes in gene expression induced by these three interventions in cultured "Intestinal Porcine Epithelial Cells" (IPEC-J2) recorded after a short-term period of 2 and 6 hours, were compared to the in vivo gene expression profiles in order to evaluate the capability of this in vitro bioassay in predicting in vivo responses. METHODS: Lists of response genes were analysed with bioinformatics programs to identify common biological pathways induced in vivo as well as in vitro.
