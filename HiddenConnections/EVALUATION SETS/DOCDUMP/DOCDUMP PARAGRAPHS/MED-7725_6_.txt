Hearts of 68 seropositive lambs were used for isolation of viable T. gondii by bioassay in cats, mice or both. For bioassays in cats, the entire myocardium or 500g was chopped and fed to cats, one cat per heart and faeces of the recipient cats were examined for shedding of T. gondii oocysts. For bioassays in mice, 50g of the myocardium was digested in an acid pepsin solution and the digest inoculated into mice; the recipient mice were examined for T. gondii infection.
