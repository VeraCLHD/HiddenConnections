Abstract Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has become by far the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug in the US. In 2008, 47.8 million prescriptions were written for HCTZ alone and 87.1 million prescriptions for HCTZ combinations. However, there is no evidence that HCTZ in its usual dose of 12.5-25 mg daily reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, or death.
