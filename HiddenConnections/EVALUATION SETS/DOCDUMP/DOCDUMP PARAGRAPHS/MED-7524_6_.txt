Further analyses indicated that some of this risk may be attributable to obesity and/or weight gain--both of which were strong risk factors in this cohort. It is noteworthy that even after control for weight and weight change, weekly meat intake remained an important risk factor (OR = 1.38; 95% CI 1.06-1.68) for diabetes [corrected]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings raise the possibility that meat intake, particularly processed meats, is a dietary risk factor for diabetes.
