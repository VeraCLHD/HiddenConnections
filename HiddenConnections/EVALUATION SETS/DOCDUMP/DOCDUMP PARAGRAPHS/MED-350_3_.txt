Subjects ingested one and two cups of decaffeinated Italian espresso coffee in random order at 5- to 7-day intervals. RESULTS: In the hour following the ingestion of two cups of DC, FMD increased (mean+/-s.e.m.): 0 min, 7.4+/-0.7%; 30 min, 8.0+/-0.6%; 60 min, 10.8+/-0.8%; P<0.001) as compared to consumption of one cup of DC (0 min, 6.9+/-0.7%; 30 min, 8.4+/-1.2%; 60 min, 8.5+/-1.1%; 3 x 2 repeated-measures analysis of variance: P=0.037 for time x treatment effect). Blood pressure did not differ between groups, and basal heart rate was lower in the two-cup group at baseline and 60 min.
