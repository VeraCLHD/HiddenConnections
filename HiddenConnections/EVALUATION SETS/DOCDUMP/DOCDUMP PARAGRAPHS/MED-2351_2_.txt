Under polarized light these lipid droplets exhibited strong birefringence suggesting that some of the cholesterol was present in the form of crystals. Activated Kupffer cells aggregated around dead hepatocytes that included strongly birefringent cholesterol crystals, forming “crown-like structures” similar to those recently described in inflamed visceral adipose tissue. These Kupffer cells appeared to process the lipid of dead hepatocytes turning it into activated lipid-laden “foam cells” with numerous small cholesterol-containing droplets.
