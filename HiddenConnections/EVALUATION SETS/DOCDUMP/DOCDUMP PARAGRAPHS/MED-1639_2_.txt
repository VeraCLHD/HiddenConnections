After frying, patties were analyzed for 15 different HAA by HPLC-analysis. Four HAA MeIQx (0.3-0.6 ng/g), PhIP (0.02-0.06 ng/g), co-mutagenic norharmane (0.4-0.7 ng/g), and harmane (0.8-1.1 ng/g) were found at low levels. The concentration of MeIQx was reduced by about 50% and 40% by applying marinades containing the highest amount of extract compared to sunflower oil and control marinade, respectively.
