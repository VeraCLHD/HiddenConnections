Anti-Gal specifically bound to GD thyrocytes and induced an increase in cAMP synthesis, 125I uptake, and DNA synthesis in these cells. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of autologous sera on GD thyrocytes were greatly reduced after specific depletion of anti-Gal from these sera. No binding and no stimulatory effects of anti-Gal were observed, however, with normal human thyrocytes and with thyrocytes from thyrotoxic patients who lack thyroid-stimulating Igs or thyrotropin binding inhibiting Igs.
