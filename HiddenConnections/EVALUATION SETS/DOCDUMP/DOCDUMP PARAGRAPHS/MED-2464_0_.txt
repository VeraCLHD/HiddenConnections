Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)-a prediabetic state-is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. Acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, was shown in the placebo-controlled prospective study to prevent noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (STOP-NIDDM) trial to reduce the risk of diabetes by 36% in IGT subjects. This article reports on a placebo-controlled subgroup analysis of the STOP-NIDDM study to examine the efficacy of acarbose to slow progression of intima-media thickness (IMT) in subjects with IGT.
