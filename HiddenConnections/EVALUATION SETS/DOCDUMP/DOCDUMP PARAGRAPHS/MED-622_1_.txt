We therefore sought to determine whether interventions (including diet, exercise and pharmacological therapy), altered all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality in such subjects. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were identified in the medical literature and databases. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they reported all-cause mortality rates (at a minimum), recruited approximately 100 patients and had a minimum follow-up of one year.
