The dose is expressed in terms of number or surface of deposited particles. This permits to address the dosimetry of very small particles, which are released by many indoor sources but represent a slight fraction of the particulate matter mass. The enhancement of the internal dose resulting from fine and ultrafine particles generated during the cooking event vs. the dose when no indoor source is active is assessed.
