PhIP is metabolized by cytochrome P-450s producing N-OH-PhIP. The N-OH-PhIP can be esterified by phase II enzymes forming an arylnitrenium ion that binds to DNA causing adducts. Furthermore, N-OH-PhIP may be reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase producing superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals causing DNA strand breaks.
