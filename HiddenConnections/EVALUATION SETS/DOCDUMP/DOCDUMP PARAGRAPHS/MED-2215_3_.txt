Autoradiography, alone or combined with immunohistochemistry when applied to in vivo drug targeting and target characterization, has provided information on cellular-subcellular receptor distribution in over 50 tissues. These discoveries, importantly, contribute to a new understanding of the biological role of vitamin D and challenge the concept of "the calcium homeostatic steroid hormone" as being too narrow. While some of the outstanding effects of vitamin D deficiency and toxicity relate to calcium homeostasis, the vast majority of the target tissues appear not to be primarily related to calcium metabolism, but rather to the activation and regulation of exo- and endocrine secretory and somatotrophic processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation.
