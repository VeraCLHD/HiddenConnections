Abstract This is a review of the side-effects of cyclosporin A (CyA) in patients with severe psoriasis; renal dysfunction and hypertension are discussed elsewhere. In particular, paraesthesia, hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia and gastrointestinal disorders may occur, but are generally transient, mild-to-moderate in severity and only rarely require discontinuation of CyA. Infections are not a problem.
