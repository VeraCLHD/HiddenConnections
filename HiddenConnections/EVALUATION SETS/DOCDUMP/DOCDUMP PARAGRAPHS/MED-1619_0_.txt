Abstract Seven cyclists exercised at 70% of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) until fatigue (170 +/- 9 min) on three occasions, 1 wk apart. During these trials, plasma glucose declined from 5.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.1 mM (P less than 0.001) and respiratory exchange ratio (R) fell from 0.87 +/- 0.01 to 0.81 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001). After resting 20 min the subjects attempted to continue exercise either 1) after ingesting a placebo, 2) after ingesting glucose polymers (3 g/kg), or 3) when glucose was infused intravenously ("euglycemic clamp").
