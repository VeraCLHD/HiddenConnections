Gemfibrozil treatment increased LDL size and lowered numbers of LDL particles (-5%) while raising numbers of HDL particles (10%) and small HDL subclass particles (21%). Concentrations of these LDL and HDL particles achieved with gemfibrozil were significant, independent predictors of new CHD events. For total LDL and HDL particles, odds ratios predicting CHD benefit were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.47) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.81), respectively.
