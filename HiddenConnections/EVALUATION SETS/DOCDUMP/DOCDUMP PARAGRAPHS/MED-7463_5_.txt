However, we found that the MnSOD 9Ala allele was associated with an increased prostate cancer risk (Val/Ala versus Val/Val: odds ratio (OR)=1.1; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.0-1.3; Ala/Ala versus Val/Val: OR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.6; Val/Ala+Ala/Ala versus Val/Val: OR=1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3). In addition, we found that the MnSOD Ala-9Ala genotype contributed to an increased breast cancer risk in premenopausal women who had low consumption of antioxidants (Ala/Ala versus Val/Ala+Val/Val: OR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.4 with low vitamin C consumption; OR=2.1, 95%CI: 1.3-3.4 with low vitamin E consumption and OR=2.9, 95%CI: 1.5-5.7 with low carotenoid consumption). These results suggest that the MnSOD Val-9Ala polymorphism may contribute to cancer development through a disturbed antioxidant balance.
