Abstract Two major changes in the epidemiology of non-typhoidal salmonellosis have occurred during the second half of the 20th century. First, Salmonella typhimurium strains resistant to multiple antibiotics have emerged and spread within populations of food animals. Secondly, Salmonella enteritidis has emerged as a major egg-associated pathogen.
