Abstract The deleterious effects of tumor-promoting tobacco carcinogen, nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK, nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone) have undoubtedly been stipulated. Though many tobacco agents play a part in the development of lung tumors, the potent effects of NNK remain unmatched. It is therefore critical to distinguish the variety of cofactors involved in NNK-mediated pathogenesis, and the unique pathways necessary for successful cellular biotransformation.
