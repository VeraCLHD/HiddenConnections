Abstract PURPOSE: To identify if whole-body hydration plays an important role in dry eye (DE). We hypothesized that individuals classified as DE have higher plasma osmolality (Posm), indicating suboptimal hydration, compared with those classified as non-DE. METHODS: Using a hospital-based observational cross-sectional design, assessment of DE and hydration was performed upon admission in 111 participants (N = 56 males and 55 females; mean ± SD age 77 ± 8 years).
