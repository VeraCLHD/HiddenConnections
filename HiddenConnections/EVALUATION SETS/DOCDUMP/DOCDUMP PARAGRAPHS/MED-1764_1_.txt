Survival after ovarian cancer is poor, but the association with vitamin D has rarely been examined. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a marker of vitamin D status, and ovarian cancer survival. DESIGN: Participants were women with invasive ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 who participated in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study.
