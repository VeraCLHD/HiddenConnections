Oral glucose tolerance tests (75 g glucose) were conducted in the urban setting and repeated at the end of 7 wk of traditional lifestyle. The marked improvement in glucose was due to both a fall in fasting glucose (11.6 +/- 1.2 mM before, 6.6 +/- 0.8 mM after) and an improvement in postprandial glucose clearance (incremental area under the glucose curve: 15.0 +/- 1.2 mmol/L/h before, 11.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L/h after). Fasting plasma insulin concentration fell (23 +/- 2 mU/L before, 12 +/- 1 mU/L after) and the insulin response to glucose improved (incremental area under the insulin curve: 61 +/- 18 mU/L/h before, 104 +/- 21 mU/L/h after).
