Narrower retinal arteriolar caliber and smaller arteriovenous ratio are associated with older age; higher levels of past, current, and future blood pressure and obesity; and predict the incidence of diabetes and coronary heart disease. Wider retinal venular caliber, in contrast, is associated with younger age; impaired fasting glucose and diabetes; dyslipidemia; obesity; systemic marker of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cigarette smoking; and predicts the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. New data from family and twin studies indicate a significant genetic contribution to retinal vascular caliber, an area that is under investigation.
