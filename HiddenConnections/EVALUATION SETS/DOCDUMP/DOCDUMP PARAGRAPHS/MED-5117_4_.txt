Moreover, fluorescent labeling of proteins on the MP surface suggested immunoglobulins to be trapped inside, which was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis on permeabilized and nonpermeabilized plaque MPs. Colabeling for CD14 and IgG established that more than 90% of the IgG containing MPs were CD14(+), indicating a macrophage origin. Screening against an antigen library revealed that the immunologic profiles of antibodies in MPs were similar to those found in plaques but differed profoundly from antibodies in plasma and unexpectedly, showed strong reactions with oligosaccharide antigens, in particular blood group antigen A. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that immunoglobulins are present within MPs derived from plaque macrophages, that the portfolio of plaque antibodies is different from circulating antibodies in plasma, and that anticarbohydrate antibodies are retained in human atherosclerotic lesions.
