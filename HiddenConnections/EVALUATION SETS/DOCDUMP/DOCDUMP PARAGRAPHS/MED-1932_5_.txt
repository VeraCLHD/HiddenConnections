Longitudinal data of skeletal muscle mass were analyzed using a general linear mixed-effect model. RESULTS: The prevalence of low muscle mass at the first wave of examinations was 27.1% in men and 16.4% in women. Longitudinal analysis showed that skeletal muscle mass decreased with aging during the 12-year study period except in middle-aged men, and to a greater extent in elderly men (P for trend, <0.001).
