Our specific objectives were to estimate or test: prevalence of Y. enterocolitica shedding in finisher pigs, bioserotype distribution, agreement between the herd-level tests based on sampling pig and pooled fecal samples, whether bioserotypes cluster by farms, and whether Y. enterocolitica-positive herds cluster spatially. In total, 3747 fecal samples were collected from 100 farms over the years 2001, 2002, and 2004 (250 total herd visits). Fecal samples were tested by culture and positive isolates were biotyped and serotyped.
