The nutritional intervention (oral instructions, written leaflet, phoning) and food assessment were carried out by a research dietitian. RESULTS: At baseline, diets and the daily urine composition did not differ between the three groups. At four months, while diets differed significantly, the 24-hour output of calcium and oxalate did not differ significantly within and between groups after adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, and personal and family history of calcium stones) and baseline values.
