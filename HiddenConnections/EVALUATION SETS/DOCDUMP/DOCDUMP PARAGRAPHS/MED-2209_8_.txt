Vitamin D had no significant effects on insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: MD −0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.30 to 0.22, I-squared statistic (I2) = 45%], insulin secretion (homeostasis model of β-cell function: MD 1.64; 95% CI −25.94 to 29.22, I2 = 40%), or hemoglobin A1c (MD −0.05%; 95% CI −0.12 to 0.03, I2 = 55%) compared with controls. Four RCTs reported on the progression to new diabetes and found no effect of vitamin D (odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10, I2 = 0%). Adverse events were rare, and there was no evidence of publication bias.
