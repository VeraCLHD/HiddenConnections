There was a greater difference in serum bicarbonate between the highest and lowest quartiles of NEAP among patients with stage 4/5 CKD (−2.43 mEq/L, P < 0.001) compared with those with stage 2/3 disease (−0.77 mEq/L, P = 0.01; P-interaction = 0.02). Conclusions Reducing NEAP, through reduction of dietary protein and increased intake of fruits and vegetables, may prevent metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD.
