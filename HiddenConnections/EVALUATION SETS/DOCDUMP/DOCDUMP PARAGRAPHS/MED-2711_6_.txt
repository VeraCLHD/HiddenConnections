Also, the microtubule-associated protein tau, as an in vitro model for proteins relevant to AD pathology, was found capable of adventitious binding of copper and iron in a redox-competent manner. Our findings suggest that neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques contain redox-active transition metals and may thereby exert prooxidant or possibly antioxidant activities, depending on the balance among cellular reductants and oxidants in the local microenvironment.
