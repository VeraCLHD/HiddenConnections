When iron requirements are increased, hepcidin levels decline and more iron enters the plasma. It has been proposed that the level of circulating diferric transferrin, which reflects tissue iron levels, acts as a signal to alter hepcidin expression. In the liver, the proteins HFE, transferrin receptor 2 and hemojuvelin may be involved in mediating this signal as disruption of each of these molecules decreases hepcidin expression.
