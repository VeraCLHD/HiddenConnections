In multivariable linear regression analyses, there was an inverse association of PRA change with systolic BP change on the control diet (slope=-0.35, P=0.001), but PRA did not differ by BP change on the F/V diet (slope=-0.002, P=0.98) or DASH diet (slope=-0.08, P=0.32). These data suggest that a blunted counter-regulatory response of the renin-angiotensin system is associated with the BP-lowering effect of the F/V and DASH diets.
