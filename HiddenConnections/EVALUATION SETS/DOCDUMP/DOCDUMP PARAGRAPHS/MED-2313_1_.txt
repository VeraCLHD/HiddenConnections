The compounds were evaluated by in vitro antioxidant assay using a macrophage model and for in vivo hypolipidemic activity using zebrafish. In assays in vitro, all extracts demonstrated potent ferric ion reductive capacity, radical-scavenging activity and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Extracts could also abrogate fructose-mediated protein glycation and mildly inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).
