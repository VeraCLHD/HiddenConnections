However, in many patients with Type 2 DM and in those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), fasting blood glucose may be within normal limits, and hyperglycemia occurred only post-prandially. METHODS: With ultrasound technique, we measured flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation during oral glucose tolerance test in 58 subjects: (17 patients with normal glucose tolerance [NGT], 24 with IGT, and 17 with type 2 DM). In addition, we measured the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nitrite/nitrate.
