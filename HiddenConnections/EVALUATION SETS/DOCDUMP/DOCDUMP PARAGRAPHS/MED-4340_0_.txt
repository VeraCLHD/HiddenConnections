Abstract The estrogens estrone (E1), 17alpha-estradiol (E2alpha), 17beta-estradiol (E2beta), and estriol (E3) are natural sex hormones produced by humans and animals. In addition, there are some synthetic estrogens, such as 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), used for contraception purposes. These compounds are able to produce endocrine disruption in living organisms at nanogram-per-liter levels.
