Cyclo-oxygenase converts arachidonic acid to unstable cyclic endoperoxides from which prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes are derived. Formation of the leukotrienes from arachidonic acid is initiated by the action of 5-lipoxygenase producing leukotriene A4. Hydrolysis of leukotriene A4, or the incorporation of glutathione results in the formation of leukotriene B4 and C4, respectively.
