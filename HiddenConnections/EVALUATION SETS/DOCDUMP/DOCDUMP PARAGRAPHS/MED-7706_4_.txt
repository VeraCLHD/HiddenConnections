Results Normal human peritoneal fibroblasts expressed type I collagen, VEGF and TGF-β1. Exposure of normal human fibroblasts to PCB-77, PCB-105, PCB-153 or PCB-180 did not affect mRNA levels of β-actin, the house keeping gene used to normalized RNA levels for the real-time RT/PCR, nor did it affect cell viability as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. PCB treatments, compared to control, resulted in no significant change for TGF-β1 or VEGF mRNA levels, in normal peritoneal and adhesion fibroblasts.
