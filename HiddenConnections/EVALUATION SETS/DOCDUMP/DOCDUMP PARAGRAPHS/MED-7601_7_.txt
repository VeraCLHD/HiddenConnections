In multiple linear regression analyses, the colas vs. serum lipid associations prevailed (p < 0.001) after including 13 possible confounders: sex; age group; time since last meal; physical activity; intake of alcohol, coffee, cheese, fruit and (or) berries, and fatty fish; smoking; length of education; use of cholesterol-lowering drugs; and intake of non-colas. Thus, the self-reported intake frequency of colas, but not other soft drinks, was negatively associated with serum HDL, and positively associated with TG and LDL.
