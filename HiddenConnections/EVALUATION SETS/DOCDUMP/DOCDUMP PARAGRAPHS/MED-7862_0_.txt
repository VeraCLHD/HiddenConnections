Abstract BACKGROUND: Acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen, was recently detected in various heat-treated carbohydrate-rich foods. Epidemiologic studies on the relation with cancer have been few and largely negative. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively examine the association between dietary acrylamide intake and renal cell, bladder, and prostate cancers.
