Fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were collected at the beginning and end of trial. Serum creatinine, cystatin C, urea, angiotensin-converting enzyme, minerals and 24-h urinary creatinine and minerals were analyzed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations.
