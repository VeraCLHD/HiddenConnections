Abstract BACKGROUND: Beta-carotene has been shown to enhance immune functions in humans. Whether vegetables rich in carotenoids, such as beta-carotene or lycopene, modulate immune functions in healthy humans is presently not known. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a low-carotenoid diet supplemented with either tomato (providing high amounts of lycopene) or carrot juice (providing high amounts of alpha- and beta-carotene) on immune functions in healthy men.
