On the thymocyte side, several molecules have been newly implicated in the pathway from initial T-cell receptor signaling through to the final result: gene transcription and thymocyte apoptosis. In addition, several proapoptotic molecules have been found to be necessary for the death of self-reactive thymocytes. On the antigen-presenting cell side, the expression of peripheral self-antigens, regulated at least in part by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein, is crucial for complete elimination of autoreactive thymocytes.
