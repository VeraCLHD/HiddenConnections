Reductions for males average 0.6% lower than for females. The estimated increase in life expectancy is 2 years for all six regions. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels is the most cost-effective way to reduce global mortality rates, as the cost of vitamin D is very low and there are few adverse effects from oral intake and/or frequent moderate UVB irradiance with sufficient body surface area exposed.
