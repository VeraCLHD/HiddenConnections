Hyperlipidemic patients with higher levels of free copper seemed more prone to worse cognitive impairment. Free copper at baseline correlated with the ADL and IADL clinical scales scores at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: These results show an association between copper deregulation and unfavorable evolution of cognitive function in Alzheimer disease.
