RESULTS: Significantly (P = .001) more patients treated with acetaminophen 1000 mg reported mild to no pain after 2 hours (52.0%) compared with those treated with placebo (32.0%). The mean pain intensity difference from baseline measured at 2 hours was significantly (P < .001) greater for patients treated with acetaminophen 1000 mg (0.82) compared with those treated with placebo (0.46). A significant difference in favor of acetaminophen 1000 mg over placebo was also observed at 1 hour after treatment for the percentage of patients with mild to no pain and for mean pain intensity difference from baseline.
