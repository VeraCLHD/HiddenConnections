In vitro, a simple extract of kiwifruit, buffered to pH 7, was more effective than a solution of vitamin C (of equivalent concentration) at protecting DNA from damage, whereas at the highest concentrations tested, neither kiwi extract nor vitamin C had a protective effect. We have demonstrated significant antioxidant activity of kiwifruit ex vivo and in vitro, not attributable entirely to the vitamin C content of the fruit. Our dual approach is appropriate for testing other fruit and vegetable products for potential antioxidant effects.
