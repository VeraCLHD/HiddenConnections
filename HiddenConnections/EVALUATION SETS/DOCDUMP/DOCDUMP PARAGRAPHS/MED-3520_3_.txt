This review explores salt reduction in the diet at the population-wide level as a means of reducing the burden of hypertension in Nigeria. The evidence behind this strategy is explored, methods of how this goal was achieved in other countries are investigated and recommendations on how it could be accomplished in the Nigerian context are considered. There are suggestions that if salt reductions are effectively implemented on a population-wide basis, it will have an impact on morbidity and mortality as large as that which the provision of drains and safe water had in the 19(th) century.
