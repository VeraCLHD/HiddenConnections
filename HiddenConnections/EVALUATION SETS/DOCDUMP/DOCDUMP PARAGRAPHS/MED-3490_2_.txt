METHODS: Diluted human blood cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide in the presence of phenolics (vanillic, p-coumaric, syringic, homovanillic and caffeic acids, kaempferol, oleuropein glycoside, and tyrosol) at concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-4) M. Concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 and of the inflammatory eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Oleuropein glycoside and caffeic acid decreased the concentration of interleukin-1beta. At a concentration of 10(-4) M, oleuropein glycoside inhibited interleukin-1beta production by 80%, whereas caffeic acid inhibited production by 40%.
