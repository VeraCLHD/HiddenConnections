Regular physical exercise, which is known to promote a favourable cardiovascular state, may improve endothelial function via several mechanisms. Indeed, it augments blood flow and laminar shear stress, resulting in increased nitric oxide production and bioavailability. In this regard, the beneficial effects of training on endothelial function can be mediated in a number of ways, including synthesis of molecular mediators, changes in neurohormonal release and oxidant/antioxidant balance.
