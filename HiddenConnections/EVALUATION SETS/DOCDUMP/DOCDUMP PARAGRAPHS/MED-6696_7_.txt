All foods, pharmaceuticals and toothpastes were examined for microparticle content, and intakes of Ca and exogenous microparticles were compared between the two groups. Dietary intakes were significantly different between cases and controls for dietary fibre (12 (SD 5) v. 14 (SD 5) g/d; P=0.001) and sucrose (52 (SD 27) v. 45 (SD 18) g/d; P=0.04) but not for Ca. Estimated median TiO2 and Psil intakes (2.5 and 35 mg/individual per d respectively, totalling 10(12)-10(13) microparticles/individual per d) were broadly similar to per capita estimates and while there was wide variation in intakes between individuals there was no significant difference between subjects with CD and controls.
