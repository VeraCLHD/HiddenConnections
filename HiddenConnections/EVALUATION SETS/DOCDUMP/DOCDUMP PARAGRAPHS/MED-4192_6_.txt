RESULTS: Compared to placebo, the lipolotion with 0.5% coriander oil significantly reduced the UV-induced erythema, but it was not as effective as hydrocortisone. The skin tolerance of both coriander oil concentrations was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: The lipolotion containing coriander oil displayed a mild antiinflammatory effect in this study.
