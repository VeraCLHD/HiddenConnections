The older men with the highest intake of these micronutrients showed levels of sperm damage that were similar to those of the younger men. However, younger men (<44 years) did not benefit from higher intakes of the micronutrients surveyed. CONCLUSION(S): Men with higher dietary and supplement intake of certain micronutrients may produce sperm with less DNA damage, especially among older men.
