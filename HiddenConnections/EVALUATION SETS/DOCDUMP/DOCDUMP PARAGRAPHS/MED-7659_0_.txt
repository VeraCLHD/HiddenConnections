Abstract The current annual incidence of sudden cardiac death in the US is likely to be in the range of 180â€“250,000 per year. Coinciding with the decreased mortality from coronary artery disease, there is evidence pointing toward a significant decrease in rates of sudden cardiac death in the US during the second half of the twentieth century. However the alarming rise in prevalence of obesity and diabetes in the first decade of the new millennium both in the US and worldwide, would indicate that this favorable trend is unlikely to persist.
