Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of information about this critical master kinase, ranging from the composition of the TOR protein complex to its ability to act as an integrator of numerous extracellular signals. Unfortunately, this plethora of information has also raised numerous questions regarding TOR function. Currently, the prevailing view is that mammalian TOR (mTOR) exists in at least two molecular complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are largely defined by the presence of either RAPTOR or RICTOR.
