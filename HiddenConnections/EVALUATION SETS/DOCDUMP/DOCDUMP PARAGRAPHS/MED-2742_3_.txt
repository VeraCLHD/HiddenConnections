A dual mechanism for improvement in glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery has been proposed that appears to be weight loss independent. SUMMARY: Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities today that provide high rates of resolution of T2DM with improvements in insulin resistance and Î²-cell function. Novel bariatric procedures offer a unique opportunity to understand the pathophysiology of T2DM and to identify potential pharmacologic targets for effective T2DM treatments and a potential cure.
