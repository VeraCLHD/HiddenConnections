The Task Force on Research in Epidemiology and Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases gave new impetus to the concept of early intervention: Their highest priority in CVD prevention was "to prevent the development of CVD risk in the first place." Six issues follow: (1) the relation between "primordial prevention" of CVD and "prevention of the risk factors in the first place"; (2) the place of youth in context with older and younger age groups; (3) the importance of bridging institutional gaps between youth and adulthood; (4) the need to strengthen the scientific base linking the major risk factors (e.g., blood cholesterol concentration) with their determinants; (5) the value of rate of change in risk factors with age, and not only incidence of "treatable" levels of risk factors, as an outcome in assessing interventions; and (6) the role and appropriate design strategies for both observational and intervention studies. It is time for a radical expansion of our investment in preventing the risk factors in the first place.
