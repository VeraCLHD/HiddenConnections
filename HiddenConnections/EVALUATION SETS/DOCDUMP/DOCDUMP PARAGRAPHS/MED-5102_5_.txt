Anti-Gal IgE produced in some individuals causes allergies to meat and to the therapeutic monoclonal antibody cetuximab, all presenting α-gal epitopes. Aberrant expression of the α-gal epitope or of antigens mimicking it in humans may result in autoimmune processes, as in Graves' disease. α-Gal epitopes produced by Trypanosoma cruzi interact with anti-Gal and induce ‘autoimmune like’ inflammatory reactions in Chagas' disease.
