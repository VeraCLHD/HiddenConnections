Abstract Exogenous dietary putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) can increase growth rates of neonatal animals, including calves, chicks, and piglets, under nutritional stress. Turkey poults often have a high mortality rate and this may be due to poor initial feeding behavior and inadequate development of the intestinal tract. We conducted an experiment to determine the effect of dietary putrescine supplementation on growth performance and the role of dietary putrescine in prevention and recovery from a coccidial challenge.
