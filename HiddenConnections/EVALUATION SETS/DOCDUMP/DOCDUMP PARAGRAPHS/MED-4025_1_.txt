The diverse transient signals transduced by Ca2+ are mediated by intracellular Ca2+-binding proteins, also known as Ca2+ sensors. A key obstacle to studying many Ca2+-sensing proteins is the difficulty in identifying the numerous downstream target interactions that respond to Ca2+-induced conformational changes. Among a number of Ca2+ sensors in the eukaryotic cell, calmodulin (CaM) is the most widespread and the best studied.
