Additionally, in further supporting evidence, greater intakes of anthocyanidins and total flavonoids were associated with slower rates of cognitive decline (p-trends= 0.015 and 0.053, respectively, for the global score). Interpretation Higher intake of flavonoids, particularly from berries, appears to reduce rates of cognitive decline in older adults.
