Abstract BACKGROUND: Although vegan diets improve diabetes management, little is known about the nutrient profiles or diet quality of individuals with type 2 diabetes who adopt a vegan diet. OBJECTIVE: To assess the changes in nutrient intake and dietary quality among participants following a low-fat vegan diet or the 2003 American Diabetes Association dietary recommendations. DESIGN: A 22-week randomized, controlled clinical trial examining changes in nutrient intake and diet quality.
