METHODS: The Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health cohort study included women aged 30 to 49 years in 1991-1992. Participants completed a questionnaire and were followed-up through linkages to national registries until the end of 2006. Cox models were used to estimate adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for all-cause mortality and for cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.
