Cushing's syndrome in humans is the best evidence showing a link between hypercortisolemia and accumulation of central fat. The Hervey's hypothesis which suggests that fat cells take up and catabolize glucocorticoids is one of the possible regulatory effect that supports the adaptive role of visceral fat in response to stress. This is also supported by other evidence showing that abdominal obesity is associated with an increased cortisol clearance.
