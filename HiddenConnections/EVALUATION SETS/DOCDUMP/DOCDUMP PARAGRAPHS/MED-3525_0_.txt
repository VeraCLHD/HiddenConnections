Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is present in humans, plays an important role in oxidation of fatty acids and glucose. The purpose of this review is to highlight an important role for L-arginine in regulating BAT growth and development, thereby reducing obesity in mammals. RECENT FINDINGS: Dietary supplementation with L-arginine reduces white adipose tissue in genetically or diet-induced obese rats, obese pregnant sheep, and obese humans with type II diabetes.
