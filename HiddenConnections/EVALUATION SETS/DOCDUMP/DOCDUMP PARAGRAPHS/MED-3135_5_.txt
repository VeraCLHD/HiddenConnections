Syncope recurred in 4 (40%) of 10 patients aged >65 years versus only 1 (5%) of 19 patients aged < or =65 years, p=0.03. The non-responders had more episodes of impending syncope than responders (37+/-32 vs 3+/-4, p=0.001). Among 19 clinical variables, age in years was the only significant predictor of syncopal recurrence.
