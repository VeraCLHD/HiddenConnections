It causes ocular irritation or discomfort, and decreases functional vision, causing a dramatic deterioration in the quality of life. Although new treatments such as the P2Y2 agonist or cyclosporine eye drops have been developed and a certain level of patient satisfaction can now be obtained, no fundamental treatment has been developed.
