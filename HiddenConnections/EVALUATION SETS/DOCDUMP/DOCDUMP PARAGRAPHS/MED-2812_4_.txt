Infants were videotaped during vaccination done at the primary care physician's clinic. Videotapes were scored without knowledge of circumcision or treatment status by a research assistant who had been trained to measure infant facial action, cry duration, and visual analogue scale pain scores. FINDINGS: Birth characteristics and infant characteristics at the time of vaccination, including age and temperament scores, did not differ significantly among groups.
