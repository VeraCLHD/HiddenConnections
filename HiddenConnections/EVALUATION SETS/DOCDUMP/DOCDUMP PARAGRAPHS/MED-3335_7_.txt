During the 6 h after juice consumption, the antioxidant capacity of plasma increased significantly (P= 0·003) and there was a simultaneous increase in plasma and urinary phenolic metabolites (P< 0·05). There were significantly lower glucose and insulin peaks after ingestion of the FVPD compared with control (P= 0·019 and 0·003) and a trend towards increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation following FVPD consumption (P= 0·061). Overall, FVPD consumption significantly increased plasma vitamin C and total nitrate/nitrite concentrations, with a trend towards increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation.
