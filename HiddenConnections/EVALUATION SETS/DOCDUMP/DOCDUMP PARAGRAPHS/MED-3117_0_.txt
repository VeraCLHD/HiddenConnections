Abstract The effect of dietary calcium on fecal fatty acid excretion and serum lipids was tested in a randomized, single-blind metabolic study in 13 healthy men with moderate hypercholesterolemia. A low calcium base diet containing 34% of energy from fat, 13% from saturated fatty acids, 240 mg cholesterol/d and 410 mg Ca/d was compared with a fortified version in which calcium citrate malate was added to orange juice, (550 mg) muffins (750 mg), and two tablets (500 mg) for a total calcium intake of 2200 mg/d. Fecal collections (72 h, d 8, 9, 10) and blood from fasting subjects for lipids and lipoproteins (d 9, 10, 11) were obtained.
