The dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various favourable functions such as anti-inflammatory effects, improving endothelial function, controlling the blood pressure, and reducing hypertriglyceridemia and insulin insensitivity. According to some epidemiological studies, a lower prevalence of T2DM was found in populations consuming large amounts of seafood products, which are rich in n-3 PUFAs. However, the evidence on the relation between fish intake, dietary n-3 PUFAs, and risk of T2DM is controversial.
