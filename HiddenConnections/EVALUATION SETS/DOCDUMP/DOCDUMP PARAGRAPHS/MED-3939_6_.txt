A combined estimate of all 5 waves demonstrated similar results (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.71-0.75). Relative to those with the lowest FVI, those with the greatest FVI also had significantly lower odds of suffering from distress (OR: 0.87 95% CI: 0.78-0.98). These results were consistent across other waves.
