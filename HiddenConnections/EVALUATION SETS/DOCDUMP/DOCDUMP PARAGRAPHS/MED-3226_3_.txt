Experiments in cell culture and in vivo demonstrate that treatment with statins reduces production of Abeta. The authors discuss how cholesterol might modulate Abeta deposit formation. As neurons receive only small amounts of exogenous cholesterol, statins that efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier may reduce the amount of neuronal cholesterol below a critical level.
