The National Toxicology Program (NTP) recently conducted a two-year feeding cancer bioassay of 4-MEI in B6C3F(1) mice and F344/N rats. In rats, NTP found "equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity" in females based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and "no evidence of carcinogenic activity" in males. However, dose-related, statistically significant decreases in multiple tumors were observed in both male and female rats exposed to 4-MEI in the NTP bioassay.
