Here the results are reported of an attempt we made to overcome these drawbacks, using a diet supplying only natural foods of plant origin in definite proportions to give an essential amino acid supply satisfying the recommended dietary allowance. This is possible thanks to an appropriate cereal-legume mixture, supplying proteins complementary for essential amino acids. Additional positive features of this special vegan diet (SVD) are the high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, the absence of cholesterol, and the lower net acid production in comparison with a mixed diet.
