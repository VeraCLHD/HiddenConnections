Here we report results obtained concerning the accumulation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), mono- and non-ortho-polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the tissues of two species of Antarctic fish (Chionodraco hamatus and Trematomus bernacchii). The 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs) were also calculated to evaluate the potential risk of these compounds for the two species. In general, POP levels were higher in the tissues of T. bernacchii than in C. hamatus and the highest concentrations were found in the liver of both species.
