Based on month of blood sampling, an annual oscillation of 25OHD levels was seen, with levels being lower in spring and higher in late summer. Higher 25OHD levels were associated with better overall survival under multi-variate analysis (HR, 0.91: 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99, P = 0.027). Conclusions These results suggest that higher 25OHD levels at surgery may be associated with a better survival rate of patients with colorectal cancer.
