More recently, significant pain relief has been reported in clinical trials of painful diabetic neuropathy using agents such as the dual selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin, a specific modulator of the alpha(2)delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channels. A promising new anticonvulsant is lacosamide. In future, drug combinations might also include those aimed at symptomatic pain relief and quality of life on one hand and improvement or slowing the progression of the underlying neuropathic process on the other hand.
