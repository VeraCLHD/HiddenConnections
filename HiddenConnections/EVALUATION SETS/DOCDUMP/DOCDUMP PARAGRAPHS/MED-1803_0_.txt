Abstract The risk of leukemia among farmers was studied using records of death certificates from Nebraska, 1957--1974. Comparison of occupation, as recorded on the death certificate, for 1084 leukemia deaths and 2168 deaths from other causes, matched for age at death, year of death, county of residence, race, and sex, revealed an elevated risk of leukemia among farmers (odds ratio = 1.25). The risk was greatest among farmers born after 1900 and dying before age 66 (odds ratio = 1.83).
