Abstract Solar radiation contributes significantly to the status of serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 25-(OH)D3) in humans, even at the high latitudes of northern Norway. Thus, in late summer the serum concentration of calcidiol is roughly 50% larger than that in late winter, when the solar radiation in Norway contains too little ultraviolet radiation to induce any synthesis of vitamin D3 in human skin. This seems to influence the prognosis of colon cancer.
