BLV was searched in these cultures by immunocytochemistry and the polymerase chain reaction, the specificity of the latter confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and DNA sequencing. BLV was searched immunocytochemically in mammary tissue sections from 12 cows. RESULTS: Antigenic and/or molecular evidence of BLV was found in the cultured cells of 20 cows.
