Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the basic mechanisms of caloric intake reduction of bariatric surgery and its clinical and metabolic outcomes. To describe novel bariatric procedures, their effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and to explain the proposed mechanisms for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) resolution. RECENT FINDINGS: The effects of surgically induced weight loss on T2DM have elucidated in part the role of proximal and distal gastrointestinal bypass on insulin sensitivity.
