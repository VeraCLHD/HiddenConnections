Enzymes were immobilised on cobalt (II) phthalocyanine (CoPC) modified electrodes by entrapment in a photocrosslinkable polymer (PVA-AWP). The automated flow-based biosensor was successfully used to quantify three organophosphate pesticides (OPs) in milk samples. The OPs used were chlorpyriphos-oxon (CPO), ethyl paraoxon (EPOx) and malaoxon (MOx).
