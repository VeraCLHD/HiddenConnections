Abstract When the 'lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis' was proposed in 1982, it brought together several disparate experimental findings in hyperlipidemia and renal disease to suggest that concomitant hyperlipidemia and proteinuria would cause self-perpetuating renal disease once the initial glomerular insult was no longer present. This process would be analogous to atherosclerosis. Since 1982, increasing evidence has supported the hypothesis that lipid abnormalities contribute to both atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis.
