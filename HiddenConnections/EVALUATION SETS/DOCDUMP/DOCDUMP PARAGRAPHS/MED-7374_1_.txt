As such, to evaluate the true magnitude of this public health problem, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE using the MeSH headings, “death, sudden” OR the terms “sudden cardiac death” OR “sudden cardiac arrest” OR “cardiac arrest” OR “cardiac death” OR “sudden death” OR “arrhythmic death.” Study selection criteria included peer-reviewed publications of primary data used to estimate SCD incidence in the U.S. We used Web of Science®’s Cited Reference Search to evaluate the impact of each primary estimate on the medical literature by determining the number of times each “primary source” has been cited.
