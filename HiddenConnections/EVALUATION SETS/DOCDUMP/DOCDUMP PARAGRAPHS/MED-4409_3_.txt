Obstruction of these arteries causes ischemia in the lumbar spine and may result in back symptoms and disc degeneration. METHODS: MR aortography and cholesterol blood tests were performed on 51 patients with long-term lower back pain without specific findings (i.e., spinal or nerve root compression) in regular lumbar MR images. The patients ranged from 35 to 70 years of age (mean age, 56 years).
