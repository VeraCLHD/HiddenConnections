A treadmill desk is the combination of a standing desk and a treadmill that allow employees to work while walking at low speed. DESIGN AND METHODS: The hypothesis was that a 1-year intervention with treadmill desks is associated with an increase in employee daily physical activity (summation of all activity per minute) and a decrease in daily sedentary time (zero activity).
