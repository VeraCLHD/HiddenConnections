Abstract BACKGROUND: Determination of the effects of dietary modification and hyperlipidemic medications in the elderly (> sixty-five years of age) patient has not been significantly investigated to date despite knowledge that elevated cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels increase the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: Twenty-seven individuals were placed into one of three treatment groups and longitudinally followed up to examine the effects of diet and hyperlipidemic medications on TC and TG levels. Group 1 (n = 14) received neither dietary nor drug therapy.
