After 12 weeks, FMD had improved in the experimental group from a baseline of 4.23 + or - 0.13 to 4.65 + or - 0.15 mm, whereas in the control group it decreased from 4.62 + or - 0.16 to 4.48 + or - 0.17 mm. Changes were significantly different in favor of the experimental group (p <0.0001). Also, significant decreases occurred in C-reactive protein (from 2.07 + or - 0.57 to 1.6 + or - 0.43 mg/L, p = 0.03) and interleukin-6 (from 2.52 + or - 0.62 to 1.23 + or - 0.3 pg/ml, p = 0.02) after 12 weeks.
