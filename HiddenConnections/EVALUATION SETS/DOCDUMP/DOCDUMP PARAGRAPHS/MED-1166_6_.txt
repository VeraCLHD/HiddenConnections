Overall, SP improved OA-associated symptoms such as range of motion and several factors associated with pain and quality of life in comparison to MP.

Biochemical markers of cartilage metabolism further support the efficacy of SP in men as indicated by a significant increase in serum level of IGF-I and a significant decrease in serum level of YKL-40 compared to MP.
