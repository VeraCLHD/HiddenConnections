Significant gender*time*treatment interaction (p = 0.043) for total glutathione was found increasing at the end of the WM period in male but not changing in female. Total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio (p < 0.05) were lower in smokers. Hypercholesterolemics presented higher uric acid (p < 0.05) but no enzyme activities or substrate concentrations were different from those of normocholesterolemics.
