The AGE-diet, but not the CL-diet, produced distinct elevations in serum AGE levels in direct proportion to amount ingested (r = 0.8, P < 0.05): the area under the curve for serum (≈10% of ingested AGE) correlated directly with severity of KD; renal excretion of dietary AGE, although normally incomplete (only ≈30% of amount absorbed), in DM it correlated inversely with degree of albuminuria, and directly with creatinine clearance (r = 0.8, P < 0.05), reduced to <5% in DM with renal failure. Post-AGE-meal serum exhibited increased AGE-crosslinking activity (two times above baseline serum AGE, three times above negative control), which was inhibited by aminoguanidine. In conclusion, (i) the renal excretion of orally absorbed AGEs is markedly suppressed in diabetic nephropathy patients, (ii) daily influx of dietary AGEs includes glycotoxins that may constitute an added chronic risk for renal-vascular injury in DM, and (iii) dietary restriction of AGE food intake may greatly reduce the burden of AGEs in diabetic patients and possibly improve prognosis.
