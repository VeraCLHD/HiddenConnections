We screened 180 overweight and obese subjects for moderately increased C-reactive protein levels on 2 or more occasions, in the absence of any signs of acute infection. Twelve of the subjects met all inclusion criteria and were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design for 2 x 4 weeks (washout > or =4 weeks). Subjects ingested capsules containing 3 x 0.5 g of highly purified BDG or 3 x 0.5 g of placebo (waxy maize starch) daily.
