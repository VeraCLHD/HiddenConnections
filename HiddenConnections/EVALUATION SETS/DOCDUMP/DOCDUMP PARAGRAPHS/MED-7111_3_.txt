METHODS: Phone calls were made by a disguised shopper to 155 health food stores in the greater Phoenix area. The caller posed as a woman 8 weeks' pregnant asking for recommendations for treatment of nausea/vomiting and migraines. Responses and recommendations were recorded and then compared with current scientific evidence obtained during a search of the literature using MEDLINE (1966-September 2004) as to whether or not the supplements and the methods of their use during pregnancy were contraindicated.
