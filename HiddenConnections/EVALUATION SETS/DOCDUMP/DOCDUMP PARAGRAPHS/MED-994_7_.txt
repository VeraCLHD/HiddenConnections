This may partly be explained by elimination of the POPs among women reporting a history of breastfeeding. The proportion of very long-chain n-3 fatty acids in plasma were positively correlated with the pollutants: r=0.24 (PCB 28), r=0.33 (PCB 118), r=0.35 (PCB 138-180), r=0.29 (HCB), r=0.18 (β-HCH), r=0.34 (chlordane compounds), r=0.34 (p,p'-DDE), p≤0.005. Individuals consuming fatty Baltic fish≥1 time per months had 45% higher serum levels of PCB 118 compared with non-consumers.
