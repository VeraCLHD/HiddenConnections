RESULTS: Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores at baseline during all treatment conditions were positively correlated (r = .81, p < .01) with months of institutionalization, where participants with higher GDS scores experienced more time institutionalized. Scores on the GDS remained unchanged during the placebo and control conditions, but depression scores decreased significantly during the 10,000 lux treatment (pretest GDS M = 15 vs posttest GDS M = 11, p < .01). After the 10,000 lux treatment, 50% of the participants no longer scored in the depressed range.
