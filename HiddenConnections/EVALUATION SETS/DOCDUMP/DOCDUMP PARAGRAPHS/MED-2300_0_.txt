Abstract OBJECTIVES: We examined whether endothelial dysfunction occurs when acute hyperglycemia is induced by oral glucose loading. BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction has been shown to occur in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic hyperglycemia is implicated as a cause of endothelial dysfunction. However, in many patients with Type 2 DM and in those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), fasting blood glucose may be within normal limits, and hyperglycemia occurred only post-prandially.
