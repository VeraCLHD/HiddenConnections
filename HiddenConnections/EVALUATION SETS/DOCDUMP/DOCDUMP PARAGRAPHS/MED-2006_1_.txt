Treatment with BPA increased the triacylglycerol (TG) content of the cultures, increased the percentage of Oil Red O-staining cells in the cultures, and increased the levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and adipocyte-specific fatty acid binding protein (aP2) mRNAs. These findings indicate that BPA was able to accelerate terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. LY294002, a chemical inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), blocked completely the increasing effect of BPA on TG accumulation and expression of LPL and aP2 mRNAs.
