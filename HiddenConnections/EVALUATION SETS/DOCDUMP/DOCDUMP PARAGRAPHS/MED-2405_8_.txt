RESULTS: Nitrate naturally provided by the JTD was 18.8 mg/kg/bw/day, exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake by five times (ADI, 3.7 mg/kg/bw). Plasma and salivary levels of nitrate and nitrite were higher at the end of the JTD period. Diastolic BP decreased on average 4.5 mmHg during JTD compared to the control diet (P=0.0066) while systolic BP was not affected.
