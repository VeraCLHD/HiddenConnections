A crucial point in the argument is the pathogenesis of oedema, which is discussed in some detail. Although it is clearly multifactorial, with electrolyte disturbances--potassium deficiency and sodium retention--playing an important role, it is contended that the classical theory is essentially correct. On the dietary side, recent experimental work supports the earlier view that the development of oedema depends on a relative deficiency of protein with a relative excess of energy.
