Furthermore, we have shown that virgin camel urine significantly inhibited the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 at the mRNA and protein expression levels. Mechanistically, the ability of virgin camel urine to inhibit Cyp1a1 was strongly correlated with its ability to inhibit AhR-dependent luciferase activity and DNA binding as determined by EMSA, suggesting that AhR-dependent mechanism is involved. CONCLUSIONS: The present work provides the first evidence that camel urine but not that of bovine inhibits the TCDD-mediated toxic effect by inhibiting the expression of Cyp1a1, at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels through an AhR-dependent mechanism.
