Panelists adversely scored IT, CT, and OT for 2Â·5 and 5% tendon and CT and OT for 10% epimysium and gristle. CT and OT scores correlated with hydroxyproline content and Lee-Kramer peak shear force for uncooked steaks with added tendon, gristle and epimysium but not peri/endomysium. Acceptable products can be made when raw materials are free of tendons and contain only limited amounts of epimysium.
