The average intake and consumption frequency of gim in cases were lower than in controls. The daily intake of gim was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer (5th v. 1st quintile, OR, 0.48; 95 % CI, 0.27, 0.86; P for trend, 0.026) after adjustment for potential confounders. After stratification analysis was performed according to menopausal status, premenopausal women (5th v. 1st quintile, OR, 0.44; 95 % CI, 0.24, 0.80; P for trend, 0.007) and postmenopausal women (5th v. 1st quintile, OR, 0.32; 95 % CI, 0.13, 0.80; P for trend, 0.06) showed similar inverse associations between gim intake and the risk of breast cancer after an adjustment for potential confounders except dietary factors.
