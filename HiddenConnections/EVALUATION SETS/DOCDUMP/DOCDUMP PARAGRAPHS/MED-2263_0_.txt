Abstract Introduction Interventions designed to help couples recover sexual intimacy after prostatectomy have not been guided by a comprehensive conceptual model. Aim We examined a proposed biopsychosocial conceptual model of couplesâ€™ sexual recovery that included functional, psychological and relational aspects of sexuality, surgery-related sexual losses, and grief and mourning as recovery process. Methods We interviewed twenty couples pre-operatively and 3-months post-operatively.
