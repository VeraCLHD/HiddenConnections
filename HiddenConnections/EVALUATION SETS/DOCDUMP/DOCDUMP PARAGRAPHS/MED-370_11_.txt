CONCLUSIONS: Independent of BMI and other possible confounders, clinically assessed sciatica in men was associated with levels of atherogenic serum lipids. Pharmacologically treated hyperlipidemia was associated with sciatica in women. The findings are in accordance with the atherosclerosis-sciatica hypothesis.
