The mutagenic potency of sodium sorbate was less than one-tenth that of ethyl methanesulphonate, a potent inducer of mutation, when compared at an equitoxic level. Sorbic acid and its potassium salt induced chromosome aberrations, but only at the highest doses tested. These compounds also induced 1.2 times the control level of SCE, but neither compound induced 6-thioguanine-resistant mutations.
