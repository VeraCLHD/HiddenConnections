In the United States, the median urinary iodine (UI) was 168 microg/L in 2001-2002, well within the range of normal established by the World Health Organization (WHO), but whereas the UI of pregnant women (173 microg/L; 95% CI 75-229 microg/L) was within the range recommended by WHO (150-249 microg/L), the lower 95% CI was less than 150 microg/L. Therefore, until additional physiologic data are available to make a better judgment, the American Thyroid Association recommends that women receive 150 microg iodine supplements daily during pregnancy and lactation and that all prenatal vitamin/mineral preparations contain 150 microg of iodine.
