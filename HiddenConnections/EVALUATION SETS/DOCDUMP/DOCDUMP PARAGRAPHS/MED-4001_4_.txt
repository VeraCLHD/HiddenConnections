INTERVENTIONS: A diet containing lean meat (150 g/d) was compared with one with 290 g/d tofu in an isocaloric and isoprotein substitution. Both diet periods were 1 month, and fat intake was carefully controlled. RESULTS: Seven-day diet records showed the two diets were similar in energy, macronutrients and fibre.
