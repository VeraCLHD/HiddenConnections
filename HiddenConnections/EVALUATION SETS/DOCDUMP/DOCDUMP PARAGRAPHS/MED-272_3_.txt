The ad libitum consumption (Experiment 1) of raisins reduced pizza intake (p < 0.037), compared with water (26%), grapes (22%), and the mixed snack (15%). Cumulative energy intake (in kcal: snack + pizza) was lower after water and raisins than after either grapes or the mixed snack (p < 0.031). As a fixed-calorie (150 kcal) snack (Experiment 2), raisins reduced pizza intake, compared with water (âˆ¼11%, p = 0.005), and resulted in a cumulative intake similar to water; however, both grapes and the mixed snack resulted in higher cumulative intakes (p < 0.015).
