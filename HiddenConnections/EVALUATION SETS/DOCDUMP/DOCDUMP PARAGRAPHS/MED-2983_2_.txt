Each diet was served over a 5-day period, and subjects were allowed to eat to satiety. With equal acceptance ratings of the diets, satiety was reached on the diet low in energy density at a mean daily energy intake one-half that of the diet high in energy density (1570 versus 3000 kcal). Eating time was significantly longer on the diet low in energy density by an average of 33%/day.
