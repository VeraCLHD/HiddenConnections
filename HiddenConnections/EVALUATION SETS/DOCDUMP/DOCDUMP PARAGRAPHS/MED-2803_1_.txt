OBJECTIVE: We determined whether increased FV intake improves measures of immune function. DESIGN: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (The Ageing and Dietary Intervention Trial) in 83 healthy volunteers aged 65-85 y with low FV intakes (≤2 portions/d); 82 subjects completed the intervention. Participants were assigned to continue their normal diets or to consume ≥5 FV portions/d for 16 wk.
