Results Reducing salt by 3 gm/day is projected to result in 60,000–120,000 fewer new CHD cases, 32,000–66,000 fewer new strokes, 54,000–99,000 fewer myocardial infarctions, and 44,000–92,000 fewer deaths from any cause annually. All segments of the population would benefit, with blacks benefiting proportionately more, women benefiting particularly from stroke reduction, older adults from reductions in CHD events, and younger adults from lower mortality rates. The cardiovascular benefits from lower salt are on par with benefits from reducing tobacco, obesity, or cholesterol.
