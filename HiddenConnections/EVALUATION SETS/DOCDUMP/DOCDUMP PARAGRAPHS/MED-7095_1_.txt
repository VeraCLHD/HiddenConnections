Normal men and women consumed formula diets containing 20% of calories as soy protein or casein, 27% as fat and 53% as carbohydrate in 2 crossover studies. The dietary periods lasted for 31 days and were separated by a month-long interim period on self-chosen food. Following an initial reduction of plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels on all diets, the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations stabilized.
