Recent work has identified new players in this process. On the thymocyte side, several molecules have been newly implicated in the pathway from initial T-cell receptor signaling through to the final result: gene transcription and thymocyte apoptosis. In addition, several proapoptotic molecules have been found to be necessary for the death of self-reactive thymocytes.
