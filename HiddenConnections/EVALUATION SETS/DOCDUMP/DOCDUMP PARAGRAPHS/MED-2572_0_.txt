Abstract BACKGROUND: Preterm infants may be born with deficits of both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA), but studies on supplementation of DHA and AA for preterm infants are limited. METHODS: Preterm infants with a gestational age between 30 and 37 weeks who met all the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this double blind, randomized, comparative study. Infants over 2000 g body weight, over 32 weeks of gestation and in full feeding status would enter into the active intervention period of 6 months.
