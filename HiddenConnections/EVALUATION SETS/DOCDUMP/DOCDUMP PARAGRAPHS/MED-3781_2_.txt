Moreover, we investigated whether the associations were modified by intake of minerals (calcium, magnesium, and zinc) that decreases iron absorption. METHODS: The population-based prospective cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) included 36882 men, aged 45-79 years, who completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet and had no history of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer at baseline. RESULTS: During an 11.7 year follow-up, 678 fatal and 2593 nonfatal AMI events were registered.
