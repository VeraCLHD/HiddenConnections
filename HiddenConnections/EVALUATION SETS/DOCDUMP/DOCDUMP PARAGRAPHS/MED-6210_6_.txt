Shredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%.
