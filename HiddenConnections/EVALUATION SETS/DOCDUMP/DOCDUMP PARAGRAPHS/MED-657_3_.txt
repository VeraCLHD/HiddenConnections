Indomethacin in vitro enhanced the NK cell activity in both groups. There was, however, no significant difference between the NK cell activity in trained and untrained after exposure to indomethacin in vitro. Indomethacin-enhanced NK cell activity was 45.9% (range 24.4%-67.5%) in trained and 40.0% (range 23.9%-68.5%) in untrained (P = 0.138).
