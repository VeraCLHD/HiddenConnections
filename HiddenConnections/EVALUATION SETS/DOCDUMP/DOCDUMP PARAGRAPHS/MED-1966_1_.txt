MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicountry ecologic approach was used in multivariate regression analyses with prostate cancer mortality rates and dietary factors and solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation. Prostate cancer mortality rates for 32 predominantly Caucasian countries for the late 1990s were obtained from the World Health Organization. Dietary supply data were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization.
