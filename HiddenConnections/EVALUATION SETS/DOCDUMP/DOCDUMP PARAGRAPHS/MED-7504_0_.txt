Abstract BACKGROUND: Isothiocyanates (ITCs), hydrolysis products from glucosinolates, are a family of biologically active compounds originating from cruciferous vegetables. Many ITCs are assumed to have cancer preventive effects and to further evaluate these potential health effects, reliable biomarkers of ITC exposure are needed. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study we investigated the ability of urinary ITC excretion to reflect a low or high daily intake of cruciferous vegetables.
