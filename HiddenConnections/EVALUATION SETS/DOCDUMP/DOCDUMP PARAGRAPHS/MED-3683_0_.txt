Abstract The steady rise in Western obesity rates has been closely linked to significant increases in a multitude of accompanying health problems including Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD severity ranges from simple steatosis to acute steatohepatitis, but the molecular mechanisms controlling progression of this disease are poorly understood. Recent literature suggests that elevated free fatty acids (FFAs), especially saturated FFAs, may play an important role in lipotoxic mechanisms, both in experimental models and in NAFLD patients.
