The FVPD significantly increased plasma vitamin C (P= 0·002) and total nitrate/nitrite (P= 0·001) concentrations. There was a near significant time by treatment effect on ex vivo LDL oxidation (P= 0·068), with a longer lag phase after consuming the FVPD. During the 6 h after juice consumption, the antioxidant capacity of plasma increased significantly (P= 0·003) and there was a simultaneous increase in plasma and urinary phenolic metabolites (P< 0·05).
