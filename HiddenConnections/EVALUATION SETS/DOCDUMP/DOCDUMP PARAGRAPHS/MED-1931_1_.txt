This study found a more alkaline diet was positively associated with muscle mass in women suggesting a role for dietary acid-base load in muscle loss. INTRODUCTION: Conservation of skeletal muscle is important for preventing falls and fractures but age-related loss of muscle mass occurs even in healthy individuals. However, the mild metabolic acidosis associated with an acidogenic dietary acid-base load could influence loss of muscle mass.
