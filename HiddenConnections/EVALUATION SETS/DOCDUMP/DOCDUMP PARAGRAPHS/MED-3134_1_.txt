It is unclear whether prophylactic water drinking improves orthostatic tolerance in normal healthy adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-two healthy subjects, 18 to 42 years of age, with no history of syncope underwent head-up tilt-table testing at 60 degrees for 45 minutes or until presyncope or syncope occurred. In their initial test, participants were randomized to either 16 oz (473 mL) of water drinking 5 minutes before tilt-table testing or tilt-table testing alone, with the alternative in a second test on a different day.
