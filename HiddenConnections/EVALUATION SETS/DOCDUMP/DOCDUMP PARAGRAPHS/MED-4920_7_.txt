Blood harmane concentrations were quantified by a well-established high performance liquid chromatography method in 63 ET cases and 70 controls. A mean of approximately 6 years elapsed between the initial and this subsequent blood harmane determination. The mean log blood harmane concentration was significantly higher in cases than controls (0.30 ± 0.61 g−10/ml vs. 0.08 ± 0.55 g−10/ml), and the median value in cases was double that of controls: 0.22 g−10/ml vs. 0.11 g−10/ml.
