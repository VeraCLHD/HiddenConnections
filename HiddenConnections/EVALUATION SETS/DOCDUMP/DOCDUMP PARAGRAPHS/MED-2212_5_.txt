There also is evidence that despite the current heavy reliance on serum 25-OHD(3) concentration for the diagnosis of an individual's vitamin D status, local tissue vitamin D intoxication may be present in individuals with much lower serum 25-OHD(3) concentrations than are currently appreciated. Only rarely are the symptoms of local tissue vitamin D intoxication associated with vitamin D status or intake. An individual's serum 25-OHD(3) concentration may appear to be "low" for reasons totally independent of sunlight exposure or vitamin D intake.
