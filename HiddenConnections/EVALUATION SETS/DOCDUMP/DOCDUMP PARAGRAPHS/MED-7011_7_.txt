In LT97 adenoma cells, GSTM3, GSTT2, and MGST3 were induced, whereas GSTA2, GSTT2, and catalase (CAT) were elevated in primary colon cells. Colon cells of different stages of carcinogenesis differed in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms because butyrate increased protein levels of different GST isoforms and total GST enzyme activity in HT29 cells, whereas in LT97 cells, GST protein levels and activity were slightly reduced. Because butyrate increased histone acetylation and phosphorylation of ERK in HT29 cells, inhibition of histone deacetylases and the influence on MAPK signalling are possible mechanisms of GST activation by butyrate.
