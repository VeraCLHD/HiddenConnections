METHODS: Review of the scientific literature regarding three main players in tumourigenesis such as IGF-1, inflammation and p53, and centenarians. RESULTS: Centenarians appear to be characterised by low IGF-1-mediated responses and high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-beta, a condition that results in protection from cancer. Both inflammation and IGF-1 pathway converge on the tumour suppressor p53.
