Abstract BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence address the emerging role for copper in Alzheimer's disease (AD) for sustaining oxidative mechanisms. Studies indicate that peripheral markers of oxidative stress in AD patients could be informative about the pathophysiology of this brain condition. Here, we present a pilot study examining the efficacy of the copper-chelating agent d-penicillamine in reducing oxidative stress in AD patients.
