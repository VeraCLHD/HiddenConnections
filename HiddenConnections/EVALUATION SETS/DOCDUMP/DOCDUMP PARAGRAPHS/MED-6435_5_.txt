A questionnaire elicited information on symptoms, allergic diseases and medication. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with detectable IgE antibodies against aeroallergens increased consistently from the oldest to the youngest birth cohorts; chi2 trend=56.809, P<0.0001. Similar progression was not seen in sensitization to dietary allergens.
