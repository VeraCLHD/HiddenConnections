Nutritional status (as measured by body mass index, midarm circumference, and lean body mass and percent body fat), serum transferrin, cholesterol and albumin, and total lymphocyte count were similar on the two diets. The serum albumin level on both diets, however, was significantly higher on the two diets than during the prediet period. Blood urea nitrogen, urine urea nitrogen, protein catabolic rate, and 24-hour urine creatinine and phosphate were lower on the VPD than on the APD.
