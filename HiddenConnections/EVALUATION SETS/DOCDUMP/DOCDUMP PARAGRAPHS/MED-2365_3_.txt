Methods The relationship between baseline resting heart rate and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) was examined in 11,140 patients who participated in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study. Results A higher resting heart rate was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (fully adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 per 10 bpm, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08,1.21, p<0.001), cardiovascular death, and major cardiovascular outcomes without adjustment and after adjusting for age and sex and multiple co-variates. The increased risk associated with a higher baseline resting heart rate is most obvious in patients with previous macrovascular complications (fully adjusted HR for death 1.79 for upper [mean 91 bpm] v lowest [mean 58 bpm] fifth of resting heart rate in this sub-group, 95% CI 1.28,2.50, p<0.001).
