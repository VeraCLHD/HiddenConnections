On a molecular level, inhibition of GSK-3β expression or activity suppressed sodium palmitate-induced c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and Bax upregulation, whereas GSK-3β inhibition did not affect endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced activation of unfolded protein response. CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrated that saturated fatty acid sodium palmitate-induced lipoapoptosis in human liver L02 and HepG2 cells was regulated by GSK-3β activation, which led to JNK activation and Bax upregulation. This finding indicates that GSK-3β inhibition may be a potential therapeutic target to control NAFLD.
