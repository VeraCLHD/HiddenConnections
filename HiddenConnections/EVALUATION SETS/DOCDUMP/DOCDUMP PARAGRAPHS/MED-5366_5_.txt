No significant increases in skeletal or visceral abnormalities were seen. No significant increase in resorptions was seen in the Osborne-Mendel strain, but the Charles River strain at IBT showed a significant increase in litters with two or more resorptions after dams had been given 200 mg/kg at 0-19 days of gestation. The NCTR study on the Charles River strain also showed an increase in the same parameter for the same dose level and in addition showed a significant increase in the percentage of resorptions per litter.
