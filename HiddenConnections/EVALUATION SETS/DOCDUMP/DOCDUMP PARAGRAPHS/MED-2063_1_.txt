Bio-activation of the hop phytoestrogen isoxanthohumol to the potent oestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin was also investigated. The oestrogenic potency values for reference standards determined with the RCBA (17beta-oestradiol = 100%) were: methoxychlor 0.0025%, mestranol 1.3%, isoxanthohumol 0.001%, and for their potential respective metabolites were: bishydroxymethoxychlor 0.015%, 17alpha-ethynyl oestradiol 69% and 8-prenylnaringenin 0.4%. Incubation of methoxychlor and mestranol (10 microM) with microsomes prepared from the liver of rats treated with Aroclor 1254 significantly increased (p < 0.001) their oestrogenic potency from 0.0021 and 2.4% to 0.015 and 8.3%, respectively.
