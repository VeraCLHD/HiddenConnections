This study aimed at comparing the frequency of peripheral CD161(+) T cells in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and in healthy controls and at relating CD161 expression with symptom severity. METHODS: Forty-four patients with AR and 29 healthy non-allergic subjects were evaluated. CD161 expression was evaluated on CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells by double immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis.
