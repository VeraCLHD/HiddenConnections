We measured anti-Gal ABs of all isotypes and total immunoglobulin (Ig) content using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. For statistical evaluation of the longitudinal titers, we calculated confidence intervals for the slopes of a random intercept model, comparing variances between and within the probands. For group comparisons, we performed paired student t-tests and Pearson correlations.
