For cancers of colon and rectum combined, significant observations were a protective effect of high cruciferous vegetable intake (OR = 0.50, p less than 0.01) and a predisposing effect of a high meat/vegetable consumption ratio (OR = 1.77, p less than 0.05). Similar results were observed for colon cancer alone. For rectal cancer alone (only 71 cases), significant (p less than 0.05) protective effects were observed for high intakes of protein (OR = 0.61), fibre (OR = 0.46), beta-carotene (OR = 0.54), cruciferous vegetables (OR = 0.51) and total vegetables (OR = 0.51).
