This paper describes two orthogonal analytical methods suited for the detection of technological relevant transglutaminase concentrations (around 25 mg pure enzyme in 1 kg of product) in meat and meat products. The mass spectrometry-based approach relies on a previous digestion with Achromobacter lyticus protease and LC-MS/MS separation and detection. Sufficient selectivity was obtained by monitoring four different peptides.
