The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56-1.12; p = 0.19) for RCTs and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.59-1.16; p = 0.27) for cohort studies. On sensitivity analysis, no statistically significant difference was noted when stratified by study design or quality of the studies (as graded by Jadad or USPSTF scoring systems). CONCLUSION: This study does not suggest a major effect of fish/fish oil or n-3 fatty acids on the risk of AF.
