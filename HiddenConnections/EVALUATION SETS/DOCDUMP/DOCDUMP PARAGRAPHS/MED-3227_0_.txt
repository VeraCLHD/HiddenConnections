Abstract Importance Because deposition of cerebral beta amyloid (Aβ) appears to be a key initiating event in Alzheimer’s disease, factors associated with increased deposition are of great interest. Whether or not elevated serum cholesterol acts as such a factor is unknown. Objective To investigate the relationship between serum cholesterol levels and cerebral Aβ during life, early in the AD process.
