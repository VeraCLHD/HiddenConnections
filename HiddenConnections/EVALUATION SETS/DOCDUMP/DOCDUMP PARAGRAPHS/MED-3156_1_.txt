The disease is characterized by bleeding from inflamed colonic mucosa that mimics the bleeding of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, and it may culminate in stricture formation. We hypothesized that this condition is caused by the absence of luminal short-chain fatty acids, the preferred metabolic substrates of colonic epithelium. We studied four patients with diversion colitis, none of whom had evidence of Crohn's, idiopathic ulcerative, or infectious colitis.
