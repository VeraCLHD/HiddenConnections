Abstract BACKGROUND: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) captures a nationally representative probability sample from hospital emergency departments (EDs) in the United States. OBJECTIVE: Emergency department data from NEISS were analyzed to assess the magnitude and severity of adverse events attributable to food allergies. METHODS: Emergency department events describing food-related allergic symptomatology were identified from 34 participating EDs from August 1 to September 30, 2003.
