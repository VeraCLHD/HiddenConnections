Effects were adjusted in analysis for age, sex, Chinese dialect group and occupation. For cancers of colon and rectum combined, significant observations were a protective effect of high cruciferous vegetable intake (OR = 0.50, p less than 0.01) and a predisposing effect of a high meat/vegetable consumption ratio (OR = 1.77, p less than 0.05). Similar results were observed for colon cancer alone.
