Abstract Epidemiologic studies suggest that tea consumption decreases the risk for cardiovascular events. However, there has been no clinical report examining the effects of tea consumption on coronary circulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of black tea on coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE).
