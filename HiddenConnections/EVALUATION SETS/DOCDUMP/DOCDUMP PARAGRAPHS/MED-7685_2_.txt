MAIN RESULTS: One recent meta-analysis reported that isoflavone supplementation was associated with a 34% reduction in hot flashes, with increased efficacy as the baseline number of flashes and isoflavone dose increased. A second review concluded that consumption of at least 15 mg genistein, rather than total isoflavones, is responsible for the reduction in symptoms. Results of these two reviews are supported by most subsequent randomized controlled trials.
