Improvement during the 10,000 lux condition was positively correlated (r = .62, p < .05) to baseline GDS scores, where participants with higher GDS scores experienced greater improvement following the 10,000 lux treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that bright light treatment may be effective among institutionalized older adults, providing nonpharmacological intervention in the treatment of depression. Furthermore, the length of institutionalization may play an important role in determining the efficacy of bright light treatment for older adults in the nursing-home setting.
