Single-cell gel electrophoresis was employed to measure baseline levels of SSB and DNA susceptibility to oxidative damage, and to monitor the number of SSB over 4 h, in both unchallenged and H2O2-treated PBL. The enzymatic capacity for repair of different types of DNA oxidative lesions was also measured using two related cell-free assays. There was no evidence that any of the dietary supplementation regimens altered baseline levels of SSB, provided any direct antioxidant protection or altered DNA repair capacity, with two exceptions: the number of SSB following exposure to H2O2 decreased more rapidly in PBL from volunteers given the mixed carotene capsules and repair patch synthesis activity in PBL increased from volunteers given the cooked carrots.
