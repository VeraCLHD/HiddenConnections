METHODS: We reviewed the literature and performed new analyses of the mortality statistics from Greenland, Canada, and Alaska. FINDINGS: The evidence for a low mortality from IHD among the Inuit is fragile and rests on unreliable mortality statistics. Mortality from stroke, however, is higher among the Inuit than among other western populations.
