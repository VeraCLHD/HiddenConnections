We proposed to evaluate topical application of limonene to the breast as an alternative dosing strategy. Materials and Methods We conducted a mouse disposition study to determine whether limonene would be bio available in the mammary tissue after topical application. SKH-1 mice received topical or oral administration of limonene in the form of orange oil every day for 4 weeks.
