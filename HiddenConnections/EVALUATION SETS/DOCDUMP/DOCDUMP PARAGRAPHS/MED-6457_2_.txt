The drugs were added in binary combinations: Cis combined with Cur, and Cis combined with EGCG to the human ovarian A2780 and A2780(cisR) cancer cell lines, using five different sequences of administration: 0/0 h, 4/0 h, 0/4 h, 24/0 h and 0/24 h. The combination index (CI) was used to assess the combined action of the drugs. CIs <1, =1 and >1 indicated synergism, additiveness and antagonism respectively.
