For the strawberry extract, the inhibition of transport was non-competitive based on kinetic analysis, whereas the inhibition of cellular uptake was a mixed-type inhibition, with changes in both V(max) and apparent K(m) . The results in this assay show that some PPTs inhibit glucose transport from the intestinal lumen into cells and also the GLUT2-facilitated exit on the basolateral side.
