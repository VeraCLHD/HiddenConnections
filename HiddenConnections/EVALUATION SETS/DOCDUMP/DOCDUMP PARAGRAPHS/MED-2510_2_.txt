In contrast, gut endogenous proteins (e.g. cell proteins, mucin, serum albumin and digestive enzymes) are a consistent and significant potential source of peptides for the GIT. With up to 80% of gut endogenous proteins being digested in the GIT, it is possible that a wide range of peptides is generated, but until now the significance of the gut endogenous proteins as a source of bioactive peptides has not been considered. A hypothesis is promulgated that the gut endogenous proteins may have a hidden role as a consistent and quantitatively important source of bioactive peptides in the GIT.
