Abstract Hop, an essential ingredient in most beers, contains a number of prenylflavonoids, among which 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN) would be the most potent phytoestrogen currently known. Although a number of health effects are attributed to these compounds, only a few reports are available about the bioavailability of prenylflavonoids and the transformation potency of the intestinal microbial community. To test these transformations, four fecal samples were incubated with xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol (IX), and 8-PN.
