Abstract The effect of substituting soy for animal protein in mixed diets was determined in young men with mildly elevated plasma cholesterol, 218 to 307 mg/dl. The diets were low in cholesterol, 200 mg/day, with 13 to 16% of energy as protein, 30 to 35% as fat, and a polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio of 0.5. Of protein 65% was from either mixed animal proteins or isolated soy protein products made comparable by the addition of extracted animal fats.
