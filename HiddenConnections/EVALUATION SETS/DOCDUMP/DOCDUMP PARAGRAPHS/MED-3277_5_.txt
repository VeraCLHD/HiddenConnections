Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and dementia progression. RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up, 116 participants had progressed to dementia due to AD, while 223 remained in the MCI stage. Participants with moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis had a faster decline in cognition and function relative to participants without such stenosis.
