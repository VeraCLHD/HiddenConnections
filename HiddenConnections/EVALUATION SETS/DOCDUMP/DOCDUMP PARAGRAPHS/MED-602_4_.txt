The meals containing zero or 140 mg cholesterol generally elicited comparable postprandial plasma and lipoprotein lipid responses. The meals providing 280 or 710 mg cholesterol significantly increased postprandial plasma phospholipids and large TRL triglycerides and decreased plasma esterified cholesterol. The lipid composition of the large TRLs and the concentrations of the small TRL lipid components were not altered postprandially by cholesterol intake.
