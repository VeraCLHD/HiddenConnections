Based on the total FSFI score, 51% of women with hyperlipidemia had scores of 26 or less, indicating sexual dysfunction, as compared with 21% of women without hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001). Based on a more conservative analysis including women under the lower quartile of the distribution of FSFI score, 32% of women with hyperlipidemia had scores of 23 or less, as compared with 9% of women without hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis identified age, body mass index, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides as independent predictors of FSFI score.
