When stratified by race-ethnicity and race-ethnicity by sex, additional heterogeneity was noted, but results were difficult to interpret because of small sample sizes. Plasma phospholipid omega-3 concentrations showed a similar directionality of association with brachial artery measures observed for nonfried fish consumption, although statistical significance was not achieved in fully adjusted models. Conclusion: This study indicates that the association between nonfried fish intake and baseline brachial artery size varies by sex, with suggestive evidence of sex differences in the association between nonfried fish intake and FMD.
