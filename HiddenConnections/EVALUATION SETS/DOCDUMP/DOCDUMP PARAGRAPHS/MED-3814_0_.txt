Abstract The purpose of this study is to develop a method to estimate the hyperemic blood flow in a coronary artery using the sum of the distal lumen volumes in a swine animal model. The limitations of visually assessing coronary artery disease are well known. These limitations are particularly important in intermediate coronary lesions where it is difficult to determine whether a particular lesion is the cause of ischemia.
