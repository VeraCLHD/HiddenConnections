The purpose of this study was to use ambulatory monitoring technology to assess EE and time spent in moderate (3.0-6.0 METS), vigorous (6.0-9.0 METS), and very vigorous (>9.0 METS) intensities during an expedition to summit a 6170-m peak in Northern Pakistan. METHODS: Twelve men and 2 women were studied. Their EE was determined from galvanic skin response, heat flux, and biaxial accelerometry using a multisensor armband.
