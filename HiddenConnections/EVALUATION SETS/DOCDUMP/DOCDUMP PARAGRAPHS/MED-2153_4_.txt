CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiologic data justify the implementation of public health campaigns to raise public awareness of the risk of cortical cataract due to ocular UV-B exposure. Future researchers should be careful to avoid potential bias by measuring personal ocular UV exposure and by quantifying cataract carefully.
