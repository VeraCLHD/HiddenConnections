Abstract Green leafy vegetables, high in dietary nitrate, may contribute to cardiovascular health by augmenting nitric oxide status. The exogenous enterosalivary pathway of nitrate reduction to nitrite appears to be a critical determinant of the effects of nitrate. Our primary objective was to investigate the dose-response of nitrate intake on nitric oxide status and nitrate reduction in the mouth.
