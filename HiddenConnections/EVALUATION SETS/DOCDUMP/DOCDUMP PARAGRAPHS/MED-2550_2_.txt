Cases were newly diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease (N=154) from western Washington State in 2002–2008. Age- and sex-matched controls (N=173) were neurologically normal and unrelated to cases. Results Compared with never active or passive tobacco smokers, we observed similarly reduced Parkinson disease risks for ever passive smokers only (odds ratio=0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.16–0.73) as for ever active smokers (0.35, 0.17–0.73).
