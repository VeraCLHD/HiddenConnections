Abstract Anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV) are learned responses to chemotherapy that develop in up to 25% of patients by the fourth treatment cycle. Post-treatment nausea and emesis must occur before development of ANV can take place. Certain patient characteristics and other responses to chemotherapy can also be used to predict their occurrence.
