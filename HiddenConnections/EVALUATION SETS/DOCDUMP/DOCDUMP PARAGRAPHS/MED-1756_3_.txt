Design Data are from the HEAL (Health, Eating, Activity and Lifestyle) Study. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined serum concentrations of [25(OH)D] in 790 breast cancer survivors from western Washington, New Mexico and Los Angeles County. Cancer treatment data were obtained from SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) registries and medical records.
