We present data from the literature showing that appropriate use of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy has a positive effect on mortality, on numerous cardiovascular end points and on ED. Suggestions of when to refer the ED patient to an internist or cardiologist are provided. Identifying and treating cardiovascular risk factors may not only benefit the patient's ED, but it might also save the patient's life.
