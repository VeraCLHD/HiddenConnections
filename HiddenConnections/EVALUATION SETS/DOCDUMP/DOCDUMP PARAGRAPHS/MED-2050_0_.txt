Abstract OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of a hop extract (standardized at 100mug 8-prenylnaringenin per day) for relief of menopausal discomforts. METHODS: A 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted with 36 menopausal women. The participants were randomly allocated to either placebo or active treatment (hop extract) for a period of eight weeks after which treatments were switched for another eight weeks.
