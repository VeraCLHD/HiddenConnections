Brothy, vinegar, and residual particles were the only individual attributes rated significantly different (P < or = 0.05) due to treatment. Multivariate analyses indicated that all sensory attributes formed 2 dimensions that explained 57% of variation in the data. The low intensity values for texture attributes indicated possible negative consequences due to phosphates, salt, and acids when used with fully aged fillets.
