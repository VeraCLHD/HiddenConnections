The role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent mechanism was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the AhR-dependent luciferase reporter gene. RESULTS: All types of camel, but not bovine, urines differentially inhibited the induction of Cyp1a1 gene expression by TCDD, the most potent Cyp1a1 inducer and known carcinogenic chemical. Importantly, virgin camel urine showed the highest degree of inhibition at the activity level, followed by lactating and pregnant camel urines.
