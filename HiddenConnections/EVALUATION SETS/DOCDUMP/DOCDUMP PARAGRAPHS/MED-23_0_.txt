Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: This research was aimed at clarifying whether high dietary fiber intake has an impact on incidence and risk of stroke at a population level. METHODS: In 1647 unselected subjects, dietary fiber intake (DFI) was detected in a 12-year population-based study, using other dietary variables, anagraphics, biometrics, blood pressure, heart rate, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, uricaemia, fibrinogenaemia, erytrosedimentation rate, diabetes, insulin resistance, smoking, pulmonary disease and left ventricular hypertrophy as covariables. RESULTS: In adjusted Cox models, high DFI reduced the risk of stroke.
