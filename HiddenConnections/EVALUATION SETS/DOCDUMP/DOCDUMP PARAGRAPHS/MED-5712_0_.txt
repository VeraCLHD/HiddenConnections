Abstract Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased ROS generation, oxidative injury and obesity. To elucidate the relationship between nutrition and ROS generation, we have investigated the effect of glucose challenge on ROS generation by leucocytes, p47phox protein, a key protein in the enzyme NADPH oxidase and alpha-tocopherol levels. Blood samples were drawn from 14 normal subjects prior to, at 1, 2 and 3 h following ingestion of 75 g glucose.
