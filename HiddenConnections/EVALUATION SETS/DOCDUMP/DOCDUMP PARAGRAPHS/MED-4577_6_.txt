Results of plasma analyses of all compounds in 27 pre- and postmenopausal omnivorous and vegetarian women are presented for the first time. The most important findings are that the free+sulfate fraction is low for genistein (3.8% of total), but as much as 21-25% of enterolactone and enterodiol occurs in this fraction. A good correlation between plasma and urine values was found.
