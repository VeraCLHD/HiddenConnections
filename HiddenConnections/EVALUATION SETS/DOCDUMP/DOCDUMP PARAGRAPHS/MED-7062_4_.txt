In this context, we examined the influence of exogenously added garlic and onion on the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grains. Two representative cereals and pulses each were studied in both raw and cooked condition employing two levels of garlic (0.25 and 0.5 g/10 g of grain) and onion (1.5 and 3 g/10 g of grain). The enhancing effect of these two spices on iron bioaccessibility was generally evidenced in the case of both the cereals (9.4-65.9% increase) and pulses (9.9-73.3% increase) in both raw and cooked conditions.
