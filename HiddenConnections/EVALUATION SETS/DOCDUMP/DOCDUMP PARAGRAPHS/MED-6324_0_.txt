Abstract Background In recent decades, young men in some industrialized areas have reportedly experienced a decrease in semen quality. Objective We examined effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on sperm quality and reproductive hormones. Methods We investigated sperm quality and hormone concentrations in 39 sons (mean age, 22.5 years) born between 1977 and 1984 to mothers exposed to dioxin after the accident in Seveso, Italy (1976), and 58 comparisons (mean age, 24.6 years) born to mothers exposed only to background dioxin.
