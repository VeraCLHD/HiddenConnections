The aims of this study were to determine the acute effects of milk ingestion on serum urate concentrations and examine the mechanisms of these effects. METHODS: This was a short-term randomised controlled crossover trial of milk in 16 healthy male volunteers. The following products were tested (each 80 g protein): soy control, early season skim milk, late season skim milk (containing high concentrations of orotic acid, a naturally occurring uricosuric agent) and ultrafiltrated MPC 85 skim milk.
