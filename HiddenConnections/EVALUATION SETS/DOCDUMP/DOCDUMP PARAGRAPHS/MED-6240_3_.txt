This review considers recent evidence surrounding the role of inflammatory mediators in the development of hypersensitivity, along with the mediators and mechanisms of abdominal pain and discomfort once the acute inflammation has cleared. Recent data suggest that anatomic changes to mast cells-nerve fibers are necessary, but not sufficient to induce symptoms. It is now possible to estimate the risk of developing PI-FGID based on the presence and relative severity of different risk factors, including prolonged duration of initial illness, toxicity of infecting bacterial strain, smoking, mucosal markers of inflammation, female sex, depression, hypochondriasis, and adverse life events in the preceding 3 months.
