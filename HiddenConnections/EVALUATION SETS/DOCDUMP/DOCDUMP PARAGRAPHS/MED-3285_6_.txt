Intraneuronal lesions develop initially in the transentorhinal region, then spread in a predictable manner across other areas (stages I-VI). At stages I-II, neurofibrillary changes develop preferentially in the absence of amyloid deposits. A proportion of cases shows early development of amyloid deposits and/or intraneuronal changes.
