In this Review, we discuss research developments that are relevant to the lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis. We describe how inflammatory stress accompanying chronic kidney disease modifies lipid homeostasis by increasing cholesterol uptake mediated by lipoprotein receptors, inhibiting cholesterol efflux mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and impairing cholesterol synthesis in peripheral cells. As a result of these events, cholesterol relocates to and accumulates in renal, vascular, hepatic and possibly other tissues.
