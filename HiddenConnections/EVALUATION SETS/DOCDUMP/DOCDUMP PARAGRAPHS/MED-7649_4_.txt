Regardless of setting condition, microstructure of gel added with MTGase was finer with a smaller void compared with that of gel without MTGase. Therefore, setting temperature affected the property of gels added with MTGase. Gel properties of mince obtained from lizardfish stored in ice for different times (0 to 10 d) with and without MTGase at a level 0.6 units/g were determined.
