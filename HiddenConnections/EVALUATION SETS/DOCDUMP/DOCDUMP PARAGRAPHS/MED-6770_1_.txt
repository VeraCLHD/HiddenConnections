The total PAH concentration of BBQ restaurants (58.81 ± 23.89 μg m(-3)) was significantly higher than that of Chinese (20.99 ± 13.67 μg m(-3)) and Western (21.47 ± 11.44 μg m(-3)) restaurants. The total benzo[a]pyrene potency equivalent (B[a]P(eq)) concentrations, however, were highest in Chinese restaurants (1.82 ± 2.24 μg m(-3)), followed by Western (0.86 ± 1.43 μg m(-3), p<0.01) and BBQ-type restaurants (0.59 ± 0.55 μg m(-3), p<0.01). We further developed a probabilistic risk model to assess the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people exposed to carcinogenic PAHs.
