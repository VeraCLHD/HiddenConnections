Annual solar UV-B dose data were obtained from European ground stations and used to estimate values elsewhere. Linear and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted for all 32 countries as well as the 20 European countries. RESULTS: The strongest risk factor for prostate cancer mortality was animal products, with the nonfat portion of milk and alcohol being somewhat weaker; the strongest risk reduction factors were onions, other protective vegetable products (excluding alcohol, oils, and sweeteners), and solar UV-B radiation.
