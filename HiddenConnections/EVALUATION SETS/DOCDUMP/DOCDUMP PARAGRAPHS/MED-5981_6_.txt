RESULTS: In 179 patients, retinal photographs and brain MRI were performed. Of the 108 patients with MR signs of SVD, 92% had at least one retinal vascular abnormality; of the 71 patients without SVD, 77% had retinal pathology (p < 0.01). All types of retinal vascular pathology occurred more frequently in patients with SVD, but only retinal arterial narrowing and sclerosis differed significantly.
