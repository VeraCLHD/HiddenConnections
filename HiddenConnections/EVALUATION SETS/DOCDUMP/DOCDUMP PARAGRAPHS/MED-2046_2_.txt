The responses were determined by means of a modified Kupperman index (KI) and a patients' questionnaire. RESULTS: All groups, including placebo, showed a significant reduction of the KI both after 6 weeks and after 12 weeks. The hop extract at 100 microg 8-PN was significantly superior to placebo after 6 weeks (P=0.023) but not after 12 weeks (P=0.086).
