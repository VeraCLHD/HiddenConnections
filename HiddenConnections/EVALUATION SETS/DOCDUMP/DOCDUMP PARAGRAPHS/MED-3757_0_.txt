Abstract Migraine is considered as a neurological disorder with little convincing evidence of the involvement of some vascular phenomenon. Recent understanding of the mechanisms behind migraine pain generation and perception have considerably helped the development of modern migraine drugs. Most migraine drugs in use, i.e., ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, iprazochrome, pizotifen and diazepam; and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (i.e. aspirin, paracetamol, persantin, etc.) have side-effects and are prescribed with caution for a limited duration.
