Abstract BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether diets with a high dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) can modify oxidative stress, low-grade inflammation, or liver dysfunction, all of which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of high- and low-TAC (HT and LT, respectively) diets on markers of antioxidant status, systemic inflammation, and liver dysfunction. DESIGN: In a crossover intervention, 33 healthy adults (19 men, 14 women) received the HT and LT diets for 2 wk each.
