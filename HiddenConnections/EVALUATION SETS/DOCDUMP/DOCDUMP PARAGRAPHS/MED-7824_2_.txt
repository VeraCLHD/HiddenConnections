METHOD: A literature review of peer-reviewed articles on observational and interventional studies was conducted to include green tea, its extract or its purified polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Electronic databases searched included PubMed (1966-2009) and the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2008). RESULTS: Observational studies are inconclusive on the benefits of habitual consumption of green tea in the prevention of most cancers.
