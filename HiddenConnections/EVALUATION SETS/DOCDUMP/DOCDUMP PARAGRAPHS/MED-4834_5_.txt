The extracts were evaluated for antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic activity in vitro at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The antiplatelet activity was assessed by platelet aggregation inhibition; anticoagulant activity was measured by the prothrombin time (PT), diluted prothrombin time (dPT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), kaolin clotting time (KCT), and thrombin time. The fibrinolytic effect was determined with the euglobin clot lysis time and fibrin plate methods.
