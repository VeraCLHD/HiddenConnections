Epidemiological studies in adult dialysis patients demonstrate a significant and independent association between raised P and mortality. Importantly, raised P is associated with cardiovascular changes even in pre-dialysis CKD, and also in subjects with normal renal function but high P. All P binders can effectively reduce serum P, and this decrease is linked to improved survival. Raised serum P triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which has the beneficial effect of increasing P excretion in early CKD, but is increased several 1,000-fold in dialysis, and may be an independent cardiovascular risk factor.
