In a Phase III, 76-week study, the rates of response, as measured using SRI, at week 52 were 42.8% and 46.5% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 35.3% with placebo (P = NS and P < 0.001); at 76 weeks, response rates were 42.1% and 41.4% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 33.8% with placebo (P < 0.05 and P = NS). The tolerability data from these studies did not suggest any overall differences between belimumab and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings from the present review, belimumab appears to be efficacious and generally well-tolerated and in the treatment of SLE other than lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus.
