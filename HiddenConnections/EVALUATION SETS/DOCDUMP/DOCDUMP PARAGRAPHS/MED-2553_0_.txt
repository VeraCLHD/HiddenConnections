Abstract Myosmine is a minor tobacco alkaloid with widespread occurrence in the human diet. Myosmine is genotoxic in human cells and is readily nitrosated and peroxidated yielding reactive intermediates with carcinogenic potential. For biomonitoring of short-term and long-term exposure, analytical methods were established for determination of myosmine together with nicotine and cotinine in plasma, saliva and toenail by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
