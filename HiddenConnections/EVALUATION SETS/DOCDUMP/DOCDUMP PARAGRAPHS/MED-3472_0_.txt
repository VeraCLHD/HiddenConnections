Abstract BACKGROUND: The association between habitual caffeine intake with incident atrial fibrillation (AF) was unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between chronic exposure of caffeine and the risk of AF and to evaluate the potential dose-response relation. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to November 2013 and references of relevant retrieved articles.
