Antigenic evidence of BLV was found in tissue sections from 10 cows, indicating virus expression in vivo. Simultaneous detection of BLV p24 and cytokeratins, localized antigen expression to the mammary epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These indications of BLV in mammary epithelial cells in vivo suggest that BLV is capable of infecting and expressing antigen in glandular epithelium in vivo and has a broader tissue tropism than was previously thought.
