The compounds found in relatively large amounts (10-1000 times more than estrogens) in urine are modified by intestinal bacteria from plant lignans and phytoestrogens, which are present in fiber-rich food such as grain and beans. They bind with low affinity to estrogen receptors and preliminary results suggest that they may induce production of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in the liver and in this way may influence sex hormone metabolism and biological effects. Five compounds, the lignans enterolactone (Enl), enterodiol (End) and the isoflavonic phytoestrogen metabolites daidzein (Da), equol (Eq) and O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma) were measured in urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (selected ion monitoring) using deuterated internal standards in 5 groups of women (total number 53).
