Abstract OBJECTIVE: There is a widely held view that, due to high fat content, snacking on nuts will lead to weight gain, ultimately causing unhealthy changes in lipid profiles. This study is designed to study the effects of pistachio snack consumption on body weight and lipid levels in obese participants under real-world conditions. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to consume 1 of 2 isocaloric weight reduction diets for 12Â weeks, with each providing 500 cal per day less than resting metabolic rate.
