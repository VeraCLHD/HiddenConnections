No associations were observed with consumption of processed meat, chicken, fish, eggs, cholesterol, fats or protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that greater consumption of total red and fresh red meat and dairy products might influence circulating concentrations of SHBG and estradiol, respectively. Confirmation and further investigation is required.
