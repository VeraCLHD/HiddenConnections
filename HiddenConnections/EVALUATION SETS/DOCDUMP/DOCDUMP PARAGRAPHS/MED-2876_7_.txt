RESULTS: The average age (SD) was 70.6 (7.1) years; eGFR 23.5 (14.2) ml/min/1.73 m(2). Analysis using extended Cox models for the NEAP groups adjusted for baseline characteristics (referring to group 1 showing the lowest NEAP) showed that high NEAP was associated with a high risk of CKD progression; group 2, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 3.930 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.914, 8.072); group 3, adjusted HR 4.740 (95% CI 2.196, 10.288); group 4, adjusted HR 4.303 (95% CI 2.103, 8.805). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for baseline characteristics showed that the occurrence of hypoalbuminemia or hyperkalemia was associated with low serum bicarbonate level and the presence of complications at baseline, but not with NEAP.
