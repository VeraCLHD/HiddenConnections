RESULTS: During an 11.7 years follow-up, 3097 incident cases of stroke, including 2482 cerebral infarctions and 450 intracerebral hemorrhages, were registered. The hazard ratios of total stroke and cerebral infarction for the highest compared with the lowest quintiles of heme iron intake were 1.16 (95% CI, 1.03-1.31; P trend=0.037) and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.00-1.31; P trend=0.089), respectively. The incidence rates of total stroke per 10 000 person-years were 72.6 in the lowest quintile and 84.4 in the highest.
