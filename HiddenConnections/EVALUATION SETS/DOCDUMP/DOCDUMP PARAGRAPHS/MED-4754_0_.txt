Abstract Diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy extract an enormous toll on patients with diabetes and an enormous burden on the health care system. With aggressive control of glycemia and blood pressure, coupled with aggressive use of laser photocoagulation and treatment of microalbuminuria, these problems can largely be eliminated. In the future, specific interventions may emerge that will allow interdiction of the pathophysiologic processes that lead to initiation and progression of these microvascular complications.
