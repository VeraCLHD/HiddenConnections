The mean clinical attachment loss was positively correlated with serum LDL cholesterol (P < 0.01) and gingival index (P<0.05). The frequency of persons with pathologic values of LDL cholesterol was significantly higher in periodontitis patients compared with that of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that high serum LDL cholesterol may be associated with periodontitis in healthy people.
