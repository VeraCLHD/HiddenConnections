A significant relationship between SIRT1 levels and global cognition scores proximate to death was also found (r2 = +0.09; p = 0.049). In contrast, cortical SIRT1 levels remained unchanged in a triple-transgenic animal model of AD. Collectively, our results indicate that loss of SIRT1 is closely associated with the accumulation of AÎ² and tau in the cerebral cortex of patients with AD.
