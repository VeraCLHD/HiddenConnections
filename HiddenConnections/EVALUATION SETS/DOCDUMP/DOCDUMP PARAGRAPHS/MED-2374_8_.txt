In addition to diabetes, and digoxin as well as pulmonary and renal disease, LVSD was also independently associated with SCD (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.11â€“2.87, p=0.02). Conclusion Contrary to expectations, the significant relationship between increased resting HR and SCD persisted even after adjustment for LVSD and rate-modulating drugs. These findings suggest a potential role for additional, novel interventions/therapies that modulate autonomic tone.
