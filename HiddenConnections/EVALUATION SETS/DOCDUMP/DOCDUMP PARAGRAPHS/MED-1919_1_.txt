Data from the limited research studies available suggest that the EAR and RDA might be greater than the assumed 0.66 and 0.80 g protein x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1), respectively. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the effect of age on the EAR and RDA for protein. DESIGN: Twenty-three younger (age: 21-46 y; 11 men, 12 women) and 19 older (age: 63-81 y; 8 men, 11 women) persons completed three 18-d trials with protein intakes of 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 g protein x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1).
