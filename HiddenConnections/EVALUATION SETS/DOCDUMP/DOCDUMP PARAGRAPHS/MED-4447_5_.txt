At the same concentrations as strawberry inhibits platelet aggregation, it significantly decreased sP-selectin, sCD40L, RANTES, and IL-1Î² levels. The strawberry may exert significant protective effects on thromboembolic-related disorders by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Also, this suggests that antithrombotic activity may have novel anti-inflammatory effects.
