Abstract Despite its antioxidant capacity and well-known health benefits, yerba mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis) has been shown to possess some genotoxic and mutagenic activities and to increase incidence of some types of cancer. The aim of this study was to estimate the cyto- and genotoxicity of mate tea in human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro. We found that yerba mate extract induced a concentration-dependent, statistically significant increase in the level of apoptotic and necrotic cells and a decrease in the nuclear division index (NDI).
