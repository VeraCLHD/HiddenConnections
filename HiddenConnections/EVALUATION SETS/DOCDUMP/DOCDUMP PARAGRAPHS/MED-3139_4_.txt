Leg-crossing significantly increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) in all 3 groups (8.0+/-5.8 mmHg in group I, 7.0+/-8.5 mmHg in group II, 8.7+/-5.7 mmHg in group III; p < 0.05), but not diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Squatting significantly increased SBP and DBP in all 3 groups (7.1 +/-5.1, 4.6+/-5.8 mmHg in group I, 7.8+/-5.9, 4.3+/-4.7 mmHg in group II, 6.5+/-5.0, 3.7+/-3.9 mmHg in group III; p < 0.05). However, handgrip did not exert any significant influence on the hemodynamics in any group nor did heart rate change significantly during the physical maneuvers in any group.
