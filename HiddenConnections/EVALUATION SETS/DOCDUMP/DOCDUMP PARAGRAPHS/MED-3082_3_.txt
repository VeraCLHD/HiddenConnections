Peppermint (Mentha piperita) is usually taken after a meal for its ability to reduce indigestion and colonic spasms by reducing the gastrocolic reflex. It is a naturally occurring hybrid cross between water mint (M. aquatica) and spearmint (M. spicata) and is best known for its role as a popular flavouring agent. Less well recognised is peppermint's potential role in the management of numerous other medical conditions including certain procedures, e.g. colonoscopy.
