Intakes of energy, monounsaturated fatty acids, n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n6 PUFAs, and soluble fiber had significant associations with the stool bacterial numbers (e.g., increased energy intake was associated with reduced numbers of Bacteroides spp.) . In addition, co-twins with identical energy intake had more similar numbers and DGGE-profile diversities of Bacteroides spp.
