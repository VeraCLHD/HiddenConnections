Abstract Increments in dietary protein intake can increase glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in humans, and the glomerular hyperfiltration induced by high protein intake has been incriminated in the progression of glomerulosclerosis related to age and a number of renal diseases. GFR (as 51Cr-EDTA clearance) was measured in 18 vegans, 16 lactovegetarians and 18 omnivorous control subjects, matched for age. Omnivores ate significantly more total protein and protein of animal origin than the other two groups.
