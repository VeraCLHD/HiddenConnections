Recent literature suggests that elevated free fatty acids (FFAs), especially saturated FFAs, may play an important role in lipotoxic mechanisms, both in experimental models and in NAFLD patients. This review highlights important cellular pathways involved in hepatic lipotoxicity and how the degree of intrahepatic lipid saturation controls cell fate in response to an elevated FFA load. Relevant cellular processes that have been causally linked to lipid-induced apoptosis, known as lipoapoptosis, include endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling.
