A lifestyle score was calculated by adding the number of high-risk practices (smoking, consuming > or = 22.8 g alcohol/d, walking < 1 hr/d, body mass index < 18.5 or > or = 30.0). Cox regression was used to estimate relative risk (RR) of mortality according to the lifestyle score, with adjustment for age, education, marital status, past history of diseases, and dietary variables. During 11 years of follow-up, 1,200 subjects had died.
