Twenty-seven participants with coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or risk factors for CAD (nonsmokers, 14 men; mean age 56 years) were enrolled in the experimental group and asked to make changes in diet (10% calories from fat, plant based), engage in moderate exercise (3 hours/week), and practice stress management (1 hour/day). Twenty historically (age, gender, CAD, and CAD risk factors) matched participants were enrolled in the control group with usual standard of care. At baseline endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was performed in the 2 groups.
