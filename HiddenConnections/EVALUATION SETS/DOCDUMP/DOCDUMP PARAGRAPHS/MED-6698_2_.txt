METHODS: In a double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One patient in each group was withdrawn.
