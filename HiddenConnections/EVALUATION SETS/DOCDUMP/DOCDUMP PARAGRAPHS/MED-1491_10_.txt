Clinical studies also indicate that cisapride might be effective in the treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, postoperative ileus, peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. Further clinical studies are warranted to define the role of cisapride in these conditions. The dosage of cisapride ranges from 5mg 3 times daily to 20mg twice daily.
