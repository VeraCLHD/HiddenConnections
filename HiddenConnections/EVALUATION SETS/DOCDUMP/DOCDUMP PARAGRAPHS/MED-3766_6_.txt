The patient underwent a systemic work-up for gnathostomiasis, including imaging, and no other abnormalities were found. She completed a 3-week course of albendazole and has remained asymptomatic since the biopsy of her abdominal lesion. Although gnathostomiasis is often a systemic illness, this patient did well with apparently only localized cutaneous disease.
