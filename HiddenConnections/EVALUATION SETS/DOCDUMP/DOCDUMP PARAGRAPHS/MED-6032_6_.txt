Elevated SMRs that were not statistically significant were observed for cancers of the liver, nasopharynx, myelofibrosis, and myeloma. New sites observed to be significantly in excess in this study were cancers of the cervix and penis. CONCLUSION: This large study provides evidence that a human group with high exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses has increased risk of dying from several cancers.
