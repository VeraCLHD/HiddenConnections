Twenty-four hour-aMT6s total amount (rho=-0.68, p<0.001), aMT6s nighttime excretion (rho=-0.69, p<0.001), aMT6s morning excretion (rho=-0.66, p<0.001) and evening excretion (r=-0.26, p=0.023) were negatively associated with age, whereas daytime excretion (r=-0.17, p=0.15) was not. The intra-subject night-day ratio varied up to 10.5 (mean 6.0) in young subjects (aged 20-35) and up to 5.4 (mean 2.8) in older individuals (age>65). The total amount of 24 h-aMT6s (range 7.5-58 microg) as well as the amount of aMT6s excreted during the nighttime period (range 327-6.074 ng/h) varied as much as 20-fold between individuals.
