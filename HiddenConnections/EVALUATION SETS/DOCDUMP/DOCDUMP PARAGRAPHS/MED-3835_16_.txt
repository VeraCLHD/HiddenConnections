Participants with erosive oesophagitis had significantly higher daily intakes of total fat and protein than those without it (p<0.05). Conclusions: In this cross sectional study, high dietary fat intake was associated with an increased risk of GORD symptoms and erosive oesophagitis while high fibre intake correlated with a reduced risk of GORD symptoms. It is unclear if the effects of dietary fat are independent of obesity.
