Further analyses that sequentially removed individual recommendations least associated with reduced risk suggested that this reduction is due to meeting recommendations related to body fatness, plant foods and alcohol (HR for meeting vs. not meeting these three recommendations: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.25â€“0.58; Ptrend <0.001). Conclusions Meeting the WCRF/AICR cancer prevention recommendations, specifically those related to alcohol, body fatness and plant foods, is associated with reduced post-menopausal breast cancer incidence. Impact Increased adherence to the WCRF/AICR cancer prevention recommendations could substantially reduce post-menopausal breast cancer risk in US women.
