Employing the mRNA display technique, we have scanned the human proteome for CaM-binding proteins and have identified and characterized a large number of both known and previously uncharacterized proteins that interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The interactions of several identified proteins with Ca2+/CaM were confirmed by using pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. Many of the CaM-binding proteins identified belong to protein families such as the DEAD/H box proteins, ribosomal proteins, proteasome 26S subunits, and deubiquitinating enzymes, suggesting the possible involvement of Ca2+/CaM in different signaling pathways.
