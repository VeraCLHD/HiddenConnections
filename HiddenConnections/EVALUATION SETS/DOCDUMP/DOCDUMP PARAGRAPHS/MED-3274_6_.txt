Others were classified as having no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5%), or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8%). We compared MMSE progression over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression model. RESULTS: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups.
