We further developed a probabilistic risk model to assess the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people exposed to carcinogenic PAHs. Because the exhaust stack directly affected the back-door neighbors of these restaurants, we were concerned with the real exposure of groups near the exhaust stack outlets of these restaurants. The ILCRs for total exposure of the neighbors (inhalation+dermal contact+ingestion) were 2.6-31.3, 1.5-14.8, and 1.3-12.2 Ã— 10(-6) in Chinese, Western, and BBQ restaurants, respectively.
