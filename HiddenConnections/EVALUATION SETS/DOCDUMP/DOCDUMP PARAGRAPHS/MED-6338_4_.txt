Similarly, the mean numbers of SCE per cell were statistically higher (P=0.025) in the exposed group (6.2) in comparison with the control group (5.8). In the case of micronuclei analysis, no significant (P=0,06) difference between both groups was found, but these data should be cautiously interpreted since an increase in the frequencies of MN was found for radiation workers (3.0 MN/100 cells), compared to the control group (2.6 MN/100 cells) and this increase occur in parallel to CA and SCE frequencies. The difference between the results could be explained by the nature of CA and MN generation.
