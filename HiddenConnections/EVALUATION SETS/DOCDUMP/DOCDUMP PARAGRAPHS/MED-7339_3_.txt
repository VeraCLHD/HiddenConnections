Among the participants, 355 twins were diagnosed with dementia. Among these, 81 twin pairs were discordant for dementia (50 discordant for AD). Data were analyzed with logistic regression for the entire sample using generalized estimating equations to adjust for relatedness of twins, and with conditional logistic regression for the co-twin control design.
