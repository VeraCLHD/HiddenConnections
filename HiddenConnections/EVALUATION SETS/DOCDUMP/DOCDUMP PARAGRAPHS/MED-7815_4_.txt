It was also found that the infusion of hibiscus could supply greater amounts of iron (111+/-5 microg/g total, 40.5% leached) and copper (5.9+/-0.3 microg/g total, 93.4% leached) as compared to other infusions. Moreover, it was found that the percentage of element leached to the infusion was strongly related to the tannins content in the beverage (correlation coefficients > 0.82 with the exception for nickel); for lower tannins level, better leaching was observed.
