The meat of kids fed PSP15 showed higher a* and C* values (P<0.01) and lower H* and b* values (P<0.001), than kids fed with Control diet. The results of this experiment indicated that replacing barley and corn grains with PSP in the diet may improve the color and lipid stability of kid meat. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
