Mean levels of 75 to 110 nmol/l were reached in most RCTs with 1800 IU to 4000 IU vitamin D/d without risk. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that mean serum 25(OH)D levels of about 75 to 110 nmol/l provide optimal benefits for all investigated endpoints without increasing health risks. These levels can be best obtained with oral doses in the range of 1800 to 4000 IU vitamin D/d; further work is needed, including subject and environment factors, to better define the doses that will achieve optimal blood levels in the large majority of the population.
