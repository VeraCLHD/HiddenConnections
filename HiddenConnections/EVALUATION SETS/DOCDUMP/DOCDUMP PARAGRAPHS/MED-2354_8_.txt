Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) exhibited lower adherence to MD (29.3 ± 3.2 vs. 34.1 ± 4.4, p = 0.004) compared to those with simple fatty liver. Logistic regression analysis revealed that one unit increase in the MedDietScore was associated with 36% lower likelihood of having NASH (odds ratio: 0.64, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.92), after adjusting for sex and abdominal fat level. No difference in the MedDietScore was observed between patients and controls.
