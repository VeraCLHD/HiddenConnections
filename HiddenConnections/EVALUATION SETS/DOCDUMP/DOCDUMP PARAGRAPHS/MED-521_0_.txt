Abstract OBJECTIVE: Since black tea contains high levels of manganese (Mn), we investigated the relationship between dietary Mn intake, circulating Mn levels and leucocyte expression of two Mn-dependent enzymes in tea drinkers and non-tea drinkers. DESIGN: We assessed Mn intakes (food frequency questionnaire), fasting whole blood and plasma Mn levels, and quantitative expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cell Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and cytosolic aminopeptidase-P (cAP-P). SETTING AND SUBJECTS: In total, 24 tea drinkers (> or = 1 l black tea/day) and 28 non-tea drinkers were recruited from the staff and students of King's College London by circular email.
