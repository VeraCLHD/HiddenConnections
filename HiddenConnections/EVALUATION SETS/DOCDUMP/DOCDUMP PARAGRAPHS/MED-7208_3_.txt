METHODS: We evaluated the effect of sulforaphane alone or in combination with gemcitabine on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and confirmed the results by apoptosis assay. Further we analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the expression of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1Î² by RT-PCR on HeLa cells. RESULTS: In the present study, sulforaphane was found to induce dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile.
