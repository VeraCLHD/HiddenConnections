Galactose-1-phosphate, the substrate of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, accumulates within cells, and surplus galactose is reduced to galactitol or oxidized to galactonate. Using sophisticated mass spectrometry, these compounds as well as free galactose can be measured in plasma and in urine. It is clear that initiation of dietary restriction of galactose in the newborn period produces reversal of hepatic, renal, brain, and immune dysfunction, along with reduction of the accumulated galactose metabolites.
