Those foods with the lowest cariogenic potential indices were peanuts, gelatin dessert, corn chips, yoghurt, and bologna; with the highest cariogenic potential indices were sucrose, granola cereal, french fries, bananas, cupcakes, and raisins. There was no simple relationship between food sucrose content and caries. Enhanced cariogenic potential was associated with foods containing approximately 1% or more hydrolyzable starch in combination with sucrose or other sugars.
