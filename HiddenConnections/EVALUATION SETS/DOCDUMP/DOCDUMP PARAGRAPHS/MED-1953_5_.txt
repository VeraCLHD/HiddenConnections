Adequate relief was reported by 53.3% on placebo and 53.3% in both ginger groups combined. Side effects were mild and reported by 35.7% in the placebo and 16.7% in the ginger groups. Conclusions This double blind randomized controlled pilot study suggests ginger is well tolerated but did not perform better than placebo.
