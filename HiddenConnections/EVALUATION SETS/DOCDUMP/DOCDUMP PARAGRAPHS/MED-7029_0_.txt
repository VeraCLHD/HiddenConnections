Abstract OBJECTIVE: Regular nut consumption is associated with lower rates of heart attack. However, as nuts are fatty foods, they may in theory lead to weight gain, although preliminary evidence has suggested otherwise. We tested the hypothesis that a free daily supplement (averaging 76 kJ) of almonds for six months, with no dietary advice, would not change body weight.
