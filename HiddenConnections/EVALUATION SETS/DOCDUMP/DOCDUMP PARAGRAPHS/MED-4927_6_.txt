Methods Blood concentrations of harmane and lead were each quantified in 257 individuals (106 essential tremor cases and 151 controls) enrolled in an environmental epidemiological study. Total tremor score (range = 0 – 36) was a clinical measure of tremor severity. Results The total tremor score ranged from 0 – 36, indicating that a full spectrum of tremor severities was captured in our sample.
