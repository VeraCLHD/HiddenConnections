In conclusion, from a screening that included a variety of fruits and vegetables, we found antiplatelet activity in green beans and tomatoes, anticoagulant activities in grapes and raspberries, whereas fibrinolytic activity was observed only in raspberries. Further investigations are necessary to advance in knowledge of the active compounds of these fruits and vegetables and their mechanisms of action.
