The efficacy of messages such as 'cook poultry meat and eggs thoroughly' or 'wash your hands' will depend both on the ability to change consumer behaviour as well as where the risk can best be mitigated. In order to prioritise what message should be given to the consumer, the relative contribution of different exposure pathways finally leading to ingestion of the pathogens and resulting in illness needs to be known. It is important to know whether cross-contamination events or undercooking are the greatest risk lurking in consumers' kitchens.
