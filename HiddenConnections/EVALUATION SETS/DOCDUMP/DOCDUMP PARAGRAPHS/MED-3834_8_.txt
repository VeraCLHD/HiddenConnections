High fat meals induce upright GER in normals, but do not significantly affect the abnormal amount of GER in patients. In addition, progressive increases in acid exposure were found over the 3 postprandial hours in GER patients in a recumbent position. The findings are consistent with prior data showing decreased LESP with a fat meal in normals.
