Antibiotic resistance did not increase in the cranberry group. Cranberries and TMP-SMX were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: In premenopausal women, TMP-SMX, 480 mg once daily, is more effective than cranberry capsules, 500 mg twice daily, to prevent recurrent UTIs, at the expense of emerging antibiotic resistance.
