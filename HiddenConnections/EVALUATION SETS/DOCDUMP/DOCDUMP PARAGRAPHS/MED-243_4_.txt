Six studies analyzed fruit and vegetables separately and five of them found that higher consumption of vegetables, but not fruit is associated with a decreased risk of dementia or cognitive decline. The same association was found by three further studies for fruit and vegetable consumption analytically combined. CONCLUSION: Increased intake of vegetables is associated with a lower risk of dementia and slower rates of cognitive decline in older age.
