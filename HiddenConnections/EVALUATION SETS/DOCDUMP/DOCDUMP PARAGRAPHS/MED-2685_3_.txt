METHOD: A sample of 30 information leaflets, aimed at parents and children aged 3-16 years, was sourced during the winter of 2005-2006. A qualitative content analysis was carried out to identify key recommendations on type, frequency and quantity of food and drink and general diet-related health advice. RESULTS: Most leaflets (21) promoted milk and water in agreement with nutritional guidelines.
