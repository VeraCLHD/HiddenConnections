Zeranol (Z) is a non-steroidal anabolic growth promoter with potent estrogenic activity that is widely used in the US beef industry. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of Z- and leptin-induced proliferation of primary cultured human breast cancer epithelial cells (HBCECs). A cell proliferation assay was used to determine the extent to which Z is capable of enhancing the mitogenic activity of leptin in HBCECs.
