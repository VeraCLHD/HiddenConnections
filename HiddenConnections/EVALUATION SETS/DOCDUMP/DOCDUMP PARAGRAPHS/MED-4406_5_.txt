RESULTS: The prevalence of sciatica was 3.3% for men and 2.2% for women. In men without hyperlipidemia treatment, sciatica was associated with total cholesterol (high vs. low tertile: OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.14-4.55), LDL cholesterol (2.12; 1.11-4.05), and triglycerides (1.92; 1.04-3.55), adjusted for age, BMI, exercise, smoking, heavy physical work, and education. HDL was not associated with sciatica.
