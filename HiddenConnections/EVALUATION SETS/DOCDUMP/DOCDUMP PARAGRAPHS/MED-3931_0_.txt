Abstract One hundred and eighteen missionaries working on 75 mission stations or hospitals in 24 sub-Saharan African countries provided information about their medical practice in the preceding year of 1981. Details were collected of the total number of patients seen and admitted during the year, and the number of cases of bloody diarrhoea, typhoid and inflammatory bowel disease. Over 1 million outpatients and about 190,000 inpatients were treated.
