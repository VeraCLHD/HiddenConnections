Abstract The effects of aqueous extracts of raw and boiled garlic and onions were studied in vitro on the collagen-induced platelet aggregation using rabbit and human platelet-rich plasma. A dose dependant inhibition of rabbit platelet aggregation was observed with garlic. Onion also showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the collagen-induced platelet aggregation but this inhibition was of a lesser magnitude compared to garlic when related to dose.
