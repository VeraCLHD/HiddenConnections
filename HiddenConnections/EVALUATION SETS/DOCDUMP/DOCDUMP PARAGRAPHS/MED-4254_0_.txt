Abstract BACKGROUND: Impaired flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and increased wall thickness (WT) of the brachial artery have been associated with atherosclerosis and its risk factors. In this study we sought to determine brachial artery wall thickness in chronic smokers and the instantaneous effect of smoking on brachial artery endothelium dependent vasodilator function in smokers and non-smokers. METHOD AND RESULTS: Using a high-resolution ultrasound, WT of posterior brachial artery wall, the diameter of brachial artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia (FMD %), as well as after sublingual administration of nitroglycerine (nitroglycerine mediated dilatation (NMD) %) was measured in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers.
