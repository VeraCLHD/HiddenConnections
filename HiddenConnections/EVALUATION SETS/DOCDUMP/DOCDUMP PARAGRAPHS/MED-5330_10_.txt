No consistent trends were noted for fat or fibre intakes. For non-dietary variables investigated, a history of cholecystectomy increased the risk of both cancers combined (OR = 3.43, p less than 0.05) and colon cancer alone (OR = 4.39, p less than 0.01). This study in an Asian population of countries of Southern and Eastern Asia newly undergoing industrialization and in which rapid economic change is reflected in changing cancer patterns, suggests that the protective effects of certain dietary constituents, notably the cruciferous vegetables, may be more important than the hitherto stressed carcinogenic potential of fat and protein.
