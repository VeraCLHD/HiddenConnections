Pain, knee range of motion, and overall physical activity were evaluated prior to the start of treatment and monthly thereafter. Serum levels of glycoprotein 39 (YKL-40), a marker of cartilage degradation, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a growth factor associated with cartilage synthesis, were assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. Overall, SP improved OA-associated symptoms such as range of motion and several factors associated with pain and quality of life in comparison to MP.
