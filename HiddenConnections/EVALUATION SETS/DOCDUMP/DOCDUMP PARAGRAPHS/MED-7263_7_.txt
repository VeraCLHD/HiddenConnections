Within the holoTC indeterminate zone (defined as 20-30 pmol/L), discriminant analysis selected only erythrocyte folate, which correctly allocated 65% (58/89) of the observations. Renal dysfunction compromised the diagnostic accuracy of MMA but not holoTC or serum cobalamin. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of holoTC as the first-line diagnostic procedure for vitamin B₁₂ status.
