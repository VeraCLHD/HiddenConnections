The NAFLD group consumed almost twice the amount of soft drinks (P=0.03) and 27% more meat (P<0.001). In contrast, the NAFLD group consumed somewhat less fish rich in omega-3 (P=0.056). Adjusting for age, gender, BMI and total calories, intake of soft drinks and meat was significantly associated with an increased risk for NAFLD (OR=1.45, 1.13-1.85 95% CI and OR=1.37, 1.04-1.83 95% CI, respectively).
