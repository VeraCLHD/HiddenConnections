Per 100 g of food, grapefruit and watermelon imparted the most lycopene (69 and 64 µg respectively), carrot the most α-carotene (559 µg), β-carotene (1078 µg), lutein (91 µg) and phytoene (23 mg) and mango the most violaxanthin (177 µg). Digestive stability averaged over 80%, except for the xanthophylls, which exhibited a wider and lower range of stabilities. CONCLUSION: These data identify raw food sources for carotenoid bioaccessibilities comparable to those of other foods accomplished by substantial processing.
