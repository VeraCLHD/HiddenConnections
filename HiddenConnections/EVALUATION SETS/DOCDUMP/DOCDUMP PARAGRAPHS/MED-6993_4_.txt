Anthropometric indices were measured biweekly, dietary intake and appetite were assessed 4 times during the study, and plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity, lipids, and oral glucose tolerance were assessed at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the SGD group reported a reduction in fullness (p < 0.005) and gained 1.6 kg (p < 0.05). No significant changes in body weight or composition were observed with CGJ or control (no beverage added to diet).
