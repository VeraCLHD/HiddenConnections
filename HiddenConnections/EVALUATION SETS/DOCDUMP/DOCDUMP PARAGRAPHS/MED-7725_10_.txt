Genotyping of the 53 T. gondii isolates using 10 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism markers (SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1 and Apico) revealed 57 strains with 15 genotypes. Four lambs had infections with two T. gondii genotypes. Twenty-six (45.6%) strains belong to the clonal Type II lineage (these strains can be further divided into two groups based on alleles at locus Apico).
