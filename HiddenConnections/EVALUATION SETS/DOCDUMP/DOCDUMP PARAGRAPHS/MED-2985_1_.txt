The aim of this study was to investigate whether energy density of foods is an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer. In this population-based case-control study in urban Shanghai, 908 patients with pancreatic cancer and 1067 normal controls, aged 35â€“79 y, were recruited. The energy density for overall diet was calculated from food-frequency questionnaire data.
