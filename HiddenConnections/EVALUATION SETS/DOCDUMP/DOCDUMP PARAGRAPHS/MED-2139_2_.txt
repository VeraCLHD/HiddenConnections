Men were followed for 30 years for incident PD. RESULTS: In the course of follow-up, 128 developed PD (7.1/10,000 person-years). Age-adjusted incidence of PD increased with milk intake from 6.9/10,000 person-years in men who consumed no milk to 14.9/10,000 person-years in men who consumed >16 oz/day (p = 0.017).
