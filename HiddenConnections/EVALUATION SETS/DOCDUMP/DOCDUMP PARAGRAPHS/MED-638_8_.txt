However, consumption of increased gluten in the metabolic study was associated with a 13+/-4% reduction in serum triglycerides (p = 0.005) which was not seen in the normal-gluten ad libitum study. CONCLUSIONS: The protective effect of wheat fiber in cardiovascular disease cannot be explained by an effect of wheat bran in reducing serum cholesterol although in hyperlipidemic subjects displacement of carbohydrate by gluten on the high-fiber phases was associated with lower serum triglycerides.
