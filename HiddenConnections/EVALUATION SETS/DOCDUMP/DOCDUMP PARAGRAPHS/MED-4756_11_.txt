Fatal and non-fatal stroke was borderline reduced (0.76, 0.58-0.99) with intervention versus control. CONCLUSIONS: Despite interventions being mostly successful in retarding progression to overt diabetes, this did not result in reductions in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, or myocardial infarction, with the possible exception of stroke.
