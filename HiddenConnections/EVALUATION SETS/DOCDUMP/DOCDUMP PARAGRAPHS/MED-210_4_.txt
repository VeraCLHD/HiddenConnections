Diet was assessed twice with Burkeâ€™s comprehensive diet history method, at two baseline examinations; height, weight, and other covariates were measured annually by trained interviewers. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to examine the relation of baseline total, animal, and vegetable protein intake to likelihood of being overweight or obese at sequential annual examinations. Dietary animal protein was positively related to overweight and obesity over seven years of follow up.
