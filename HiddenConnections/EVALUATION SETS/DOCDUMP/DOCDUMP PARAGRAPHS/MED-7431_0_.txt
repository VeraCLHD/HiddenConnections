Abstract Neurocysticercosis cases were identified in 1991 in an Orthodox Jewish community. Transmission was linked to tapeworm-infected immigrant housekeepers from countries where Taenia solium is endemic. To evaluate the extent of and risks for locally acquired cysticercosis, a seroprevalence survey was conducted in 9% of the households in this community.
