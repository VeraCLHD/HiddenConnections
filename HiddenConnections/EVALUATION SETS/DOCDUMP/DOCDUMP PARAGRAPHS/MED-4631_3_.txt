Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to quantify levels of LDL and HDL particle subclasses and mean particle sizes in plasma obtained at baseline and after 7 months of treatment with gemfibrozil or placebo. Odds ratios for a 1-SD increment of each lipoprotein variable were calculated with adjusted logistic regression models. Gemfibrozil treatment increased LDL size and lowered numbers of LDL particles (-5%) while raising numbers of HDL particles (10%) and small HDL subclass particles (21%).
