A popular local dish "nasi-lemak", a source of high saturated fat content from coconut milk, was chosen to represent a local high-fat meal (LHF). In addition, the effects of a Western high-fat (WHF) ("McDonald's") meal and a low-fat (LF) meal control on endothelial function were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 10 healthy male non-smoker (mean age 22 +/- 2 years) with normal body mass index, normal fasting sugar and lipid profiles.
