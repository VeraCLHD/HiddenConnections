Abstract We examined effects of fiber on stool output, since this is one of the primary mediating variables for the hypothesized relationship between fiber and disease. Total neutral detergent fiber in the dietary fiber source was predictive of stool weight but not frequency. Substantial individual differences in stool output remained when dietary factors were controlled.
