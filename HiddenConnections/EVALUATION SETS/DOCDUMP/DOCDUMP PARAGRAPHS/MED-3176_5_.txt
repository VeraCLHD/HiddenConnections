In the acute study, GFR and RPF both rose significantly by approximately 16% (P less than 0.005) and approximately 14% (P less than 0.05), respectively, after the meat load, while RVR fell by approximately 12% (P less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in these parameters following the soya load. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
