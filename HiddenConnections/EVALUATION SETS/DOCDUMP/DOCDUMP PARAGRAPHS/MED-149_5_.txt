Participants were assigned to a low-fat diet or two traditional MedDiets (MedDiet + virgin olive oil or MedDiet + nuts). Both MedDiet group participants received nutritional education and either free extra virgin olive oil for all the family (1 L/week), or free nuts (30 g/day). Diets were ad libitum.
