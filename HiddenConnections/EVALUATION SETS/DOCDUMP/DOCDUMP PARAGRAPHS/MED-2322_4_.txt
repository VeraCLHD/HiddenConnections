Our results indicate that prepregnancy, high daily intake of total fat increases the risk of severe hyperemesis gravidarum (odds ratio = 2.9 for each 25 gm per day increase; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-6.0). This association is driven primarily by saturated fat intake [odds ratio = 5.4 for each 15 gm per day increase (equivalent to one quarter-pound cheeseburger); 95% confidence interval = 2.0-14.8]. We observed no independent effect of total energy intake.
