The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure. Nonsmoking men (n = 142) and women (n = 225) aged 45-70 y were randomly assigned to treatment for 12 mo; 312 subjects completed the intervention. RESULTS: Compliance with the intervention was corroborated by significant dose-dependent increases in the proportions of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte lipids and a 16.5% reduction in serum triacylglycerol concentrations with 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs/d.
