We detected gene-environment interactions between 25-OHD concentration and rs11568820 genotype for CRC-specific (P = .008) and all-cause (P = .022) mortality, number of protective alleles (P = .004 and P = .018, respectively), and GAGC haplotype at the VDR locus for all-cause mortality (P = .008). CONCLUSION: In patients with stage I to III CRC, postoperative plasma vitamin D is associated with clinically important differences in survival outcome, higher levels being associated with better outcome. We observed interactions between 25-OHD level and VDR genotype, suggesting a causal relationship between vitamin D and survival.
