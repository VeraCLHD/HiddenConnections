Compliance with dietary recommendations was checked by validated food frequency questionnaires. Compliance with total and animal protein intakes was assessed by 24-hour urea and sulfate outputs, respectively. The nutritional intervention (oral instructions, written leaflet, phoning) and food assessment were carried out by a research dietitian.
