DR7DR53 molecules were also involved in the recognition of an immunodominant M5 peptide in these patients. T cells infiltrating RHD hearts displayed several oligoclonal expansions. Intralesional T-cell clones presenting identical TCR-BVBJ AVAJ and -CDR3 sequences were able to recognize several antigens with little or low homology, showing an intramolecular degenerate pattern of antigen recognition.
