In addition, gamma-OR inhibited 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the hypocholesterolemic activity of gamma-OR is due in part to impaired apical uptake of cholesterol into enterocytes and perhaps a decrease in HMG-CoA reductase activity.
