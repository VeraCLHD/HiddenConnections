METHODS: To evaluate the anti-allergic effect of TE, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 33 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) using oral administration of TE (360 mg per day) or placebo for 8 weeks. RESULTS: We found that the sneezing score significantly decreased in the TE group at the end of the trial compared to the beginning (P < 0.05). There were decreasing tendencies of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction in the TE group.
