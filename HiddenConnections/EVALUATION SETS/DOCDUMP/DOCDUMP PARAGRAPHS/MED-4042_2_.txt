Therefore, we hypothesized that BDG consumption improves inflammatory markers and insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese subjects with moderately increased levels of C-reactive protein, indicating subclinical inflammation. We screened 180 overweight and obese subjects for moderately increased C-reactive protein levels on 2 or more occasions, in the absence of any signs of acute infection. Twelve of the subjects met all inclusion criteria and were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design for 2 x 4 weeks (washout > or =4 weeks).
