Design In a cohort of 1034 North American women, each subject was asked retrospectively about their fruit and vegetable intake during the six months before the pregnancy and their occurrences of URI during the first half of pregnancy. Multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. Results The adjusted HRs of URI for women in the highest quartile (median = 8.54 servings/day) vs. lowest quartile (median = 1.91 servings/day) of total fruit and vegetable intake were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-1.05) for the 5-month follow-up period and 0.61 (95% CI = 0.39-0.97) for the 3-month follow-up period, respectively.
