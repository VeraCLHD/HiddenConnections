Mitochondrial DNA copy number and telomere length in PBMCs were determined, and biochemical tests were performed. Habitual physical exercise was defined as combined aerobic and resistance exercise performed for at least 60 minutes per session more than three times a week for more than 12 months. RESULTS: The mean age of all participants was 58.11 ± 6.84 years, and participants in the habitual exercise group had been exercising more than three times per week for an average of 19.23 ± 5.15 months.
