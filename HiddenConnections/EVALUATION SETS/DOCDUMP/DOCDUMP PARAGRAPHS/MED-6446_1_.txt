Serum IL-17 is increased in allergic patients and relates to clinical severity. Recently, it has been reported that CD161 is a highly upregulated gene in Th17 clones and all IL-17-producing cells are contained in CD161(+) T cells. This study aimed at comparing the frequency of peripheral CD161(+) T cells in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and in healthy controls and at relating CD161 expression with symptom severity.
