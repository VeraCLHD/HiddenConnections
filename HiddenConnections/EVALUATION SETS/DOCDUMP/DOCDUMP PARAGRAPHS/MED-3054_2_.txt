Tomato plants were transformed with a soybean (Glycine max L) isoflavone synthase (GmIFS2) cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated the presence of genistin (genistein 7-O-glucoside) as the major isoflavone metabolite in the transgenic plants. Substantial amounts of genistin (up to 90 nmol/g FW) were found in leaves, while the levels were marginally detectable (less than 0.5 nmol/g FW) in fruit peels.
