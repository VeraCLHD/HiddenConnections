Abstract Ovulatory function was prospectively assessed over 6 mo in 23 vegetarians and 22 nonvegetarians with clinically normal menstrual cycles. Subjects were 20-40 y of age, of stable weight (body mass index, in kg/m2, of 18-25), on current diets for > or = 2 y, and not using oral contraceptives. Quantitative analysis of basal body temperature records classified cycles as normally ovulatory, short luteal phase (< 10 d), or anovulatory.
