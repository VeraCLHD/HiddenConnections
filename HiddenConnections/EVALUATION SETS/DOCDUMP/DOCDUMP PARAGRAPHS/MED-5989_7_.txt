However, the lipoxidation marker malondialdehydelysine was inversely correlated with MLSP (r2=0.85; P<0.001). The amino acid compositional analysis revealed that methionine is the only amino acid strongly correlated MLSP and that such correlation is negative (r2=0.93; P<0.001). This trait may contribute to lower steady-state levels of oxidized methionine residues in cellular proteins.
