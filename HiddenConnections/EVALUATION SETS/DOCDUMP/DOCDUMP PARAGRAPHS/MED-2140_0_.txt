Abstract The molecular mechanism underlying the flavonoid-induced inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibrillation was thoroughly examined by various biochemical and biophysical approaches. The noncovalent binding of the inhibitory flavonoids to alpha-synuclein and the covalent modification by the flavonoid quinone led to the restriction of the conformational changes in this natively unfolded protein and to the stabilization of soluble flavonoid-modified species of alpha-synuclein (monomers and oligomers). All of these factors rather than a single one contribute to the inhibition of WT alpha-synuclein fibrillation induced by the flavonoid.
