L* values were significantly higher, indicating lighter fillets in the ES and decapitated birds compared with the darker fillets from the CO(2) stunned and bled birds. The CO(2) slaughter and not bled birds had significantly higher a* values, indicating more red color, when compared with the ES and bled and decapitated birds. There were no significant differences in the residual hemoglobin contents in the broiler breast muscle when comparing all of the treatments except CO(2) slaughter and not bled, which was significantly (around 15%) greater.
