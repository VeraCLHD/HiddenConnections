Risk factors for CKD including diabetes, hypertension, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption and age were also considered. RESULTS: A total of 677 (20.7 %) men were found to have CKD and 427 (13.1 %) participants reported a history of betel-nut use. The prevalence (24.8 %) of CKD in betel-nut users was significantly higher than that (11.3 %) of participants without betel-nut use (P = 0.026).
