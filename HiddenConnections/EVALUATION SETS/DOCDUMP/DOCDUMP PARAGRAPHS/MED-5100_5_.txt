Anti-Gal binding and stimulatory effects were assessed in primary thyrocyte cultures. Anti-Gal specifically bound to GD thyrocytes and induced an increase in cAMP synthesis, 125I uptake, and DNA synthesis in these cells. Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of autologous sera on GD thyrocytes were greatly reduced after specific depletion of anti-Gal from these sera.
