When further evaluated, RAC pigs had a boneless shoulder (Boston butt + picnic) yield advantage of 0.32% units (P < 0.01; SED = 0.11), a 0.43% unit (P = 0.01; SED = 0.13) yield advantage in the boneless loin (Canadian back + tenderloin + sirloin), and a 0.51% unit (P < 0.001; SED = 0.11) advantage in the boneless ham (inside + outside + knuckle). A boneless yield was calculated using a summation of the percentage of side weight from the boneless shoulder, boneless loin, and boneless ham, which resulted in a 1.08% unit (36.28% vs. 35.20%, respectively; P = 0.002; SED = 0.25) advantage of RAC pigs when compared with control pigs. There were no subprimal yield differences (P = 0.93) in the trimmed belly between RAC pigs (12.18%) and control pigs (12.18%).
