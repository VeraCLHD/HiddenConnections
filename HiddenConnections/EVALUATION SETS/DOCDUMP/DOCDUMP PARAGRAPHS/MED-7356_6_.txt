Overall, medical students received 19.6 contact hours of nutrition instruction during their medical school careers (range: 0â€“70 hours); the average in 2004 was 22.3 hours. Only 28 (27%) of the 105 schools met the minimum 25 required hours set by the National Academy of Sciences; in 2004, 40 (38%) of 104 schools did so. Conclusions The amount of nutrition education that medical students receive continues to be inadequate.
