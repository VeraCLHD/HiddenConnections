Abstract It is hypothesised that chronic progressive kidney disease may be mediated by abnormalities of lipid metabolism. A series of self-perpetuating secondary events follows an initial glomerular injury. Increased glomerular basement membrane permeability leads to loss of lipoprotein lipase activators, resulting in hyperlipidaemia.
