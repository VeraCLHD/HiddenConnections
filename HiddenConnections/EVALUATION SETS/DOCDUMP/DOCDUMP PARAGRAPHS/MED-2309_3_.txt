We found a significantly high correlation (r=0.979; p<0.001) between blood T-Hg (17.3+/-10.9 microg/L) and MeHg (15.3+/-9.2 microg/L). We also found significantly higher blood MeHg levels in participants with high local fish and seafood consumption, which revealed that dietary intake was the major exposure route of MeHg. All the participants were assigned to the high-MeHg (H-MeHg, 27.0+/-10.4 microg/L) or low-MeHg (L-MeHg, 11.6+/-4.7 microg/L) groups based on the 75th percentile of their blood MeHg (19.2 microg/L), and then matched for cognitive function confounders: age, gender, and education levels.
