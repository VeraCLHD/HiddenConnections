Due to minimal absorption of chlorhexidine into the tissues and low concentrations of free chlorhexidine in the oral cavity, the DNA damage produced by chlorhexidine in lymphocytes was lower than in buccal epithelial cells. As chlorhexidine does not accumulate in the body, the frequencies of DNA damage could be transient. Detected DNA damage after CHX use might be the indication of an earlier effect, before DNA repair begins, and could be reversible.
