Recently, SIRT1 has been shown to affect amyloid production through its influence over the ADAM10 gene. Upregulation of SIRT1 can also induce the Notch pathway and inhibit mTOR signalling. SUMMARY: Recent studies have revealed some of the mechanisms and pathways that are associated with the neuroprotective effects of SIRT1.
