The vascular endothelium plays a key role in local vascular tone regulation and can be modulated by dietary fat. We propose to determine the chronic effect of three diets with different fat compositions on postprandial endothelial function and inflammatory biomarkers. Twenty healthy men followed three 4-week diets in a randomised cross-over design: a Western diet, rich in saturated fat (22% SFA, 12% MUFA and 0.4% alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), all fractions are % of energy); a Mediterranean diet, rich in MUFA ( < 10 % SFA, 24 % MUFA and 0.4% ALA); a low-fat diet enriched in ALA ( < 10% SFA, 12% MUFA and 2% ALA).
