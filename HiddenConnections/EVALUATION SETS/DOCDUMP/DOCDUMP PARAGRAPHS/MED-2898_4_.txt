A randomised, controlled, crossover trial with healthy women (n = 16) was conducted. The acute effects of four doses of nitrate (0 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, as well as 400 mg plus antibacterial toothpaste), administered in random order, were compared. Measurements included biomarkers of plasma nitric oxide status, assessed by measuring S-nitrosothiols + other nitroso species (RXNO) and nitrite, and a biomarker of nitrate reduction in the mouth, assessed by measuring salivary nitrite.
