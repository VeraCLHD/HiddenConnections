Evidence suggests that the diet directly influences the diversity of the microbiota, providing the link between diet, colonic disease, and colon cancer. The microbiota, however, can determine the efficiency of food absorption and risk of obesity. SUMMARY: Our investigations have focused on a small number of bacterial species: characterization of microbiota and its metabolism can be expected to provide the key to colonic health and disease.
