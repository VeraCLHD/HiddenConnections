Mutations in the CYP24A1 gene cause reduced serum 24,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 ratio (<0.02), elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3), hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. Studies in infants have shown that 3-epi-25(OH)D3 can contribute 9-61.1% of the total 25(OH)D3. Therefore, measurements of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D metabolites 25(OH)D3, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 are useful to investigate whether the underlying cause of vitamin D toxicity is iatrogenic versus genetic.
