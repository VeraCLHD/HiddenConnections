RESULTS: Raised lesions of the coronary arteries, the advanced lesions of atherosclerosis that lead directly to CHD, are associated positively with non-HDL cholesterol concentration, hypertension, obesity (in men), and blood glucose concentration; and inversely, with HDL cholesterol concentration. Smoking affects predominantly the abdominal aorta. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that long-range prevention of CHD should begin in adolescence or at least in young adulthood with control of the major established risk factors for adult CHD.
