Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed by intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (1, 10, and 50 microg/min), and endothelium-independent vasodilation was assessed by intracoronary bolus infusion of isosorbide dinitrate (2.5 mg) or papaverine (10 mg). A single 3-hour LDL apheresis reduced serum LDL cholesterol by an average of 86.6 +/- 1.7%. After the LDL apheresis, the changes in the coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow in response to an infusion of 50 microg/min of acetylcholine increased significantly compared to the pre-apheresis values (from -19.7 +/- 4.8 to -2.9 +/- 3.0% [P < 0.01] and from 80.7 +/- 27.6 to 155.3 +/- 23.5% [P < 0.01], respectively).
