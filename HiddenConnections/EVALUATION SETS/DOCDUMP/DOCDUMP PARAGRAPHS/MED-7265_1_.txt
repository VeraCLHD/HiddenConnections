Using gel-exclusion chromatography we found that the mean MR for the B12 binding protein derived from egg yolk was 125,000, whereas that derived from egg white was 97,750. Heat treatment of the apoprotein differentially reduced the binding capacity of egg yolk and egg white in a time-dependent manner with the greatest decrease in binding capacity occurring with egg white. In contrast, heat treatment of the holoenzyme delineated the egg yolk as the more labile.
