Compared to those with sodium excretion of 3600 to <4800 mg/24hr, risk for those with sodium <2300 mg/24hr was 32% lower after multivariable adjustment (HR=0.68, 95%CI = 0.34â€“1.37, p for trend = 0.13). There was a linear 17% increase in risk per 1000 mg/24hr (p=0.05). Spline curves supported a linear association of sodium with cardiovascular events, continuing to descend from 3600 to 2300 and 1500 mg/24hr, although the data were sparse at the lowest levels.
