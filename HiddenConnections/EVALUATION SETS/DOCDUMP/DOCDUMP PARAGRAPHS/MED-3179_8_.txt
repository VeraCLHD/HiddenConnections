ISP consumption led to changes of -9.5% in urinary albumin excretion (P < 0.0001), -0.45 in the total-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio (P < 0.05), -0.20 in the LDL-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (P < 0.05), and +4.3% in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.0040). Plasma arginine concentrations, the arginine-to-lysine ratio, and plasma isoflavone concentrations were higher after ISP consumption (P < 0.05). Urinary albumin excretion was negatively correlated with plasma total isoflavones (rho = -0.441), daidzein (rho = -0.326), and O-desmethylangolesin (rho = -0.389) (P < 0.05).
