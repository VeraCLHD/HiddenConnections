MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the distribution of abdominal fat, dietary intake, and biochemical data in patients with NAFLD and compared non-obese with obese patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with diabetes or dyslipidemia between the obese and non-obese groups. Waist circumference, total abdominal fat levels, and subcutaneous fat levels were significantly higher in the obese group, while visceral fat levels were not significantly different between the two groups.
