Formation of the leukotrienes from arachidonic acid is initiated by the action of 5-lipoxygenase producing leukotriene A4. Hydrolysis of leukotriene A4, or the incorporation of glutathione results in the formation of leukotriene B4 and C4, respectively. In addition, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase can catalyse arachidonic acid conversion and lipoxins A and B are amongst the possible products.
