Abstract BACKGROUND: The risk of major congenital malformations (MCM) is increased in women with pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM). Whether this risk is increased in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is still debated. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review (and meta-analysis) of major congenital malformations in women with gestational diabetes versus a reference population.
