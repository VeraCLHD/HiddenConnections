In a continuous analysis, whole blood Mn levels and expression of MnSOD correlated inversely but no other parameters associated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Tea drinking is a major source of dietary Mn and intakes commonly exceed proposed adequate intake values of 1.8-2.3 mg Mn/day and, on occasion, exceed upper limits of 10-11 mg/day. Dietary Mn intake has little influence on markers of Mn status or expression of Mn-dependent enzymes.
