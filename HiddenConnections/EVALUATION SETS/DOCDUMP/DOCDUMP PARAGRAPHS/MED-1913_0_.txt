Abstract CONTEXT: Despite increasing awareness about the potential impact of financial conflicts of interest on biomedical research, no comprehensive synthesis of the body of evidence relating to financial conflicts of interest has been performed. OBJECTIVE: To review original, quantitative studies on the extent, impact, and management of financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (January 1980-October 2002), the Web of Science citation database, references of articles, letters, commentaries, editorials, and books and by contacting experts.
