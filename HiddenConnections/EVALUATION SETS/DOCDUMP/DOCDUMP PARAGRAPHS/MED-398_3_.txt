DESIGN: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted in 90 healthy human subjects selected for normal platelet function. Changes from baseline hemostatic function were measured 3 h after consumption of extract-enriched or control supplements. RESULTS: Significant reductions in ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by ADP and collagen were observed 3 h after supplementation with doses of tomato extract equivalent to 6 (6TE) and 2 (2TE) tomatoes [3 micromol ADP/L: 6TE (high dose), -21.3%; 2TE (low dose), -12.7%; P < 0.001; 7.5 micromol ADP/L: 6TE, -7.8%, 2TE, -7.6%; P < 0.001; 3 mg collagen/L: 6TE, -17.5%; 2TE, -14.6%; P = 0.007].
