Abstract BACKGROUND: Cholesterol lowering over 1- to 3-year trials is associated with modest regression or no progression of focal coronary artery stenoses compared with progression in controls, a decrease in cardiac events proportionately more than the modest improvement in percent stenosis, and in experimental animals improved endothelial-mediated coronary vasodilation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Accordingly, we hypothesized that there would be improvement in size and severity of perfusion abnormalities by rest-dipyridamole positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a randomized intensive cholesterol-lowering trial with each patient studied after a baseline control period, a 90-day intensive cholesterol-lowering treatment, and a final control period off cholesterol-lowering regimens. Completely automated, objective measures of size and severity of perfusion abnormalities on rest-dipyridamole PET images were made by computer algorithm in 12 patients with coronary artery disease.
