Since this condition is associated with a disruption of the functioning of the HPA axis, stress-induced HPA axis activation has been identified to play an important role in this preferential body fat accumulation. HPA axis activation increases cortisol (corticosterone) production which has been shown to exert hyperphagic and antithermogenic effects. Since abdominal adipose tissue has more cells per mass units, higher blood flow and more glucocorticoid receptors, glucocorticoids affect abdominal fat to a greater extent than subcutaneous adipose tissue.
