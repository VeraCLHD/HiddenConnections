METHODS: Published clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses of OTC ibuprofen use, defined as up to 1200â€‰mg/day or stated as 'over the counter,' reporting endpoints of incidence rates and proportions of GI bleeding events (e.g., GI bleeding-related hospitalizations and deaths) were identified via MEDLINE through 2010. Data from these studies were summarized. RESULTS: Twenty studies (nine observational, ten clinical trials, one meta-analysis) reporting incidence rates and proportions of a GI bleeding-related event associated with OTC or OTC-specific doses of ibuprofen were included.
