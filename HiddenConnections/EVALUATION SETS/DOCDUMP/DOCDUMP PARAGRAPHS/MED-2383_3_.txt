Their EE was determined from galvanic skin response, heat flux, and biaxial accelerometry using a multisensor armband. Lake Louise Scores for altitude illness assessment were obtained each morning. RESULTS: Average daily total EE and number of steps taken was 4173 ± 848 kcal/d (range, 3332 to 4838 kcal/d) and 26,232 ± 7210 steps/d (range, 11,788 to 34,979 steps/d), respectively.
