Abstract OBJECTIVE: The onset and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seem to be affected by nutritive intake; however, detailed examinations have not been performed in non-obese NAFLD patients. The purpose of this study was to identify potential nutritive factors that affect NAFLD and its related nutritional problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated the distribution of abdominal fat, dietary intake, and biochemical data in patients with NAFLD and compared non-obese with obese patients.
