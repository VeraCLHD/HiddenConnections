In addition, the effects of a Western high-fat (WHF) ("McDonald's") meal and a low-fat (LF) meal control on endothelial function were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 10 healthy male non-smoker (mean age 22 +/- 2 years) with normal body mass index, normal fasting sugar and lipid profiles. Nitric oxide dependent flow-mediated dilation and nitric oxide independent (GTN) dilation was assessed by Doppler flow in the brachial artery before and 4 hours after each meal on separate occasions by 2 experienced sonographers blinded to the type of meals.
