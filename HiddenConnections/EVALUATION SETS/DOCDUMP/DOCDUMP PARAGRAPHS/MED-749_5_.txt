HCV-RNA levels were significantly higher in Group B [(6.2 ± 1.5) × 10(5)vs (3.9 ± 1.0) × 10(5)UI/mL, p=0.05]. During coffee intake, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and collagen levels were significantly lower than during abstinence (15 ± 3 vs 44 ± 16 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine/10(5)deoxyguanosine, p=0.05 and 56 ± 9 vs 86 ± 21 ng/mL, p=0.04). Telomere length was significantly higher in patients during coffee intake (0.68 ± 0.06 vs 0.48 ± 0.04 Arbitrary Units, p=0.006).
