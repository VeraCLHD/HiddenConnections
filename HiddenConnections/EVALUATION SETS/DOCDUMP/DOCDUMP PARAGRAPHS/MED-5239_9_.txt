Asi was the main As species in most food products tested in this study. Conclusions: There are currently no U.S. regulations applicable to As in food, but our findings suggest that the OBRS products we evaluated may introduce significant concentrations of Asi into an individualâ€™s diet. Thus, we conclude that there is an urgent need for regulatory limits on As in food.
