Data were collected from 383 overweight or obese women who participated in a 2-year clinical trial of a weight-loss program, in which 51% (N = 195) lost at least 5% of baseline weight by 24 months, 18% (N = 67) lost 5–10%, and 33% (N = 128) lost >10%. Women who did not lose weight at 24 months had an increase in serum 25(OH)D of 1.9 (9.7) ng/ml (mean (SD)); 25(OH)D increased by 2.7 (9.1) ng/ml for those who lost 5–10% of baseline weight; and 25(OH)D increased by 5.0 (9.2) ng/ml for those who lost >10% of baseline weight (P = 0.014). At baseline, 51% (N = 197) of participants met or exceeded the recommended serum concentration of 20 ng/ml.
