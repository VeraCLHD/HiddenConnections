Secondary outcomes included MI and stroke individually. Results During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 11.2 (10.7 to 13.3) years, there were 1,732 confirmed major cardiovascular events. Compared with placebo, there was no significant effect of a daily multivitamin on major cardiovascular events (active and placebo multivitamin groups, 11.0 and 10.8 events per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91â€“1.10; P=0.91).
