Studies with ERbeta-knockout mice could be helpful for clarifying whether ERbeta does indeed mediate the chief physiological effects of low nanomolar genistein. S-equol, a bacterial metabolite of daidzein, has an affinity for ERbeta nearly as high as that of genistein; whether this compound contributes meaningfully to the physiological efficacy of soy isoflavones in some individuals is still unclear.
