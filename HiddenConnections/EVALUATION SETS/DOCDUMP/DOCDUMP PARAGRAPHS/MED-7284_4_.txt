Moreover, TPL inhibited the clonogenic growth of MCF 7 cells, which was significantly recovered by pifithrin-alpha, the p53 inhibitor. However, pifithrin-alpha, did not modify TPL induced cytotoxicity in T 47 D cells. Exogenous addition of antioxidants, glutathione (GSH) and N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) inhibited the anti-proliferative ability of TPL in both MCF 7 and T47 D. Annexin-V and propidium iodide double staining of cells treated with TPL for 2h revealed that TPL induced significant apoptosis in both the cell lines in a dose dependant manner but magnitude of apoptosis was significantly higher in MCF 7 than in T 47-D cells.
