Racemic derivatives with C4'-OH coupled linkers C5H10COOH and C9H18COOH were synthesized carrying a methylated C7-OH. Another racemic C4'-OH hapten (CH2COOH) was prepared starting from naringenin. The haptens elicited variable antibody titers dependent on linker lengths, with short linkers giving the best results.
