In this context, recent demonstration of elevated levels of mutagenic antiviral enzyme APOBEC3B in a majority of BCs is a highly significant development, as it provides a possible mechanism for development of large numbers of mutations (kataegis) that characterize many of the BCs. It has also provided further impetus for revaluating the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of BC.
