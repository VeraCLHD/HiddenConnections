OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the association between daylight exposure in an uncontrolled daily life setting and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 192 elderly individuals (mean age, 69.9 yr). MEASURES: We measured ambulatory daylight exposure using a wrist light meter in two 48-h sessions; furthermore, we measured overnight urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, an index of melatonin secretion, on the second night of each session.
