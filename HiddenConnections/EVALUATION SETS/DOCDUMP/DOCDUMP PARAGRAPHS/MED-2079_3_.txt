Using CellTiter 96â„¢ Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation assay, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we evaluated the effects of sera harvested from experimental and control heifers before and after one month of zeranol implantation on the growth of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 as well as the involved mechanisms. We found that sera harvested from the heifers following one month of zeranol implantation were more mitogenically potent in stimulating the proliferation of MCF-7 cells when compared to sera harvested from the same heifers before zeranol implantation and the control heifers. Further investigation found that dextran-coated charcoal suppressed the stimulating effect of the sera on MCF-7 cell growth.
