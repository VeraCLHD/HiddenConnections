After measurement of body weight and height, and estimation of age, casual blood samples were obtained. Estimated age ranged from 20 to 68 years, with men averaging 37 and women 35 years. Mean serum total cholesterol was very low among both men (123 mg/dl) and women (142 mg/dl) compared with western samples, whereas triglycerides--112 and 110 mg/dl, respectively--were lower among men and slightly higher among women than for U.S. men and women.
