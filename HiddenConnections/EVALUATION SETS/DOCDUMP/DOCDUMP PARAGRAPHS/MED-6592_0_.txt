Abstract BACKGROUND: Evidence from case-control studies suggest that dietary fiber may be inversely related to breast cancer risk, but it is unclear if this is supported by prospective data. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from prospective studies. METHODS: PubMed was searched for prospective studies of fiber intake and breast cancer risk until 31st August 2011.
