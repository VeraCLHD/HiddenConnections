RESULTS: Human fetal testis xenografts showed similar survival (âˆ¼80%) and total graft weight (8.6 vs. 10.1 mg) in vehicle and DBP-exposed hosts, respectively. Serum testosterone (0.56 vs. 0.64 ng/ml; P>0.05) and SV weight (67.2 vs. 81.9 mg; P>0.05) also did not differ. Exposure to monobutyl phthalate gave similar results.
