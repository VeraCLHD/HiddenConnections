However, cetuximab failed to show any significant antitumor activity in the HT29, HCT116, LOVO, Colo205, LX-1, HCC70, and N87 models. All of the studied tumors had detectable yet variable levels of EGFR. For combination regimens, cetuximab (1 mg/mouse/injection, q3dx5, i.p.) and cisplatin (4.5 mg/kg/injection, q3dx5, i.v.) proved to be significantly more efficacious than individual monotherapies in the cisplatin-refractory yet cetuximab-responsive GEO tumor model (P < 0.001).
