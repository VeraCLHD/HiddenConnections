Here we show that this antibody pool is the same as the natural antibody termed anti-gal, that binds to the alpha-galactosyl carbohydrate epitope (alpha-gal) and which is the predominant obstacle to xenotransplantation. We report that there are high levels of IgD anti alpha-gal in most volunteers, in addition to the IgG2, IgA and IgM immunoglobulin isotypes against alpha-gal previously described. To determine if anti-gal may interfere with assays that depend on capture of cytokine with its receptor, we measured levels of several anti-carbohydrate antibodies in a cohort of patients with advanced atherosclerosis that had previously been used to measure levels of active TGF-beta using such an assay.
