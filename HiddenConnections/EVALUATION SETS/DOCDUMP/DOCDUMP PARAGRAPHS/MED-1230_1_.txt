The rats, two groups of 84 each, were fed zinc-adequate diets (33 ppm Zn) with either 0 (basal) or 2% phytic acid added as sodium phytate. A fourth-order exponential function described the time-course of 65Zn in plasma, and compartmental models were developed accordingly. Plasma zinc exchanged more rapidly with zinc in liver and kidneys than it did with zinc in testes, skeletal muscle, or bone.
