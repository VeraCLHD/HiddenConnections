The present study evaluated the efficacy of soy protein (SP) supplementation in relieving the pain and discomfort associated with OA. One hundred and thirty-five free-living individuals (64 men and 71 women) with diagnosed OA or with self-reported chronic knee joint pain not attributed to injury or rheumatoid arthritis were recruited for this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study. Study participants were assigned randomly to consume 40 g of either supplemental SP or milk-based protein (MP) daily for 3 months.
