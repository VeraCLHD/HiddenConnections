Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite many studies on cognitive function and its influential factors among old population, relatively little research has been designed to study the relationship between dietary intake and cognitive function in elderly. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a population-based, prospective nested case-control study to investigate the association between dietary habits and declines in cognitive function over three years among Chinese illiterate elderly. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was part of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Study (CLHLS).
