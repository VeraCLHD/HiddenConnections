Other possible mechanisms implicated in the effect of statins on new-onset diabetes are: statin interference with intracellular insulin signal transduction pathways via inhibition of necessary phosphorylation events and reduction of small GTPase action; inhibition of adipocyte differentiation leading to decreased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein which are important pathways for glucose homeostasis; decreased leptin causing inhibition of Î²-cells proliferation and insulin secretion; and diminished adiponectin levels. Given that the magnitude of the risk of new-onset diabetes following statin use remains to be fully clarified and the well-established beneficial effect of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk, statins remain the first-choice treatment for prevention of CVD. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes in association with statin use may help identify novel preventative or therapeutic approaches to this problem and/or help design a new generation statin without such side-effects.
