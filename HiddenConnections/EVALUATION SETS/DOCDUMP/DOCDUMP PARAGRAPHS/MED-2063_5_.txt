Metabolites were identified by UV-HPLC-MS/MS as monohydroxy methoxychlor and HPTE from methoxychlor, and the major metabolite of mestranol was 17alpha-ethynyl oestradiol. There was no evidence for the metabolism of isoxanthohumol. Mestranol was also activated by microsomes induced with saline (control), beta-napthoflavone, 3-methylcholantherene, isoniazid or pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile, but not phenobarbitone.
