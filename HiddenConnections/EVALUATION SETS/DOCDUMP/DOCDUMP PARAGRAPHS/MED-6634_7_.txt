Nut consumption was associated with a decreased body mass index (27.7 kg/m(2) ± 0.2 vs 28.1 ± 0.1 kg/m(2), p < 0.05), waist circumference (95.6 ± 0.4 cm vs 96.4 ± 0.3 cm, p < 0.05), and systolic blood pressure (121.9 ± 0.4 mmHg vs 123.20 ± 0.3 mmHg, p < 0.01) compared with nonconsumers. Tree nut consumers also had a lower weight (78.8 ± 0.7 kg vs 80.7 ± 0.3 kg, p < 0.05). Nut consumers had a lower percentage of two risk factors for MetS: hypertension (31.5% ± 1.0% vs 34.2% ± 0.8%, p < 0.05) and low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (29.6% ± 1.0% vs 34.8% ± 0.8%, p < 0.01).
