Six flavonoids (18-23) and three phenolic compounds (10, 11, and 14) showed potent antioxidant activities. Caffeic acid (10), quercetin (18), and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (21) showed higher antioxidant activity, with EC 50 values of <10 microM. Most tested flavonoids and phenolic compounds had high antioxidant activity when compared to ascorbic acid and might be responsible for the antioxidant activities of apples.
