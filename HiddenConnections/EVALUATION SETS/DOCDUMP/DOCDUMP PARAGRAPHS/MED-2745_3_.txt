DESIGN: In a prospective observational study, 32 subjects (n = 19 men and 13 women) with a mean (+/-SD) age of 47.5 +/- 8.3 y and a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 47.3 +/- 5.3 consumed a VLED for 12 wk. Primary outcomes included changes in liver volume (LV) and in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT). Changes in body weight, anthropometric measures, and biochemical variables were also recorded, and compliance with, acceptability of, and side effects of treatment were assessed.
