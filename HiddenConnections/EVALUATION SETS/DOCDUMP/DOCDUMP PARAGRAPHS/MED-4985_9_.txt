The lung cancer risk of former cigarette smokers drops down more quickly after quitting smoking compared to former bidi smokers. There is no evidence for the effect of chewing and lung cancer risk nor clear evidence of an effect of overall alcohol drinking among never-smokers, although Indian alcohol drinking seemed to remain associated with lung cancer risk under limited power (OR=2.67, 95%CI=1.02-7.02). Bidi smoking seems to have a stronger carcinogenic effect than cigarette smoking: this difference holds no matter which aspect of smoking was considered.
