The induction of SCE by sodium sorbate was twice the control level, whereas that by methyl methanesulphonate, a potent inducer of SCE, was 14 times the control level. The mutagenic potency of sodium sorbate was less than one-tenth that of ethyl methanesulphonate, a potent inducer of mutation, when compared at an equitoxic level. Sorbic acid and its potassium salt induced chromosome aberrations, but only at the highest doses tested.
