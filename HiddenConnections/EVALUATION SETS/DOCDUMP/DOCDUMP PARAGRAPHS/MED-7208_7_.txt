Also, the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1β upon treatment with sulforaphane. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that sulforaphane exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory properties and provides the first evidence demonstrating synergism between sulforaphane and gemcitabine which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention and/or treatment of cervical cancer.
