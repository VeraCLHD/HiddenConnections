RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature shows that bullying behaviors are common in children as young as kindergarten age, that there is a strong association between being a bully or victim and a range of psychosomatic and depressive symptoms in children, and that interventions including family therapy and school-based programs are effective for bullies and victims. Recent studies have further delineated glucose and insulin metabolism. Recent work has provided new models to help practitioners screen for the prediabetic state in hope of providing earlier opportunities to intervene and avoid the morbidities associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
