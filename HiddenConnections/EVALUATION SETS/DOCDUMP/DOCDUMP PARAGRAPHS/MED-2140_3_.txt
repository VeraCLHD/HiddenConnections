The structural requirements that appear necessary to provide a flavonoid the ability to inhibit alpha-synuclein fibrillation were determined to be vicinal dihydroxyphenyl moieties, irrespective of the ring position where they are located. Flavonoids with three vicinal hydroxyl groups exhibited enhanced inhibitory effects on alpha-synuclein fibrillation. The antioxidant activities of flavonoids were generally correlated with their in vitro inhibitory effects on alpha-synuclein fibrillation.
