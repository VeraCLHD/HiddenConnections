Close similarities between the excretory pattern, the chemical and chromatographic properties of X and of those of the known phenolic steroids suggested initially that this compound was steroidal in nature. The same, or a similar, substance seems to be excreted in the vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus). We now report the excretory pattern of X in more detail, the isolation of the pure compound from pooled pregnancy urine and the chemical structure.
