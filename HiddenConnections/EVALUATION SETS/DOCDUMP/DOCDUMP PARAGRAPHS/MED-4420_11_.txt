Fructose also promotes reactive oxygen species formation, which leads to cellular dysfunction and aging, and promotes changes in the brainâ€™s reward system, which drives excessive consumption. Thus, fructose can exert detrimental health effects beyond its calories and in ways that mimic those of ethanol, its metabolic cousin. Indeed, the only distinction is that because fructose is not metabolized in the central nervous system, it does not exert the acute neuronal depression experienced by those imbibing ethanol.
