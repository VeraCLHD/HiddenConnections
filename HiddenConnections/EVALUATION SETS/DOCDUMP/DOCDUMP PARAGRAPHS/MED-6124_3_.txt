Special safety topics included cardiovascular risk, priapism, non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), impaired renal and hepatic function, drug interactions (i.e. nitrates, cytochrome P3A4 inhibitors, other ED therapies and α-blockers) and incorrect use. Results: Sildenafil was well tolerated at a dose of 50 or 100 mg in men with ED, overall, in those aged ≥ 65 years, and in those aged ≥ 75 years. Analyses of the databases did not reveal any causal link between sildenafil and cardiovascular events, or any new safety risks relating to cardiovascular events, priapism, NAION, hearing loss or drug interactions.
