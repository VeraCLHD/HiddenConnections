The pooled multivariable relative risks for suicide among persons in the highest quartile of intake of n-3 or n-6 PUFAs, relative to the lowest quartile, ranged from 1.08 to 1.46 for n-3 PUFAs (Ptrend = 0.11–0.52) and from 0.68 to 1.19 for n-6 PUFAs (Ptrend = 0.09–0.54). We did not find evidence that intake of n-3 PUFAs or fish lowered the risk of completed suicide.
