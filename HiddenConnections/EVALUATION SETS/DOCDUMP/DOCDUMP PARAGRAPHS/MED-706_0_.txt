Abstract OBJECTIVE: High concentrations of plasma deoxycholic acid (DCA) are found in human breast cyst fluid and it has been hypothesised that this may be related to risk of breast cancer. The aim of this pilot study was to ascertain whether plasma bile acid concentrations were greater in women with breast cancer. DESIGN: A case-control study comparing postmenopausal women with breast cancer with healthy controls was conducted.
