METHODS: Immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies to virulence-associated Yersinia outer membrane proteins (YOPs) were measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence of YOP IgA and IgG antibodies. RESULTS: Subjects with GD had a higher prevalence of YOP IgA (49%vs. 34%, P = 0.054) and YPO IgG (51%vs. 35%, P = 0.043) than the external controls.
