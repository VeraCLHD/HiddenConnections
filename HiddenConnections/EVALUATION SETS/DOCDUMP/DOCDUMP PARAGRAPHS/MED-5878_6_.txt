Methylation of BRCA1 promoter region was seen in 11/45 cases (24Â %). All 11 cases showing BRCA1 methylation had absent (eight cases) or reduced (three cases) BRCA1 protein expression. BRCA1 protein-negative tumours were more frequently basal marker-positive and ER-negative, highlighting the 'BRCAness' of sporadic breast cancer with loss of BRCA1 protein expression through promoter hypermethylation similar to hereditary breast cancer with BRCA1 mutations.
