The PRAL/100 g of each main food category was then calculated considering the frequency of the most represented (up to six) foods in the respective food group and the PRAL/100 g of each food. Subsequently the PRAL/100 g value for each main food category was adjusted for the standard serving size. Finally, according to the value of the adjusted PRAL value a score was assigned to each group of foods and named as LAKE (Load of Acid to Kidney Evaluation) score.
