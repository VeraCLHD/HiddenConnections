Abstract BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Consumption of antioxidant-rich foods may reduce the risk of stroke by inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) takes into account all antioxidants and the synergistic effects between them. We examined the association between dietary TAC and stroke incidence in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free women and in women with CVD history at baseline.
