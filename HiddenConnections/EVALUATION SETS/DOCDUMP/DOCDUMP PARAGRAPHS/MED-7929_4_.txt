The treatment significantly increased CAT activity, total glutathione and GSSG (p < 0.05). Significant gender*time*treatment interaction (p = 0.043) for total glutathione was found increasing at the end of the WM period in male but not changing in female. Total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio (p < 0.05) were lower in smokers.
