78% Al in the tea infusion passed through the 3000-Da ultrafilter; this percentage increased to more than 90% with the addition of gastric juice at pH 2.3, but then reduced to approximately 5% when the incubate was adjusted to pH 6.5. The breakdown of tea-derived polyphenols to low molecular weight phenols in vivo was measured using high-resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of ileostomy effluent, but there was no evidence of low molecular weight breakdown products from the polyphenols of ingested tea in this effluent. These results suggest that only a small proportion of Al in tea is potentially available for absorption throughout the small bowel.
