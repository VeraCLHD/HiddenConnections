The search was limited to literature in English and to human studies. The references of relevant articles and review articles were searched for citations not indexed in PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they measured levels of EPA, DHA, AA, total n-3 PUFAs, or total n-6 PUFAs from peripheral blood tissues in subjects with cognitive deficits (dementia or predementia syndrome) and elderly controls and were published in peer-reviewed journals.
