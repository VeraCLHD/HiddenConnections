Abstract The possible relation between child's early diet and risk of childhood leukemia has remained largely unexplored. The authors' objective was to determine what particular foods consumed early in life (first 2 years) are associated with risk of childhood leukemia in a 1995-2002 case-control study of a diverse California population. Dietary data were obtained from a questionnaire administered to the child's caregiver.
