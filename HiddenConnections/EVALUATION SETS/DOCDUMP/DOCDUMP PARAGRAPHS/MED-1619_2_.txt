After resting 20 min the subjects attempted to continue exercise either 1) after ingesting a placebo, 2) after ingesting glucose polymers (3 g/kg), or 3) when glucose was infused intravenously ("euglycemic clamp"). Placebo ingestion did not restore euglycemia or R. Plasma glucose increased (P less than 0.001) initially to approximately 5 mM and R rose (P less than 0.001) to approximately 0.83 with glucose infusion or carbohydrate ingestion. Plasma glucose and R then fell gradually to 3.9 +/- 0.3 mM and 0.81 +/- 0.01, respectively, after carbohydrate ingestion but were maintained at 5.1 +/- 0.1 mM and 0.83 +/- 0.01, respectively, by glucose infusion.
