Abstract Purpose We investigated whether caffeine, which transiently increases intraocular pressure (IOP) is associated with risk of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods We followed 79,120 women from 1980 and 42,052 men from 1986 to 2004 who were 40+ years old, did not have POAG, and reported receiving eye examinations. Information on caffeine consumption, potential confounders and POAG diagnoses were repeatedly updated in validated follow-up questionnaires.
