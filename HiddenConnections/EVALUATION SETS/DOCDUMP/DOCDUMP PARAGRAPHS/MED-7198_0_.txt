Abstract Little is known about the effects of diet after breast cancer diagnosis on survival. We prospectively examined the relation between post-diagnosis dietary factors and breast cancer and all-cause survival in women with a history of invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1987 and 1999 (at ages 20â€“79 years). Diet after breast cancer diagnosis was measured using a 126-item food frequency questionnaire.
