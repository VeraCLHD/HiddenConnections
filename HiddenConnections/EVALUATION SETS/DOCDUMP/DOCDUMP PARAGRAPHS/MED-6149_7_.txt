This difference in rate of occurrence of different symptoms is proposed to be caused by the different size of the arteries supplying different vascular beds that allow a larger vessel to better tolerate the same amount of plaque compared with a smaller one. According to this hypothesis, because penile arteries are smaller in diameter than coronary arteries, patients with ED will seldom have concomitant symptoms of CAD, whereas patients with CAD will frequently complain of ED. Available clinical evidence appears to support this hypothesis.
