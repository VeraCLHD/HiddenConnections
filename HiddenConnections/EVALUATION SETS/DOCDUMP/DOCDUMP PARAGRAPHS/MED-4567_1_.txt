To add further information on dietary patterns potentially associated to pancreatic cancer, we applied an exploratory principal component factor analysis on 28 major nutrients derived from an Italian case-control study. METHODS: Cases were 326 incident pancreatic cancer cases and controls 652 frequency-matched controls admitted to hospital for non-neoplastic diseases. Dietary information was collected through a validated and reproducible food frequency questionnaire.
