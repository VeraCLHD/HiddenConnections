Surveillance conducted by the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) has shown a recent increase in extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistance among Salmonella Heidelberg isolated from food animals at slaughter, retail meat, and humans. ESC resistance among Salmonella in the United States is usually mediated by a plasmid-encoded blaCMY Î²-lactamase. In 2009, we identified 47 ESC resistant blaCMY-positive Heidelberg isolates from humans (n=18), food animals at slaughter (n=16), and retail meats (n=13) associated with a spike in the prevalence of this serovar.
