The intra-subject night-day ratio varied up to 10.5 (mean 6.0) in young subjects (aged 20-35) and up to 5.4 (mean 2.8) in older individuals (age>65). The total amount of 24 h-aMT6s (range 7.5-58 microg) as well as the amount of aMT6s excreted during the nighttime period (range 327-6.074 ng/h) varied as much as 20-fold between individuals. Our data show an age-related decline in melatonin excretion in healthy subjects living in a natural environment.
