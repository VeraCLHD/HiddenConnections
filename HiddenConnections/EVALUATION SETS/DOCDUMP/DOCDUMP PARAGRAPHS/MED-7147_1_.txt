After passing the gut-blood barrier, the μ-opioid receptor agonist and antagonist peptides may become the new factors influencing various functions of the human organism. The aim of the conducted research was to determine the influence of μ-opioid receptor agonist peptides: human and bovine β-casomorphin-7 (h/bBCM-7) and antagonistic peptides: casoxin-6 and- D (CXN-6/D) on proliferation and cytokine secretion of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PBMCs proliferation was measured by the use of the BrdU test, which assesses the DNA synthesis activity and the WST-1 test which assesses the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes.
