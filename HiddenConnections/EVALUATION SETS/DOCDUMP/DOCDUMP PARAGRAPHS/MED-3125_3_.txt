Urine was collected during the sessions. Serum ionized calcium, phosphate, magnesium, intact parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium excretion were measured. The serum ionized calcium concentration increased significantly after ingesting cheese (P = 0.004, contrast analysis) or calcium salt (P = 0.05, contrast analysis) compared with the control session.
