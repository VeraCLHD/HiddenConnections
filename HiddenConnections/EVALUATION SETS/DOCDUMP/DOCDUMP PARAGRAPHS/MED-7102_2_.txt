Immunoassay of semen samples for CTX were not diagnostic, but the sensitivity and timing of the test employed may have precluded detection of small quantities of the toxin. We conclude that CTX may be present in the semen of men affected with ciguatera toxicity and be capable of producing symptomatology in both males and females during sexual intercourse.
