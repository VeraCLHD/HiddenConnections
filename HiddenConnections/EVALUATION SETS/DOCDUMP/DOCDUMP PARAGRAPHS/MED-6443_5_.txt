The results showed that the infection of M. persicae from Z. anhuiensis was highly rapid with little difference between aphid colonies maintained at 15 and 20 degrees C before being immersed in the fungicidal solution after exposure. The first 6-hour period after exposure was most crucial to successful infection of the fungus with the infection rate greatly depending on conidial dosages. It took < or = 1 h to infect > 50% of the aphids at a dosage of > 1.5 conida/mm2 and > 90% at > 50 conidia/mm2.
