We carried out a case-cohort study with 307 incident breast cancer cases and 300 subcohort members from the Sister Study cohort. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for the association between urinary levels of a major PGE2 metabolite (PGE-M) and breast cancer risk using Prenticeâ€™s pseudo-likelihood approach. Several lifestyle factors were associated with urinary levels of PGE-M: smoking, high saturated fat diet and obesity increased urinary PGE-M, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) decreased urinary PGE-M.
