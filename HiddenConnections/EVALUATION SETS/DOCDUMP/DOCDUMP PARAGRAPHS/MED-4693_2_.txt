RESULTS: Incidence rates per 1000 person-years for AD with CDR > or =0.5 were 3.24 (95% CI: 1.48-6.14) for those aged > or =65 years and 1.74 (95% CI: 0.84-3.20) for those aged > or =55 years. Standardized against the age distribution of the 1990 US Census, the overall incidence rate in those aged > or =65 years was 4.7 per 1000 person-years, substantially lower than the corresponding rate of 17.5 per 1000 person-years in the Monongahela Valley. CONCLUSION: These are the first AD incidence rates to be reported from the Indian subcontinent, and they appear to be among the lowest ever reported.
