Abstract OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence that intake of sour tea (Hibiscus sabdariffa) has hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects and may benefit patients suffering from metabolic disorders such as diabetes. The objective of the present study was to investigate the hypolipidemic effects of sour tea in patients with diabetes and compare them with those of black tea. DESIGN: In this sequential randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients with diabetes were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups: sour tea (ST) and black tea (BT).
