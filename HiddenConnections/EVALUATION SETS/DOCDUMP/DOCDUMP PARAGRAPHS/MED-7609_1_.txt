A total of 37 biopsy-proven symptomatic OLP patients were selected for this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. All subjects were divided into two groups to receive purslane (n = 20) or placebo (n = 17) for 3 months. Assessments were made at baseline, after 2 weeks and each month for 6 months, based on the visual analog scale (VAS) and clinical improvement including lesion type and size.
