Subgroup analysis among women with lowered renal function suggested whole soy consumption tended to improve markers of renal function relative to control. CONCLUSIONS: Six-month consumption of whole soy tended to have a modest improvement of renal function in prehypertensive postmenopausal women with lowered renal function. Future trials in subjects with more declined renal function are necessary.
