It has been proposed, mainly on the basis of observational studies, that nuts may provide superior satiation, may lead to reduced calorie consumption, and may decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes; but evidence from randomized, interventional studies is lacking. Twenty men and women with the metabolic syndrome participated in a randomized, double blind, cross-over study of walnut consumption. Subjects had two four-day admissions to the clinical research center where they were fed an iso-caloric diet.
