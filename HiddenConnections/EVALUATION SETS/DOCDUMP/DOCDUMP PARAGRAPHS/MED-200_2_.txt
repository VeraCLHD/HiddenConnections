We examined the relationship between serum methylglyoxal derivatives (sMG), and cognitive decline, in 267 non-demented elderly. Methods Tobit mixed regression models assessed the association of baseline sMG with cognitive decline in the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) over time, controlling for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, and years of education), cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes and presence of an APOE4 allele), and kidney function. sMG was assessed by ELISA.
