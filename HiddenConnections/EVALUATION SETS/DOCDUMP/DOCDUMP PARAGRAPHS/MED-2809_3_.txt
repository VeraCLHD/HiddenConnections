The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was administered at enrollment and at 8 weeks postpartum. Using regression models that included baseline EPDS scores and multiple confounders, we examined associations of colic and inconsolable crying with later maternal EPDS scores at 8 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Sixty mothers (10%) met the EPDS threshold for "possible depression" (score â‰¥9) at 8 weeks postpartum.
