OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between rice consumption and risk of CVD incidence and mortality in a Japanese population. DESIGN: This was a prospective study in 91,223 Japanese men and women aged 40-69 y in whom rice consumption was determined and updated from 3 self-administered food-frequency questionnaires, each 5 y apart. Follow-up for incidence was from 1990 to 2009 in cohort I and 1993 to 2007 in cohort II and for mortality was from 1990 to 2009 in cohort I and 1993 to 2009 in cohort II.
