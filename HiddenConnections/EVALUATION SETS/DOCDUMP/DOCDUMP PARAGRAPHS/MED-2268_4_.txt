Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects, generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Five studies were included in our analysis of the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened soda and CKD. The pooled RR of CKD in patients consuming sugar-sweetened soda was 1.58 (95% CI 1.00-2.49).
