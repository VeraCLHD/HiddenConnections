OBJECTIVE: (i) To investigate whether the erythrocyte catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total glutathione, reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and lipid peroxidation (LPO), and serum uric acid and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) are modified at increased CHD-risk individuals consuming walnut-enriched meat (WM), (ii) to evaluate whether these changes were influenced by basal serum cholesterol, body mass index or smoking habit. DESIGN: The study was a non blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial in which 22 volunteers (60% overweight and 40% obese) with increased CHD-risk were randomly assigned to receive WM or control meat (CM) during two different periods of 5 weeks. RESULTS: A significant interaction time*treatment (p < 0.05) was observed in all enzymes and substrates tested except HDL-C, uric acid and LPO.
