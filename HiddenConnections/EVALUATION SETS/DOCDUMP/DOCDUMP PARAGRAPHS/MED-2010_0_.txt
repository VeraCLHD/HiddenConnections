Abstract The number of obese people worldwide has escalated recently, revealing a complex picture of significant variations among nations and different profiles among adults and children, regions, and occupations. The commonly held causes of obesity-overeating and inactivity-do not explain the current obesity epidemic. There is evidence of a general decrease in food consumption by humans and a significant decline in their overall levels of physical activity.
