Dietary TAC was calculated using oxygen radical absorbance capacity values. Stroke cases were ascertained by linkage with the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry. RESULTS: During follow-up (September 1997 to December 2009), we identified 1322 stroke cases (988 cerebral infarctions, 226 hemorrhagic strokes, and 108 unspecified strokes) among CVD-free women and 1007 stroke cases (796 cerebral infarctions, 100 hemorrhagic strokes, and 111 unspecified strokes) among women with a CVD history.
