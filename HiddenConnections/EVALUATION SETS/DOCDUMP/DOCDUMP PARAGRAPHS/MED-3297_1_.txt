Each of these showed cardiomegaly, dilatation of right-side chambers, pulmonary hyperaemia and oedema of varying degree and extent; intrauterine death was considered to be due to P.C.D.A. In several further cases the ductus was also narrowed but not necessarily responsible for intrauterine death. This frequency suggests that P.C.D.A. is more common than might be surmised from very scanty documentation in the literature.
