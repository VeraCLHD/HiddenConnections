The two experimental diets will be compared with each other and with a control dietary pattern that is relatively low in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber, and has a fat and protein profile mirroring current consumption. The first experimental diet, arguably termed "ideal," is high in fruits, vegetables, whole cereal products, low-fat dairy products, fish, chicken, and lean meats designed to be low in saturated fat and cholesterol; moderately high in protein; and high in minerals and fiber. The second experimental diet tests the effect of fruits and vegetables alone.
