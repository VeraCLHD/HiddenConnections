Studies that reported odds ratios or hazard ratios comparing the risk of CKD in patients consuming significant amounts of either sugar-sweetened or artificially sweetened soda versus those who did not consume soda were included. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects, generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Five studies were included in our analysis of the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened soda and CKD.
