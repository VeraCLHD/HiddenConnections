Sera from all patients and 29 (34%) of 85 unaffected workplace controls (but none of 178 community controls) had a distinctive neural-reactive IgG; 75% of patients' sera contained an IgG specific to myelin basic protein. Seropositivity correlated directly with exposure risk in patients and controls. 17 patients required immunomodulatory therapies, six improved spontaneously, and one was lost to follow-up after exposure stopped.
