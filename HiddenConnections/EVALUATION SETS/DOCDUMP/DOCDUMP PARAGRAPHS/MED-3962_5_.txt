At the processing facility, C. difficile was isolated from the holding area, with a single carcass testing positive for the pathogen at preevisceration. MRSA was primarily isolated from nasal swabs with 8 (31%) carcasses testing positive at postbleed, which increased to 14 (54%) positive at postscald tanks. Only one carcass (sampled at postbleed) tested positive for MRSA, with no recovery of the pathogen from environmental samples taken.
