The proportion of patients with SE infection who reported recent international travel has decreased in recent years, whereas the proportion of chickens from which SE was isolated has increased. Similar molecular subtypes of SE are commonly isolated from humans and chickens. CONCLUSIONS: Most SE infections in the United States are acquired from domestic sources, and the problem is growing.
