Volunteers wore removable mandibular appliances carrying pre-demineralised human enamel slabs and consumed one of the test foods 7 times a day for 10 days. The test foods were apples, oranges, grapes, carrots, and tomatoes, consumed either whole (sugars located intrinsically) or as a juice (extrinsic or free sugars). Raisins containing 64% sugars, but intrinsic by definition, were also studied.
