DESIGN: Food consumption data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003-2006 and phytonutrient concentration data from US Department of Agriculture databases and the published literature were used to estimate energy-adjusted usual intakes. Student's t tests were used to compare mean energy-adjusted phytonutrient intakes between subpopulations who consumed recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables vs those who did not. Percentage contributions of each phytonutrient by food source were estimated for all adults.
