The present study attempted to isolate an influence of viscosity. At weekly intervals, 84 adults ingested 325-ml (220 kcal) shakes that were matched on weight, volume, temperature, energy, macronutrient content, energy density, rate of consumption, cognitive expectations, palatability, appearance, and requirements for mechanical processing, but varied in viscosity. Twice appetitive ratings were obtained over the subsequent 4 h, while all intake was proscribed, and twice ratings were kept until the first spontaneous eating occasion comprised of > or =100 kcal.
