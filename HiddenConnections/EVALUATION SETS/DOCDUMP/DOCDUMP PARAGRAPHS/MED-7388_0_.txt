Abstract BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improve on a vegetarian diet or supplementation with fish oil. We investigated the effects of both dietary measures, alone and in combination, on inflammation, fatty acid composition of erythrocyte lipids, eicosanoids, and cytokine biosynthesis in patients with RA. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with definitive RA were matched into two groups of 34 subjects each.
