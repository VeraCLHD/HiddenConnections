Abstract AIMS: To examine the acute effect of red wine and de-alcoholized red wine on endothelial function. METHODS AND RESULTS: High frequency ultrasound was used to measure blood flow and percentage brachial artery dilatation after reactive hyperaemia induced by forearm cuff occlusion in 12 healthy subjects, less than 40 years of age, without known cardiovascular risk factors. The subjects drank 250 ml of red wine with or without alcohol over 10 min according to a randomized procedure.
