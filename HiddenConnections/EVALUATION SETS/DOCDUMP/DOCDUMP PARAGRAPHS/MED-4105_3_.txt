OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify the association between an a priori-defined provegetarian FP and all-cause mortality. DESIGN: We followed 7216 participants (57% women; mean age: 67 y) at high cardiovascular risk for a median of 4.8 y. A validated 137-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire was administered at baseline and yearly thereafter.
