Fasting values and peak values at 15 min were significantly different (Dtvi: 15.1 +/- 4.9 cm/s vs. 18.9 +/- 5.9 cm/s, p = 0.04, Dtvi x HR: 862.2 +/- 261.5 cm/min vs. 1,174.2 +/- 307.5, p = 0.002). In contrast with the controls, despite postprandial increase in double product (HR x blood pressure), Dtvi and Dtvi x HR in the patient group decreased after food intake, with a nadir value at 45 min. Fasting values and nadir values at 45 min were significantly different (Dtvi: 24.0 +/- 19.6 cm/s vs. 19.3 +/- 17.1 cm/s, p < 0.001, Dtvi x HR: 1,449.6 +/- 1,044.0 cm/min vs. 1,273.4 +/- 1,000.9 cm/min, p = 0.002).
