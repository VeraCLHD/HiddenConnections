At baseline and after each intervention, anthropometrical parameters, BP and plasma NO were measured. Systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly after the dealcoholized red wine intervention and these changes correlated with increases in plasma NO. CONCLUSIONS: Dealcoholized red wine decreases systolic and diastolic BP.
