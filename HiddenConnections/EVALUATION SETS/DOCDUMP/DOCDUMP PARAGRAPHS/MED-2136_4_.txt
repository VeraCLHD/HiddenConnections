It also deals with the factors responsible for protein misfolding and aggregation. This article describes some of the consequences of such behavior particularly in the context of neurodegenerative conformational diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other non-neurodegenerative conformational diseases such as cancer and cystic fibrosis etc. This will encourage a more proactive approach to the early diagnosis of conformational diseases and nutritional counseling for patients.
