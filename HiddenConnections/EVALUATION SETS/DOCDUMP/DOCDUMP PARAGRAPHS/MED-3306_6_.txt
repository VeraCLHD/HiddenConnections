Results The prevalence of SR was 19.6% and MDE was 17.0%. Higher likelihood of SR was observed among women with higher arachidonic acid [AA (20:4n-6): OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.07] and adrenic acid [AdA (22:4 n-6): OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.01-2.04], and for MDE: AA [OR=1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.10], and AdA [OR=1.59, 95% CI 1.09-2.32], per standard deviation of fatty acid, in adjusted logistic regressions. Conclusion Higher serum status of AA and AdA, two omega-6 fatty acids, were associated with greater likelihood of SR and MDE among pregnant Brazilian women independently of confounding variables.
