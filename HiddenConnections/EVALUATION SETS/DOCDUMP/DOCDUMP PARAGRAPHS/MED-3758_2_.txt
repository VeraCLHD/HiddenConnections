The mean changes of DNA-p/min in gastric aspirates after intragastric infusions of 2 and 4 g ginger were -1.37 +/- 2.3 and 6.74 +/- 3.06 respectively, which were not significant statistically. However, 6 g ginger given intragastrically showed a mean significant increase in DNA-p/min of 3.23 +/- 1.02 (P less than 0.05). Intragastric infusion of 0.3 g uncooked garlic showed a non-significant increase in DNA-p/min of 0.307 +/- 0.59.
