SUBJECTS: A total of 19 lean, mean age 33±13 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 23.2±2.2 kg m(-2) and 12 OW/OB, mean age 39.5±3 years, mean BMI 28±2.6 kg m(-2), subjects participated in the study, which measured taste thresholds for C18:1, fat perception and hedonic ratings for regular (RF) and lowered-fat (LF) foods before, and following consumption of a high- and low-fat diet. RESULTS: Consumption of the low-fat diet increased taste sensitivity to C18:1 among lean and OW/OB subjects (P<0.05) and increased the subjects ability to perceive small differences in the fat content of custard (P=0.05). Consumption of the high-fat diet significantly decreased taste sensitivity to C18:1 among lean subjects (P<0.05), with no change in sensitivity among OW/OB persons (P=0.609).
