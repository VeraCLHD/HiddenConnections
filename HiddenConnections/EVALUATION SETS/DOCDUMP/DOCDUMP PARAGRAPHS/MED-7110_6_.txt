By contrast, this occurred for only 27% of visits to pharmacies (p < 0.01). Conversely, on two thirds of visits to pharmacies, staff gave advice considered to be fairly accurate or accurate, but this seldom occurred in HFS (68% vs. 7%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of information provided in HFS in response to questions has little scientific support.
