Plasmid multi-locus sequence typing (pMLST) of the IncI1-blaCMY plasmids showed that 27 (65.8%) were sequence type (ST) 12, the most common ST among blaCMY-IncI1 plasmids from Heidelberg isolated from humans. Ten plasmids had a new ST profile, ST66, a type very similar to ST12. This work showed that the 2009 increase in ESC resistance among Salmonella Heidelberg was caused mainly by the dissemination of blaCMY on IncI1 and IncA/C plasmids in a variety of genetic backgrounds, and likely not the result of clonal expansion.
