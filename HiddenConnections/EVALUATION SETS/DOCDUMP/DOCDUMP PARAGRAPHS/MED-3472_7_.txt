An inverse relation was found between habitual caffeine intake and AF risk (P for overall trend = 0.015; P for nonlinearity = 0.27) in dose-response meta-analysis and the incidence of AF decreased by 6% (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99) for every 300 mg/d increment in habitual caffeine intake. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that caffeine consumption causes or contributes to AF. Habitual caffeine consumption might reduce AF risk.
