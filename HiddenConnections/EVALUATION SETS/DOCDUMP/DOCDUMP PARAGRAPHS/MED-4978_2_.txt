SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 81 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups for 4 weeks. The groups received either 10 g/d BSP (n=27), 5 g/d BSP (n=29) or placebo (n=25). Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were measured at baseline and at 4 weeks after treatment.
