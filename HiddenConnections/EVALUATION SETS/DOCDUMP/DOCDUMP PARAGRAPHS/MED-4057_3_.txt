Colloidal oatmeal lotion demonstrates multiple anti-inflammatory properties with known effects on arachidonic acid, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha pathways, along with an excellent side-effect profile. Treatment with colloidal oatmeal was applied to 11 patients with a rash induced by cetuximab, erlotinib, panitumumab and sorafenib. Of the 10 assessable patients, 6 had complete response and 4 partial response, giving a response rate of 100% with no associated toxicities.
