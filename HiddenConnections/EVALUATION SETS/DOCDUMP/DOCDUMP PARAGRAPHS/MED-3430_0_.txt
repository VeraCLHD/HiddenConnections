Abstract Dry eye disease (DED) treatment is an area of increasing complexity, with the emergence of several new treatment agents in recent years. Evaluation of the efficacy of these agents is limited by heterogeneity in outcomes definition and the small number of comparative studies. We provide a systematic review of clinical trials (CTs) related to DED treatment and a critical appraisal of CT public databases.
