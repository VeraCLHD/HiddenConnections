Randomization was halted after the fourth CMT death, as planned before initiating the study, and the next 20 babies were treated with ECMO (phase II). Of the 20, 19 survived. All three treatment groups (CMT and ECMO in phase I and ECMO, phase II) were comparable in severity of illness and mechanical ventilator support.
