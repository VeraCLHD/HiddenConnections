In particular, the effect of diets consisting of or excluding animal products that have elevated IGF content (e.g., milk) was considered. RESULTS: Vegan women, who exclude dairy products from their diets, have a twinning rate which is one-fifth that of vegetarians and omnivores. CONCLUSION: The results reported here support the proposed IGF model of dizygotic twinning.
