The purity of the microbial fraction was demonstrated by Gram and plant stains and by scanning electron microscopy. Microscopic counts of the bacteria in each fraction of the stool showed that the microbial fraction contained 95% of the total bacteria. Chemical analysis of the component sugars indicated 6-7% possible contamination by non-bacterial polysaccharides.
