The mean values of biogenic amines (tryptamine, 2-phenyl-ethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, agmatine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine and spermine) determined in 23 Doenjang samples were found to be 18.37, 82.03, 70.84, 34.24, 47.32, 26.79, 126.66, 74.41 and 244.36 mg%, respectively. The findings of this study enhance the safety of not only Doenjang but other salted and/or fermented food products. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
