MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five women with a normal sense of smell were exposed to saffron odor for 20 min. Saliva samples were then collected to measure levels of cortisol (C), testosterone (T) and 17-Î² estradiol (E) by enzyme immunoassay, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered as a psychological test. RESULTS: Saffron odor significantly decreased C levels after short-term stimulation (20 min) in both follicular and luteal phases.
