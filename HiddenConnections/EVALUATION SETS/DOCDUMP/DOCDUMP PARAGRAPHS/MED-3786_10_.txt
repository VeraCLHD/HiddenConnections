MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs assessing different intervention and control diets in 192 patients (97 randomised to intervention diet; 95 to control diet) with different types of malignancies. Co-interventions (e.g. protective environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, central venous catheter care, oral care, hygiene practices and colony-stimulating factors) and outcome definitions also differed between studies. In all included studies it was standard policy to give empirical antibiotics (and sometimes also antimycotics) to (some of) the patients diagnosed with an infection.
