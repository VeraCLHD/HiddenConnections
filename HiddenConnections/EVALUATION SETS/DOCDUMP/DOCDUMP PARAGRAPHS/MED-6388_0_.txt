Abstract The etiology of bacterial vaginosis is unknown, and there are no long-term therapies for preventing this frequently recurring condition. Vaginal douching has been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis in observational studies. However, this association may be due to confounding by indicationâ€”that is, confounding by women douching in response to vaginal symptoms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
