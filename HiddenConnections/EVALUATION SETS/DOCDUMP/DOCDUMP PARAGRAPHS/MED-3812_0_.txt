Abstract Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in most developed nations and is rapidly increasing in prevalence in developing countries. Death rates from cardiovascular disease exceed 1 million annually in the United States and account for the largest disease-related cost to health with total costs estimated to exceed $120 billion per annum. Many dietary factors, including total and saturated fat consumption, fruit and vegetable intake and dietary fiber, have been shown to contribute to risk for CHD.
