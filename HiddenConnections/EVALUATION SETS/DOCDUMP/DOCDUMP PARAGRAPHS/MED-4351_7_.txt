The ratio of NNK:nicotine on the exposed cloth was 10-fold higher than that in aerosol samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the majority of the PAHs, nicotine, cotinine and tobacco-specific nitrosamines that are released during smoking in homes and public places deposit on room surfaces. These data give an estimate of the potential for accumulation of carcinogens in thirdhand cigarette smoke.
