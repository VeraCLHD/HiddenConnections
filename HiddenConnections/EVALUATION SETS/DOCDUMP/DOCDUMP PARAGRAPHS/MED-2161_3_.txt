In addition, UVA enhanced dermal S-nitrosothiols 2.3-fold, and the subfraction of dermal S-nitrosoalbumin 2.9-fold. In vivo, in healthy volunteers creamed with a skin cream containing isotopically labeled (15)N-nitrite, whole body UVA irradiation (20 J/cm(2)) induced significant levels of (15)N-labeled S-nitrosothiols in the blood plasma of light exposed subjects, as detected by cavity leak out spectroscopy. Furthermore, whole body UVA irradiation caused a rapid, significant decrease, lasting up to 60 minutes, in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of healthy volunteers by 11+/-2% at 30 minutes after UVA exposure.
