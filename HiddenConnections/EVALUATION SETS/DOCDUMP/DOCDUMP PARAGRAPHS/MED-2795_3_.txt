METHOD: In a blinded, randomized, cross-over study, male subjects on a low-carotenoid diet consumed 330 ml/day of either tomato juice (37.0 mg/day lycopene) or carrot juice (27.1 mg/day beta-carotene and 13.1 mg/day alpha-carotene) for 2 weeks with a 2-week depletion period after juice intervention. Immune status was assessed by measuring lytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells, secretion of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha), and proliferation by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Juice consumption resulted in relatively fast responses in plasma carotenoid concentrations (p < 0.0002) which were not accompanied by concomitant changes in immune functions.
