Results Critical reflection with a cultural lens allows cognitive attachments to materialism, reductionism, mechanistic thought, na√Øve realism, control over nature and pervasive subject-object dichotomies between mind and matter, scientist and nature, experience and reality, among many others to become more available for critical consideration. Culturally diverse food and health understandings otherwise dismissed as "unscientific" or held in abeyance gain value as alternative assumptive frameworks and cognitive models that can be temporarily inhabited for further intercultural reflection and insight. Conclusion Critical reflection with a cultural lens allows reconsideration of nutrition science in light of its culturally specific origin and foundation.
