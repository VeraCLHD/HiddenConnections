Zeranol (Ralgro) is a nonsteroidal agent with estrogenic activity that is used as a growth promoter in the U.S. beef and veal industry. To determine whether zeranol and estradiol-17beta play a role in the neoplastic transformation of human breast and to compare the estrogenic potency of zeranol to that of estradiol-17beta in human breast, we treated human breast epithelial cell MCF-10A with different doses of zeranol or estradiol-17beta for 10 repeated treatment cycles. By utilizing the doubling time assay, soft agar assay, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, we showed that 10 repeated estradiol-17beta or zeranol treatment cycles to MCF-10A cells decrease the doubling time of the cells by 30 to 40% and stimulate colony formation in soft agar and induce estrogen receptor beta (ER-beta) mRNA expression, all of which are not dose related in our tested dose range.
