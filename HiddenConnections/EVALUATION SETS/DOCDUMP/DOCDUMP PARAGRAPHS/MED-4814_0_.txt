Abstract A number of natural compounds with inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis have been identified from our diet. Several studies have documented the cancer-preventive activity of a significant number of isothiocyanates (ITCs), the majority of which occur in plants, especially in Cruciferous vegetables. The most characterized ITC is sulforaphane (SFN).
