The radiation antagonistic potential of zingerone was assessed by alkaline comet, cytokinesis-block micronucleus, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species inhibition assays. Treatment of lymphocytes with zingerone (10Î¼g/ml) prior exposure to 2Gy gamma radiation resulted in a significant reduction of frequency of micronuclei as compared to the control set of cells evaluated by cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay. Similarly, treatment of lymphocytes with zingerone prior to radiation exposure showed significant decrease in the DNA damage as assessed by comet parameters, such as percent tail DNA and Olive tail moment.
