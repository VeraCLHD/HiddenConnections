The prevalence of all major CVD was much higher in 1991 (19.1%) as compared with 1960 (8.8%) (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the prevalence of CHD RF and CVD was much higher in 1991 than in 1960 for Cretan men of the same age group. This higher prevalence seems to be related to dietary and life-style changes that have taken place in Crete during the last thirty years.
