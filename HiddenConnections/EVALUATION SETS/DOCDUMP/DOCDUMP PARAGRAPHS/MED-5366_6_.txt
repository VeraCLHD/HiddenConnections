No significant increase in resorptions was seen in the Osborne-Mendel strain, but the Charles River strain at IBT showed a significant increase in litters with two or more resorptions after dams had been given 200 mg/kg at 0-19 days of gestation. The NCTR study on the Charles River strain also showed an increase in the same parameter for the same dose level and in addition showed a significant increase in the percentage of resorptions per litter. It was concluded that because of the inherent variation and the absence of an increase in abnormalities or other indications of embryotoxicity, there is reason to doubt that this effect is either biologically significant or reproducible.
