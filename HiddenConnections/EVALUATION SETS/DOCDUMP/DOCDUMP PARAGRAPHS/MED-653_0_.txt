Abstract OBJECTIVE: In contrast to coeliac disease (CD), the mechanism behind non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is unclear. The aims of the study were to measure the presence of somatization, personality traits, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life in NCGS individuals compared with CD patients and healthy controls, and to compare the response to gluten challenge between NCGS and CD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 22 CD patients and 31 HLA-DQ2+ NCGS patients without CD, all on a gluten-free diet.
