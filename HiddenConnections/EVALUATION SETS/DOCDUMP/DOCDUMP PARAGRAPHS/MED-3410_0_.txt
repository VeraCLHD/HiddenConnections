Abstract Bile acids were first proposed as carcinogens in 1939. Since then, accumulated evidence has linked exposure of cells of the gastrointestinal tract to repeated high physiologic levels of bile acids as an important risk factor for gastrointestinal cancers. High exposure to bile acids may occur in a number of settings, but most importantly, is prevalent among individuals who have a high dietary fat intake.
