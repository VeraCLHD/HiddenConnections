Inhibition of adhesion to the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) beads was quantified using fluorescent-labelled cells. The MIC for S. mutans was determined by colony counting on agar plates containing VcPP. The ability of VcPP to inhibit glucan synthesis by three distinct recombinant glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) was assessed by quantifying the production of water-soluble and -insoluble polysaccharides in bacterial cultures.
