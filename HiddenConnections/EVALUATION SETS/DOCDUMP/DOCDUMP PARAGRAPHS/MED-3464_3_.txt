We confirmed 1,011 incident POAG cases with medical record review. Cohort-specific and pooled analyses across cohorts were conducted to calculate multivariable rate ratios (RR). Results Compared with daily intake of < 150 mg, the pooled multivariable RRs were 1.05 [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.89–1.25] for consuming 150–299 mg, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.99–1.43] for 300 – 449 mg/day, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.89–1.43] for 450–559 mg and 1.17 [95% CI, 0.90, 1.53] for 600+ mg+ [p for trend = 0.11].
