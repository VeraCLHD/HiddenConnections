Abstract INTRODUCTION: Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are the first line drugs for treatment of erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil (Viagra(R)), tadalafil (Cialis(R)), and vardenafil (Levitra(R)) are from the same class of drugs that inhibit PDE5. Transient visual symptoms such as change in color perception and increased light sensitivity are well-known adverse effects of these drugs and occur in 3-11% of sildenafil users.
