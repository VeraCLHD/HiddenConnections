The mean time interval between the onset of ED and CAD was 38.8 months (range 1-168). There was no significant difference in terms of risk factor distribution and clinical and angiographic characteristics between patients with the onset of ED before vs. after CAD diagnosis. Interestingly, all patients with type I diabetes and ED actually developed sexual dysfunction before CAD onset (p<0.001).
