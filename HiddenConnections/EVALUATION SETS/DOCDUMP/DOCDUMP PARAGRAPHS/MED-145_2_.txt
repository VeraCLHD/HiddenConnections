DESIGN: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for all prospective cohort studies published up to March 2013 with RRs and 95% CIs for outcomes of interest. A random-effects model was used to pool risk estimates across studies. RESULTS: In 31 reports from 18 prospective studies, there were 12,655 type 2 diabetes, 8862 CVD, 6623 ischemic heart disease (IHD), 6487 stroke, and 48,818 mortality cases.
