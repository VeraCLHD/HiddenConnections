Within individuals, NAF and serum levels of E2 (rs=0.37; p<0.001) but not E1S (rs=0.004; p=0.97) were correlated. E2 and E1S in NAF and serum were strongly associated (rs=0.78 and rs=0.48; p<0.001). Conclusions Soy foods in amounts consumed by Asians did not significantly modify estrogen levels in NAF and serum.
