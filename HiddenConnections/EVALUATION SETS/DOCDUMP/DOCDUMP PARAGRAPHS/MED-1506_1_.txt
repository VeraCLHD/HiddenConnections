The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of kiwifruit on sleep patterns, including sleep onset, duration, and quality. In this study, we applied a free-living, self-controlled diet design. Twenty-four subjects (2 males, 22 females) 20 to 55 years of age consumed 2 kiwifruits 1 hour before bedtime nightly for 4 weeks.
