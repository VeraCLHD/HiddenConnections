Further we analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the expression of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1Î² by RT-PCR on HeLa cells. RESULTS: In the present study, sulforaphane was found to induce dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile. Additionally, a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine was found to increase the growth inhibition in a synergistic manner in HeLa cells compared to the individual drugs.
