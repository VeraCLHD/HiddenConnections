Abstract A study was performed to investigate the antimutagenic effect of broccoli flower head by the Ames Salmonella reverse mutation assay. Broccoli flower head being the most highly edible part in the plant was analysed for its antimutagenic effect. Without isolating the phytomolecules, the crude ethanol extract of broccoli flower head was tested for suppressing the mutagenic effect induced by certain chemical mutagens.
