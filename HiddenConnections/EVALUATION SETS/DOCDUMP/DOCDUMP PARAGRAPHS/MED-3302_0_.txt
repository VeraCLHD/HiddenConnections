Abstract OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that maternal restriction of polyphenol-rich foods (PRF), which, like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the third trimester, reverse fetal ductal constriction (DC). STUDY DESIGN: An open clinical trial of 51 third trimester fetuses with DC with no history of NSAID intake was designed. All mothers were submitted to a food frequency questionnaire and were oriented to withdrawl PRF, being reassessed after 3 weeks.
