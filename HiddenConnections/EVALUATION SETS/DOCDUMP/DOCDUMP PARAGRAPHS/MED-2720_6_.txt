Their mean FMD was 2.6±2.3%. Daily intake of total allium vegetable (r=0.36, P<0.01) and garlic (r=0.34, P<0.01) significantly correlated with FMD. Using the median daily allium intake as cut-off (3.37g/day), patients with a low allium intake <3.37g/day was noted to have a lower FMD compared to those with a normal allium intake (2.1±2.1% versus 3.0±2.4%, P<0.05).
