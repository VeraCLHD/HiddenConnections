HN and HA induced DNA damage was confirmed by comet tail formation. Lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS) and protein oxidation marker (PCC) were significantly elevated in HN and HA treated groups. Enzymic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were slightly decreased in their activities compared to control (untreated HT-29 cells).
