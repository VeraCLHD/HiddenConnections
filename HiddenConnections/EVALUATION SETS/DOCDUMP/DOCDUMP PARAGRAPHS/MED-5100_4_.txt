In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that anti-Gal may contribute to Graves' disease (GD) pathogenesis by stimulation of the thyrocytes of patients with this autoimmune disorder. Anti-Gal binding and stimulatory effects were assessed in primary thyrocyte cultures. Anti-Gal specifically bound to GD thyrocytes and induced an increase in cAMP synthesis, 125I uptake, and DNA synthesis in these cells.
