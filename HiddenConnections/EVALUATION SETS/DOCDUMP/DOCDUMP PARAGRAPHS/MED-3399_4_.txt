Baseline-adjusted carotene and retinyl ester (R-ester) area-under-curve (AUC) responses in the triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fraction (0-8.5 h) were determined using HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The masses of absorbed beta C, alpha-carotene (alpha C) and R-ester were estimated by comparing their AUC values with that of deuterium-labeled retinyl ester (d(4)-R-ester), assuming the latter represented 80% of the d(4)-RA reference dose. Absorption of beta C and alpha C was approximately twofold greater from carrot puree than from boiled-mashed carrots, whereas the retinol yield was only marginally (P = 0.11) influenced by treatment.
