Multivariate regression models controlled for age, BMI, race/ethnicity, geography, season, physical activity, diet and cancer treatments demonstrated that stage of disease independently predicted serum [25(OH)D] (p=0.02). Conclusion In these breast cancer survivors, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was high. Clinicians might consider monitoring vitamin D status in breast cancer patients, together with appropriate treatments, if necessary.
