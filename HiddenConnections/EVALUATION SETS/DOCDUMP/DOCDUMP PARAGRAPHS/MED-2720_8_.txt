Using the median daily allium intake as cut-off (3.37g/day), patients with a low allium intake <3.37g/day was noted to have a lower FMD compared to those with a normal allium intake (2.1±2.1% versus 3.0±2.4%, P<0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, multi-variate analysis identified that daily allium vegetable (B=0.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.02, 0.09, P<0.01) and garlic (B=0.07, 95% confidence interval: 0.02, 0.12, P<0.01) intake, but not onions, Chinese chives and shallots were independent predictors for changes in FMD in patients with ISS. CONCLUSIONS: Daily garlic intake is an independent predictor of endothelial function in patients with ISS and may play a role in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic events.
