Immune-mediators with pro-inflammatory activity (IL-17, EOTAXIN and IFNγ) were significantly (P<0.01) stimulated by all strains, followed by IL-1b>IP-10>IL-6>MIP1α. Stimulation of IL-12, IL-2 and IL-7 was strain dependent. Only a few strains increased the synthesis of cytokines with anti-inflammatory activity.
