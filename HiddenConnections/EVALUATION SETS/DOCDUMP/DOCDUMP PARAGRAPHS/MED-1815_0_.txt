Abstract PURPOSE: To quantitate neuroanatomic parameters in healthy volunteers and to compare the values with normative values from postmortem studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 116 volunteers aged 19 months to 80 years were analyzed with semiautomated procedures validated by means of comparison with manual tracings. Volumes measured included intracranial space, whole brain, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
