Abstract The potential for chemical intervention (chemoprevention) as a means of halting or delaying the process of carcinogenesis is assessed as a strategy for reducing the incidence of human cancer. The process of carcinogenesis is dissected into its constituent steps, thereby exposing sites for intervention. These sites are then critically discussed with regard to the existence of chemicals active at these sites using data gained from the laboratory and from epidemiological studies, intrinsic problems or advantages associated with intervention at specific sites in the carcinogenic process, and practical aspects of intervention in humans.
