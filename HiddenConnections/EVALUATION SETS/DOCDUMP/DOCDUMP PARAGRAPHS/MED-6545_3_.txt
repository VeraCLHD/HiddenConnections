RESULTS: Cinnamon ingestion reduced total plasma glucose responses (AUC) to oral glucose ingestion [-13% and -10% for OGTT(cin) (p < 0.05) and OGTT(cin12hpre) (p < 0.05), respectively], as well as improving insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin sensitivity index measures based on Matsuda's model in both OGTT(cin) (p < 0.05) and OGTT(cin12hpre) (p < 0.05) trials compared with OGTT(control). CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate that cinnamon spice supplementation may be important to in vivo glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in humans, and not only are its effects immediate, they also appear to be sustained for 12 h.
