Endothelial function can be measured noninvasively by using brachial artery ultrasound. A variety of factors associated with atherosclerosis also impair endothelial function. Some of these factors are lipoproteins such as various forms of low-density lipoproteins, postprandial chylomicron remnants, fasting triglyceride-rich particles, and free fatty acids.
