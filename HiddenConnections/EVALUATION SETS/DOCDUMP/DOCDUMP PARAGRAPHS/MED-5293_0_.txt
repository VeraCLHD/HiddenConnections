Abstract Large differences exist between human populations in the frequency of colonic cancer. Epidemiological evidence indicates that these differences are strongly influenced by country of residence, and a negative correlation has been found between the fiber content of the diet and frequency of colonic cancer. This has prompted the hypothesis that high-fiber diets are in some way protective.
