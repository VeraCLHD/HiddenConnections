Present results have demonstrated that MCF 7 and T 47 D cells exhibited differential sensitivity to TPL, which seems to be dependant on their p53 status. Inhibition of anti-proliferative ability of TPL by antioxidants suggests a role for TPL induced ROS in the induction of apoptosis. It is concluded that p53 status of cancer cells formed an important factor in predicting the response of cancer cells to prooxidant drugs.
