RESULTS: Infants fed control formula had significantly poorer visual evoked potential visual acuity at 12 mo of age than did infants who received any of the DHA-supplemented formulas (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in visual evoked potential visual acuity between the 3 amounts of DHA supplementation for either site at any age tested. CONCLUSIONS: DHA supplementation of infant formula at 0.32% of total fatty acids improves visual acuity.
