Diet was assessed at baseline by using a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire and updated approximately every 4 y. In â‰¤30 y of follow-up, we identified 1873 incident hip fractures. We computed RRs for hip fractures by the amount of soda consumption by using Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for potential confounders.
