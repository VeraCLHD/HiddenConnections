Case Presentation We successfully used a combined ESD/EMR technique for huge rectal laterally spreading tumors (LSTs). ESD was used for circumferential resection of 2/3 of the lesion followed by piecemeal resection (2-3 pieces) of the central part of the tumour. In all three patients we obtained the complete dissection of the polyp and the complete histological evaluation in absence of complications and recurrence at 6 months' follow up.
