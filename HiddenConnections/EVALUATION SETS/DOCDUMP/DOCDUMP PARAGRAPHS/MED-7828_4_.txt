OBJECTIVE: To compare the total antioxidant content of natural sweeteners as alternatives to refined sugar. DESIGN: The ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay was used to estimate total antioxidant capacity. Major brands of 12 types of sweeteners as well as refined white sugar and corn syrup were sampled from retail outlets in the United States.
