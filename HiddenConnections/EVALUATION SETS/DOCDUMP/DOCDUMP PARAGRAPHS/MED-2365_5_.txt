The increased risk associated with a higher baseline resting heart rate is most obvious in patients with previous macrovascular complications (fully adjusted HR for death 1.79 for upper [mean 91 bpm] v lowest [mean 58 bpm] fifth of resting heart rate in this sub-group, 95% CI 1.28,2.50, p<0.001). Conclusions Among patients with type 2 diabetes, a higher resting heart rate is associated with increased risk of death and cardiovascular complications. It remains unclear whether a higher heart rate directly mediates the increased risk or is a marker for other factors that determine a poor outcome.
