We investigated the long-term outcome of undiagnosed CD and whether the prevalence of undiagnosed CD has changed during the past 50 years. Methods This study included 9,133 healthy young adults at Warren Air Force Base (sera were collected between 1948 and 1954) and 12,768 sex-matched subjects from 2 recent cohorts from Olmsted County, Minnesota, with either similar years of birth (n=5,558) or age at sampling (n=7,210) to that of the Air Force cohort. Sera were tested for tissue transglutaminase and, if abnormal, for endomysial antibodies.
