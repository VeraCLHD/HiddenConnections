The half-life was longer for meals of larger volume; at 37 degrees C this was statistically significant: 200 ml: t 1/2 7.6 +/- 2.1 min; 500 ml: t 1/2 15.3 +/- 2.8 min; P less than 0.01. 5. There was a significant positive correlation between the 5 min volume and the subsequent half-life of emptying for all meals except 200 ml at 12 degrees C, suggesting that resting gastric muscle tone affects both phases of gastric emptying.
