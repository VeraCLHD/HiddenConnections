Abstract The marked age-related decline in serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) has suggested that a deficiency of these steroids may be causally related to the development of a series of diseases that are generally associated with aging. Postulated consequences of low DHEA levels include insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, reduction of the immune defence system as well as psychosocial problems such as depression and a general deterioration in the sensation of well-being and cognitive function. Clinically, the spectrum of women that would benefit from DHEA therapy is not clearly defined and nor is the dosage of hormone treatment.
