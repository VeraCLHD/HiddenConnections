We evaluated differences in the prevalence of neurocysticercosis between patients and controls. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 1017 patients with primary headache and 31 of 1687 controls had neurocysticercosis (4.7% vs 1.8%, p < 0.0001). Calcified parenchymal brain cysticerci were more frequent among patients with primary headache than in those with cerebrovascular disease (4.7% vs 1%, p < 0.001), degenerative disorders of the CNS (4.7% vs 2.4%, p < 0.05), and head trauma (4.7% vs 2.3%, p < 0.05).
