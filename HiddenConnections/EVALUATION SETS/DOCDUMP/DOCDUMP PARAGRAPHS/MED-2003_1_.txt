Visceral fat is associated in its own right with a set of metabolic abnormalities, including non insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemias. States of marked hypercortisolaemia, for example Cushing's syndrome, lead to the preferential accumulation of visceral fat. Since melancholic depression is known to be associated with elevated plasma Cortisol levels, this review explores whether depressed patients are prone to excess visceral fat storage, with the subsequent risk of developing the associated metabolic disturbances.
