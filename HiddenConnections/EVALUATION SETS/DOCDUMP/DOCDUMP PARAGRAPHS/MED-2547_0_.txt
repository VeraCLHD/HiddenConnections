Abstract BACKGROUND: Blood lead levels (BLLs) less than 1.21 µmol/L (<25 µg/dL) among adults are considered acceptable by current national standards. Lead toxicity can lead to gouty arthritis (gout), but whether the low lead exposure in the contemporary general population confers risk for gout is not known. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether BLLs within the range currently considered acceptable are associated with gout.
