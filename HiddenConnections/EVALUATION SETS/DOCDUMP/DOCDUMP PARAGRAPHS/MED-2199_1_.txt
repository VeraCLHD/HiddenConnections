It is unclear when vitamin D supplementation should be prescribed. OBJECTIVE: We assess the evidence that guides clinical decision-making on supplementation with vitamin D following a vitamin D test result. DISCUSSION: Vitamin D assays are inconsistent and inaccurate and there is weak evidence around the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) that is optimal.
