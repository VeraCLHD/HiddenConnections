The two spices similarly enhanced the bioaccessibility of zinc from the food grains, the extent of increase in cereals ranging from 10.4% to 159.4% and in pulses from 9.8% to 49.8%. Thus, both garlic and onion were evidenced here to have a promoting influence on the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grains. This novel information has the potential application in evolving a food-based strategy to improve the bioavailability of trace minerals and hence contributes to the human health benefit.
