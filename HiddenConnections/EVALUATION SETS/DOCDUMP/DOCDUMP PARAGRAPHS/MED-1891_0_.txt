Abstract The rationale for the present study was that temporarily reversing the urbanization process in diabetic Aborigines should improve all aspects of their carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that are linked to insulin resistance. Ten full-blood, diabetic Aborigines from the Mowanjum Community (Derby, Western Australia) agreed to be tested before and after living for 7 wk as hunter-gatherers in their traditional country in north-western Australia. They were middle aged (53.9 +/- 1.8 yr) and overweight (81.9 +/- 3.4 kg), and all lost weight steadily over the 7-wk period (average, 8 kg).
