Men (n=1218) and women (n=907) ≥60y were included from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008. Nutrient intake from 2–24h recalls was used to calculate net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and potential renal acid load (PRAL) (mEq/d). PRAL was calculated from dietary calcium (PRALdiet) and diet + supplemental calcium (PRALtotal).
