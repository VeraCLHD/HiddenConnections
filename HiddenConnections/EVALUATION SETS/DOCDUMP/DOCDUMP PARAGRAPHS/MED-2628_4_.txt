Nonsmoking men (n = 142) and women (n = 225) aged 45-70 y were randomly assigned to treatment for 12 mo; 312 subjects completed the intervention. RESULTS: Compliance with the intervention was corroborated by significant dose-dependent increases in the proportions of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte lipids and a 16.5% reduction in serum triacylglycerol concentrations with 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs/d. FMD was lower in men than in women (P < 0.0001) and decreased with age (ρ = 0.270, P < 0.001) but was not significantly (P = 0.781) related to n-3 LC-PUFA intake.
