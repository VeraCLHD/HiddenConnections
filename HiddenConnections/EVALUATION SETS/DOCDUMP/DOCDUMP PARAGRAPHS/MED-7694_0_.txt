Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore the role of iron physiology in the brain of healthy adults and review how increased brain iron deposition has been associated with common neurodegenerative diseases that affect the elderly. RECENT FINDINGS: Because iron plays a role in oxygen transportation, myelin synthesis, neurotransmitter production, and electron transfers, it serves as a crucial cofactor in normal central nervous metabolism. However, an increased level of brain iron may promote neurotoxicity due to free radical formation, lipid peroxidation, and ultimately, cellular death.
