Tumour lesions are converted into vaccines against autologous tumour-associated antigens by intra-tumoral injection of α-gal glycolipids, which insert into tumour cell membranes. Anti-Gal binding to α-gal epitopes on tumour cells targets them for uptake by antigen-presenting cells. Accelerated wound healing is achieved by application of α-gal nanoparticles, which bind anti-Gal, activate complement, and recruit and activate macrophages that induce tissue regeneration.
