Vegans and lactovegetarians also ate more carbohydrate and fibre than omnivores, although fat intake was similar. Mean GFR was significantly lower in the vegans than in the omnivores (100 +/- 13 vs. 113 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.04) and was intermediate in the lactovegetarians (105 +/- 16 ml/min/1.73 m2). Omnivores had significantly higher mean urinary albumin excretion rate (p less than 0.05) than vegans, and higher mean diastolic blood pressure than both vegans and lactovegetarians (p less than 0.01).
