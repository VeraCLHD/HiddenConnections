A characteristic pattern of biochemical abnormalities is observed in patients with this disorder. Galactose-1-phosphate, the substrate of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, accumulates within cells, and surplus galactose is reduced to galactitol or oxidized to galactonate. Using sophisticated mass spectrometry, these compounds as well as free galactose can be measured in plasma and in urine.
