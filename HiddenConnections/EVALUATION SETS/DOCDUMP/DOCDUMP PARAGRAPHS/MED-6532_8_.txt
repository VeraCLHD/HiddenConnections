During follow-up (average, 7.7 years), 570 incident cases of benign proliferative breast disease were ascertained in the intervention group and 793 in the comparison group. The hazard ratio for the association between DM and benign proliferative breast disease was 1.09 (95%CI, 0.98â€“1.23). Risk varied by levels of baseline total vitamin D intake but it varied little by levels of other baseline variables.
