Fiber is but one component of plant food, and to neglect the other components--be they proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, or the secondary metabolites--is to seriously limit our understanding. Much of the effort expended in defining fiber and studying the fiber isolate would have been better focused using this whole-plant-food approach. Greater progress in our understanding of the relevance of fiber in the etiology of disease would have been achieved if a more holistic approach had been followed.
