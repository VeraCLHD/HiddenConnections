ANCOVA and multiple regression analyses demonstrated that age and SBP were the most important determinants of PWV and that the effect of garlic on PWV was independent of confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic garlic powder intake attenuated age-related increases in aortic stiffness. These data strongly support the hypothesis that garlic intake had a protective effect on the elastic properties of the aorta related to aging in humans.
