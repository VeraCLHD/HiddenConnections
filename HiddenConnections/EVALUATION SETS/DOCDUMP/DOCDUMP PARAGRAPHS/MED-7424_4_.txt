We analyzed 2001-2006 NHANES data from urine iodine spot tests for pregnant (n = 326), lactating (n = 53), and nonpregnant, nonlactating (n = 1437) women of reproductive age (15-44 y). We used WHO criteria to define iodine sufficiency (median UIC: 150-249 microg/L among pregnant women; >or=100 microg/L among lactating women; and 100-199 microg/L among nonpregnant, nonlactating women). The iodine status of pregnant women was borderline sufficient (median UIC = 153 microg/L; 95% CI = 105-196), while lactating (115 microg/L; 95% CI = 62-162) and nonpregnant, nonlactating (130 microg/L; 95% CI = 117-140) women were iodine sufficient.
