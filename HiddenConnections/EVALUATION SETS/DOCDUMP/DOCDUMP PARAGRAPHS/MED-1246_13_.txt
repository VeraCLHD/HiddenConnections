Submicroscopic changes, subcellular alterations, subtle disturbances in the unfolding of brain architectonics -- none of these are excluded with methods used in this report. Further studies of threshold effects of MeHg on fetal brain are essential. That approximately half of the mercury resides in glial elements in white matter reinforces the need to focus attention upon glia as well as neurons during development.
