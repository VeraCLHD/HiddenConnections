Turnover studies indicated that the FCRs for radiolabelled VLDL and LDL were reduced in casein-fed animals compared to those fed soy protein. The elevated LDL levels in casein-fed rabbits were primarily due to a reduction in receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL-apo B. Receptor-independent removal in the two groups was similar. These studies show that the hypercholesterolemia in casein-fed rabbits, compared to those fed soy protein, is associated with cholesterol enrichment of LDL and impaired receptor-dependent removal of LDL-apo B.
