Microsatellite instability and/or LOH at tumor suppressor gene â€“ associated chromosomal loci have been associated with a higher risk for oral IEN progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Previously, our laboratories have shown that FBRs are well tolerated and possess potent antioxidant, apoptotic, and differentiation-inducing properties. Experimental Design Each participant with IEN served as their own internal control.
