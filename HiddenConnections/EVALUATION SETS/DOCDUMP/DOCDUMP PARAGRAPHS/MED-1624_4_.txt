Atmospheres by irradiation had little consistent effect, but N(2) versus air was associated with elevated dihydroascorbic acid levels. Four phytonutrients (vitamins B(9), E, and K and neoxanthin) exhibited little or no change in concentration with increasing doses of irradiation. However, total ascorbic acid (vitamin C), free ascorbic acid, lutein/zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and beta-carotene all were significantly reduced at 2.0 kGy and, depending on cultivar, were affected at lesser doses of 0.5 and 1.5 kGy.
