Results of the patients' questionnaire were consistent with those of the KI, with the most pronounced effects being observed for the 100-microg treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of a hop extract, standardized on 8-PN as a potent phytoestrogen, exerted favorable effects on vasomotor symptoms and other menopausal discomforts. Hop-derived prenylated flavonoids may provide an attractive addition to the alternative treatments available for relief of hot flushes and other menopausal discomforts.
