Abstract Human apolipoprotein E exhibits genetic polymorphism in all populations examined to date. By isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting, three common alleles have been demonstrated in 365 unrelated Nigerian blacks. Furthermore, the APO E genetic polymorphism's effect on quantitative levels of lipids and lipoproteins has been determined.
