METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 120 women were randomly allocated into two groups, receiving the Hop or placebo tablets for 12 weeks. Early menopausal symptoms were assessed using Greene scale and hot flashes were recorded in a diary before, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after intervention. RESULTS: The mean Greene score was significantly lower in the Hop group than the placebo group at the end of weeks 4 (adjusted difference: -10.0, 95% confidence interval: -11.1--8.9), 8 (-18.6, -20.1--17.1) and 12 (-23.4, -25.1--21.6).
