Various disease-specific instruments are now available and are widely used in clinical trials to measure changes in QoL in patients with IBS after treatment intervention. Although few such data are presently available from clinical trials, it seems that patients who have a therapeutic response to therapy for IBS have a corresponding improvement in HRQoL. There seems to be no major differences in HRQoL based on IBS subtype (constipation-dominant or diarrhea-dominant).
