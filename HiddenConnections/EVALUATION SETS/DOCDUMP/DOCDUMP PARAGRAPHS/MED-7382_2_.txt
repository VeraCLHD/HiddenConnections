In the present study, we conducted a crossover double-blind, placebo-control study. Twenty-three young Japanese women consumed one capsule containing triacylglycerol enriched with 80 mg ARA, equivalent to the amount in one egg, daily for 3 weeks. Blood samples were drawn before and after treatment periods, and the compositions of the LCPUFA in blood lipid fractions were measured.
