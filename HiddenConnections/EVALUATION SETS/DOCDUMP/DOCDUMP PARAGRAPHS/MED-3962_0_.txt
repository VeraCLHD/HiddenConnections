Abstract There has been a recent increase in community-associated infections linked to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. It is established that both pathogens can be recovered from retail pork, although it is unclear to what degree contamination is acquired at the farm in comparison to that acquired during processing. To address this gap, the following study reports on the carriage of MRSA and C. difficile on pigs from birth through to the end of processing.
