Smoking might increase the risk of BO, while aspirin/NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori infection, and specific "healthy" dietary factors may lower the risk. The potential value of using chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors, aspirin/NSAIDs, or statins is still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: There is today a substantial knowledge of risk factors of BO.
