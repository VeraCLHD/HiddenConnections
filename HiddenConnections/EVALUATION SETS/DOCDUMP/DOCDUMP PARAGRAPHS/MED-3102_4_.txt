Participants were randomised by facility to receive either increased sunlight exposure (additional 30-40 min/day in the early morning) with (UV+) or without (UV) calcium supplementation (600 mg/day) or neither (control) for a year. The co-primary endpoints were change in serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) and falls incidence after 12 months. RESULTS: Adherence to sunlight exposure was low (median adherence, 26%; IQR, 7%-45%).
