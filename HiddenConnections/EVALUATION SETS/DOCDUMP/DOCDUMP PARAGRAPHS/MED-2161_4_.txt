In vivo, in healthy volunteers creamed with a skin cream containing isotopically labeled (15)N-nitrite, whole body UVA irradiation (20 J/cm(2)) induced significant levels of (15)N-labeled S-nitrosothiols in the blood plasma of light exposed subjects, as detected by cavity leak out spectroscopy. Furthermore, whole body UVA irradiation caused a rapid, significant decrease, lasting up to 60 minutes, in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of healthy volunteers by 11+/-2% at 30 minutes after UVA exposure. The decrease in blood pressure strongly correlated (R(2)=0.74) with enhanced plasma concentration of nitrosated species, as detected by a chemiluminescence assay, with increased forearm blood flow (+26+/-7%), with increased flow mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery (+68+/-22%), and with decreased forearm vascular resistance (-28+/-7%).
