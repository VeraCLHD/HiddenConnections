Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials showed no survival advantage when the same doses of ascorbate were given orally, leading the medical and scientific communities to dismiss the use of ascorbate as a potential cancer treatment. However, the route of administration results in major differences in ascorbate bioavailability. Tissue and plasma concentrations are tightly controlled in response to oral administration, but this can be bypassed by intravenous administration.
