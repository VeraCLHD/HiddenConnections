Abstract Dietary habits have been rarely associated with seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. We report a case of a man with a partial symptomatic epilepsy whose daily habit of heavy coffee drinking was associated with an increased seizure frequency. This patient witnessed a dramatic decrease in the frequency of his seizures after stopping coffee ingestion.
