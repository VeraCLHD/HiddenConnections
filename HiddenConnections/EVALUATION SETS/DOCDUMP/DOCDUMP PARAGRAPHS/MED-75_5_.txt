Medical history, anthropometric indices, body composition analysis, physical activity data, biochemical and inflammatory markers were available for all the participants. Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography was performed in 58 and liver biopsy in 34 patients. RESULTS: In patients, consumption of whole grains was associated with lower abdominal fat level (β = -0.24, p = 0.02) and lower levels of insulin resistance index (β = -0.28, p = 0.009), while it also correlated inversely with interleukin-6 levels (ρ = -0.23, p = 0.05).
