Findings were robust to examination of metabolite concentrations per unit body mass index and weight, and inclusion of fasting time. CONCLUSIONS: Diet contributes to urinary phthalate concentrations in children and adolescents. Further study is needed to examine the implications of di-2-ethylhexylphthalate exposure, especially earlier in life, when more permanent metabolic changes may occur.
