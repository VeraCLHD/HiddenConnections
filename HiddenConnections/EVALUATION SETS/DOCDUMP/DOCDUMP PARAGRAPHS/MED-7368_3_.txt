We used Web of Science®’s Cited Reference Search to evaluate the impact of each primary estimate on the medical literature by determining the number of times each “primary source” has been cited. The estimated U.S. annual incidence of SCD varied widely from 180,000 to > 450,000 among 6 included studies. These different estimates were in part due to different data sources (with data age ranging from 1980 to 2007), definitions of SCD, case ascertainment criteria, methods of estimation/extrapolation, and sources of case ascertainment.
