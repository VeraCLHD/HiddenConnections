Of 26 cases that lacked abnormal tau in the transentorhinal region, 4 did not show pretangle material at subcortical sites. The remaining 22 of these same 26 cases, however, had subcortical lesions confined to non-thalamic nuclei with diffuse projections to the cerebral cortex, and, remarkably, in 19/22 individuals the pretangle material was confined to the noradrenergic coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex. Assuming the pretangle alterations are not transient and do not regress, these findings may indicate that the Alzheimer's disease-related pathological process leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation does not begin in the cerebral cortex but, rather, in select subcortical nuclei, and it may start quite early, i.e., before puberty or in early young adulthood.
