Abstract This retrospective study was aimed at evaluating the effects of cigarette consumption on semen parameters in a group of men with idiopathic infertility. The semen quality of 2 groups of men with idiopathic infertility, smokers (n = 118) and nonsmokers (n = 153), were compared. Conventional semen analysis was performed and sperm morphology was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
