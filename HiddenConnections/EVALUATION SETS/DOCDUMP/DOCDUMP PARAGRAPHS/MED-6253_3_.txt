We examined the effect of a single pulse of melatonin on cerebral and peripheral blood flow, using the latter as a positive control. Ten male healthy volunteers (mean age, 22 +/- 3.2 yr) participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. On one occasion 10 microg melatonin were infused i.v., and on the other occasion saline was infused as the matching placebo.
