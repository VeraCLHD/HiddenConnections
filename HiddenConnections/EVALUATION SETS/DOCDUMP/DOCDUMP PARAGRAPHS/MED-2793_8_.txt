Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy found changes in additional metabolites, including betaine and isoleucine, that might play key roles in inhibiting and stimulating appetite suppression pathways. Our study results indicate that a broader array of metabolites might be involved in triggering gut hormone release in humans than previously thought. IMPORTANCE One theory for rising levels of obesity in western populations is that the bodyâ€™s mechanisms for controlling appetite evolved to match ancestral diets with more low-energy plant foods.
