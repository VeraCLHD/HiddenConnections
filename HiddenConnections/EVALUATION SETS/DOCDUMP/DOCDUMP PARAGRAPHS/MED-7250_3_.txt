They had identical UV absorption spectra (lambda max = 535 nm) by diode array analysis, and mass spectrometry indicated that one (betacyanin 1) was betanin or its epimer and the other (betacyanin 2) a disaccharide of betacyanin 1. In a population of 100 normal subjects the 0-8 h urinary recoveries after an oral dose of 60 mg beetroot extract were 0.06-0.54% for betacyanin 1 and 0.01-0.6% for betacyanin 2. The distributions of these data were skewed but not clearly bimodal by visual inspection or by kernel density analysis.
