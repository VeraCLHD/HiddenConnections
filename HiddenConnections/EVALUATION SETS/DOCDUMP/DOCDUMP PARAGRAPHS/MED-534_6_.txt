RESULTS: The crude protein, ether extract and crude fiber content of GC were 22.4, 25.7 and 10.5 %, respectively. Daily dry matter intake and average daily gain during the entire experimental period were affected (p < 0.01) by the treatment diet. Dry matter intake increased with increasing GC level in the ration.
