A significant (P<0.05; P<0.01) increase of the major part of cytokines and growth factors was found. A few chemokines were stimulated. Immune-mediators with pro-inflammatory activity (IL-17, EOTAXIN and IFNγ) were significantly (P<0.01) stimulated by all strains, followed by IL-1b>IP-10>IL-6>MIP1α.
