The dramatic enhancement of VACO 5 cell death by TPA, and the high level resistance of HCT 116 cells to butyrate were not evident from histone acetylation determinations. Thus, applications of butyrate for cytoreduction therapy will benefit from pharmacodynamic assessment of histone acetylation, but will require additional work to predict susceptibility to butyrate-induced death.
