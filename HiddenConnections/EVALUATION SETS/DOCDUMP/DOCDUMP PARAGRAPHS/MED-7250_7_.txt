Studies using in situ isolated perfused rat jejunum and liver preparations indicated a negligible absorption of the pigments after 1 h and no detectable metabolism or biliary secretion. Intact anaesthetized rats given i.v. bolus doses of beetroot extract cleared both betacyanins from plasma at the rate of 3.3 +/- 0.9 (SD) ml min-1 (n = 5). The total urinary recovery of both pigments amounted to 80% of the dose, and their renal clearances approached their plasma clearances.
