The results of the experimental study showed no marked significant differences of Al concentration between market milk (control group) and those boiled in Al cookware, as well as to those boiled in stainless-steel cookware. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: â€‚ The results of the present study indicate that Al level in milk kept in Al containers and dairy products packed in Al foil is beyond the permissible limits, suggesting health hazard. Therefore, all milk cans should be constructed of stainless steel, prevent the entrance of tap water into milk, and the processed cheese should be packed in glass containers and not wrapped in Al foil.
