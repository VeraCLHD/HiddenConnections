The ability of VcPP to inhibit glucan synthesis by three distinct recombinant glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) was assessed by quantifying the production of water-soluble and -insoluble polysaccharides in bacterial cultures. In addition, the buffering effect of VcPP in cultures of S. mutans was evaluated. RESULTS: VcPP reduced adhesion of S. mutans to sHA and biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner.
