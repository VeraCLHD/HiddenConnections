Therefore, the ESBL NDP (Nordmann/Dortet/Poirel) test was developed for a rapid identification of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae. This biochemical test was based on the in vitro detection of a cephalosporin (cefotaxime) hydrolysis that is inhibited by tazobactam addition. The ESBL activity was evidenced by a color change (red to yellow) of a pH indicator (red phenol) due to carboxyl-acid formation resulting from cefotaxime hydrolysis that was reversed by addition of tazobactam (positive test).
