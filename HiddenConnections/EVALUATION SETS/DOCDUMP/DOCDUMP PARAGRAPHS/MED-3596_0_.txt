Abstract There is strong evidence indicating that elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels are a major independent biomarker and/or a contributor to chronic conditions, such as CVD. A deficiency of vitamin B₁₂ can elevate homocysteine. Vegetarians are a group of the population who are potentially at greater risk of vitamin B₁₂ deficiency than omnivores.
