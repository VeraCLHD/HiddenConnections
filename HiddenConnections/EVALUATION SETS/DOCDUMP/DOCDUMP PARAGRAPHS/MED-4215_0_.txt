Abstract An increased intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content, as quantified by (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. At present, it is unclear which factors determine IMCL formation and how rapidly IMCL accumulation can be induced. We therefore studied the impact of hyperinsulinemia and elevated circulating nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels on IMCL formation and insulin sensitivity.
