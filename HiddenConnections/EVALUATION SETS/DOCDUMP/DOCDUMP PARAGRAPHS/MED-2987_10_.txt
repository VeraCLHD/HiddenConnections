Conversely, those in the lowest tertile decreased the weight of food consumed (100 g/d), with little change in EI. The highest and middle tertiles had favorable changes in fruit, vegetable, vitamin, and mineral intakes. CONCLUSION: Both large and modest ED reductions were associated with weight loss and improved diet quality.
