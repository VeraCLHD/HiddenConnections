The first pathway, chromosomal instability, is characterized by allelic losses and aneuploidy. The second pathway, microsatellite instability, is characterized by an abundance of subtle DNA mutations and diploidy. Although the genes causing chromosomal instability remain unknown, microsatellite instability is caused by inactivation of a DNA mismatch repair gene (predominantly MLH1 or MSH2).
