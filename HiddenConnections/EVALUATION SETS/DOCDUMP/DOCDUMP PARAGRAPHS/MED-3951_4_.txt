Coronary arteries of patients who died of acute coronary syndrome (n = 19) and non-acute coronary syndrome causes (n = 12) and carotid plaques from patients with (n = 51) and without (n = 19) neurologic symptoms were studied. Samples were examined for CCs perforating the intima using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with ethanol or vacuum dehydration. In addition, fresh unfixed carotid plaques were examined at 37 degrees C using confocal microscopy.
