The rate of clinical diagnosis among those with chronic kidney disease was 26.5% (95% confidence interval, 17.9 to 35.1), suggesting that 74% of patients with chronic kidney disease are undiagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is substantially higher in health-seeking individuals than in the general population. Moreover, we demonstrate that laboratory reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation alone does not result in an optimal rate of clinical diagnosis.
