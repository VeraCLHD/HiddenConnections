In conclusion, consumption of RS dramatically affects the colonic lumenal environment and facilitates apoptotic deletion of genetically damaged cells in the colon, several of which are considered to be biomarkers associated with risk for CRC. These effects can be interpreted as reflecting improved colonic health, which might be of benefit in protection against CRC. Direct evidence for protection is still not available.
