Self-reported age was validated with several common methods and found to correlate well with documented age. Demographic methods, including assessment of age heaping, maximum age at death, centenarian proportions, and male to female ratios of centenarians indicate that the age registration system is reliable. We conclude that the high reported centenarian prevalence in Okinawa is valid and warrants further study for its genetic and environmental correlates.
