Abstract BACKGROUND: Flax is a food and dietary supplement commonly used for menopausal symptoms. Flax is known for its lignan, Î±-linolenic acid, and fiber content, components that may possess phytogestrogenic, anti-inflammatory, and hormone modulating effects, respectively. We conducted a systematic review of flax for efficacy in improving menopausal symptoms in women living with breast cancer and for potential impact on risk of breast cancer incidence or recurrence.
