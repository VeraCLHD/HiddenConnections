The observed relative proportions of LOS subtypes and genetic polymorphisms in the cstII gene (encoding bacterial sialyltransferases involved in LOS synthesis in C. jejuni) were characterized and compared to those reported in published studies of patients with GBS, MFS and uncomplicated enteritis. Commercial poultry products carry a relatively high prevalence of C. jejuni strains that have been associated with neuropathic sequelae. The relative proportions of LOS classes in poultry isolates were similar to those reported in isolates from human enteritis cases, and in some instances also similar to isolates from patients diagnosed with neuropathic disease.
