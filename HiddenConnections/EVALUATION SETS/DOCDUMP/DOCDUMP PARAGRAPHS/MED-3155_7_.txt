The anti-inflammatory activities of synbiotics (probiotics plus fiber) were reviewed as well, but there was no convincing evidence indicating higher efficacy of synbiotics compared with that of fiber alone. Adverse effects have not been observed with the amount of fiber intake or supplementation used in studies, although patients with Crohn’s disease may be more sensitive to inulin intake. Several possible mechanisms that may mediate the body weight–unrelated anti-inflammatory activity of fibers are discussed based on the in vitro and in vivo evidence.
