However, the multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that caffeine was no longer a significant factor associated with ET (p=0.119). There was no significant correlation between amount of caffeine intake and disease duration (Spearman's r=0.194; p=0.202) or total tremor score (Spearman's r=0.045; p=0.771) in ET patients. CONCLUSION: Caffeine consumption was not associated with risk of ET in our study population.
