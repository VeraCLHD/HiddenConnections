Second, measurements of urine volume 60 min after consuming a water bolus (11.0 or 14 mLÂ·kg(-1)) were strongly and inversely correlated with entering hydration state, assessed by urine specific gravity (r(2) = 0.76, p < 0.0001) and urine osmolality (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.0001). We concluded that healthy men can employ simple measurements of morning thirst sensation and urine volume to identify the presence of mild hypohydration and to guide fluid replacement. These 2 techniques are relevant because HY (-2% body mass) is the approximate threshold for the onset of thirst, reduced endurance exercise performance, and decrements of working memory and mood.
