Abstract The human gut is a lush microbial ecosystem containing about 100 trillion microorganisms, whose collective genome, the microbiome, contains 100-fold more genes than the entire human genome. The symbiosis of our extended genome plays a role in host homeostasis and energy extraction from diet. In this article, we summarize some of the studies that have advanced the understanding of the microbiome and its effects on metabolism, obesity, and health.
