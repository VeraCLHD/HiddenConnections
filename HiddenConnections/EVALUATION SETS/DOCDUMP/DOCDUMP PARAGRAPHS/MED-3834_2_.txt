We used the ambulatory 24-h pH monitor to assess esophageal acid exposure in 10 normal subjects and 10 GER patients following low and high fat meals eaten in two body positions. The meals had nearly identical protein content, volumes, and calories. On successive days, patients ingested one of the meals twice, followed by random assignment to 3 h upright and 3 h recumbent position.
