In this randomized, cross-over study overweight or obese men and postmenopausal women (n = 25) with pre-diabetes consumed 0, 13, or 26 g ground flaxseed for 12 weeks. Glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), and normalized percent of α-linolenic fatty acid (ALA) were significantly different by treatment (multiple analysis of variance, P = .036, P = .013, P = .008, P = .024 respectively). Paired t tests showed glucose decreased on the 13 g intervention compared to the 0 g period [13 g = -2.10 ± 1.66 mg/L (mean ± SEM), 0 g = 9.22 ± 4.44 mg/L, P = .036].
