We assessed the relationship between BV and selected dietary indicators among a cohort of 1735 nonpregnant women ages 15â€“44 y from Birmingham, Alabama. Annual intake was assessed with the Block98 FFQ, and the glycemic index, glycemic load (GL), and Healthy Eating Index were calculated by the Block Dietary Data System. The Naturally Nutrient Rich (NNR) score was also calculated.
