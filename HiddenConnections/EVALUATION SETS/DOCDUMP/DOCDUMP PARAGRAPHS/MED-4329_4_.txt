However, the data from such trials on care for women with a multiple pregnancy are limited. Many areas of care require better-quality information, including when using assisted reproductive techniques, the optimal number of embryos to be transferred, care after the diagnosis of chorionicity, and the benefits of specialised multiple pregnancy clinics. Better-quality information is required to inform clinical practice for women with complications of multiple pregnancy, including monoamniotic twin pregnancy, treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, and care following single intrauterine fetal death.
