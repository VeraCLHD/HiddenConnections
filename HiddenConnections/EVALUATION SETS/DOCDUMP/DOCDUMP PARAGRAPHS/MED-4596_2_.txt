The breakdown of tea-derived polyphenols to low molecular weight phenols in vivo was measured using high-resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of ileostomy effluent, but there was no evidence of low molecular weight breakdown products from the polyphenols of ingested tea in this effluent. These results suggest that only a small proportion of Al in tea is potentially available for absorption throughout the small bowel. It may be misleading to estimate systemic Al absorption from tea drinking simply from total urinary aluminium excretion as has been done previously.
