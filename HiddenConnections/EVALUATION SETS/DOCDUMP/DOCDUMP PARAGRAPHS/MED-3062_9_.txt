However, the strongest risk of CVD mortality was observed among smokers with lowest levels of β-carotene (HR=3.15, 95%, CI: 1.19-8.33; P=0.020). Other carotenoids and the sum of carotenoids were not significantly related to increased risk of CVD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Low concentrations of serum β-carotene concentrations may increase the risk for CVD mortality among Eastern Finnish men; thus elevated serum concentrations of β-carotene may have clinical and public health relevance.
