Substantial amounts of filtered lipoprotein cause proliferation of mesangial cells. Proximal tubules reabsorb some of the filtered lipoprotein, and the remainder is altered during passage through the nephron. If intraluminal pH is close to the isoelectric point of the apoprotein, luminal apoprotein will precipitate, causing tubulointerstitial disease.
