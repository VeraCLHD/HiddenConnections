A key obstacle to studying many Ca2+-sensing proteins is the difficulty in identifying the numerous downstream target interactions that respond to Ca2+-induced conformational changes. Among a number of Ca2+ sensors in the eukaryotic cell, calmodulin (CaM) is the most widespread and the best studied. Employing the mRNA display technique, we have scanned the human proteome for CaM-binding proteins and have identified and characterized a large number of both known and previously uncharacterized proteins that interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner.
