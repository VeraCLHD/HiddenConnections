Twelve of the subjects met all inclusion criteria and were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design for 2 x 4 weeks (washout > or =4 weeks). Subjects ingested capsules containing 3 x 0.5 g of highly purified BDG or 3 x 0.5 g of placebo (waxy maize starch) daily. Maintenance of the normal diet of the participants and the correct intake of the capsules were monitored, using 6 x 3-day food recording and counting of the provided capsules.
