Additionally, 3 swine hearts were casted and imaged post-mortem using cone-beam CT to obtain the lumen volume and the arterial length of corresponding coronary arteries. Using densitometry, the results showed that the stem hyperemic flow (Q) and the associated crown lumen volume (V) were related by Q = 159.08 V3/4 (r = 0.98, SEE = 10.59 ml/min). The stem hyperemic flow and the associated crown length (L) using cone-beam CT were related by Q = 2.89 L (r = 0.99, SEE = 8.72 ml/min).
