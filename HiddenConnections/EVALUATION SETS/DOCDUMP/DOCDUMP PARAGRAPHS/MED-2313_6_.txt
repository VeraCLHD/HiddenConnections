Within the experimental group, those fed acai demonstrated the lowest serum TC and CETP activity, while the LL-consuming group showed a reduction in serum TC and TG relative to HCD-fed fish. Serum glucose levels also increased in the HCD group, to threefold above the ND group; GS and LL feeding elicited the greatest reduction in hyperglycemia. The groups consuming acai and LL showed much less hepatic inflammation, as well as attenuation of fatty liver and a reduced content of oxidized species.
