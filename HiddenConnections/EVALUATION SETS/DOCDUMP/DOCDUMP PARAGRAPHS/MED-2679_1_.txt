Cariogenic potential indices were calculated for each food from sulcal and buccal-lingual caries based on both number and severity. Those foods with the lowest cariogenic potential indices were peanuts, gelatin dessert, corn chips, yoghurt, and bologna; with the highest cariogenic potential indices were sucrose, granola cereal, french fries, bananas, cupcakes, and raisins. There was no simple relationship between food sucrose content and caries.
