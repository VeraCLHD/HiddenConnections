ESC resistance among Salmonella in the United States is usually mediated by a plasmid-encoded blaCMY Î²-lactamase. In 2009, we identified 47 ESC resistant blaCMY-positive Heidelberg isolates from humans (n=18), food animals at slaughter (n=16), and retail meats (n=13) associated with a spike in the prevalence of this serovar. Almost 90% (26/29) of the animal and meat isolates were isolated from chicken carcasses or retail chicken meat.
