Blood samples were taken from fasting men before and after 2, 4, and 6 wk of treatment and 24-h urine samples were collected before the first intervention period and after treatment. Plasma total PSA concentrations were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP, with a mean treatment effect of -14% (P = 0.04). Additionally, fasting plasma insulin and 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively).
