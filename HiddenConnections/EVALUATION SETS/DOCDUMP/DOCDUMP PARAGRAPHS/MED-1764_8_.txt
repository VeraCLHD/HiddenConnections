Higher 25(OH)D concentrations at diagnosis were significantly associated with longer survival (adjusted HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99 per 10 nmol/L), but there was no significant association with progression-free survival or for 25(OH)D measured after primary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations at diagnosis were associated with longer survival among women with ovarian cancer. If confirmed in other studies, this suggests that vitamin D status at diagnosis may be an independent predictor of prognosis.
