Results: Sodium intake increased RCC risk (P-trend=0.03), whereas fluid and potassium intake did not. For high sodium and low fluid intake, the RCC risk additionally increased (P-interaction=0.02). Conclusion: Sodium intake is a potential risk factor for RCC, particularly if fluid consumption is low.
