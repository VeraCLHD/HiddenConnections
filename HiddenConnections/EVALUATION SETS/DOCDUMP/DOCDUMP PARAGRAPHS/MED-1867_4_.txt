Colonoscopic mucosal biopsies were taken to measure proliferation rates. In comparison with NAs, AAs consumed more (P < 0.01) protein (94 +/- 9.3 vs. 58 +/- 4.1 g/d) and fat (114 +/- 11.2 vs. 38 +/- 3.0 g/d), meat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. However, they also consumed more (P < 0.05) calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, and fiber intake was the same.
