These results may suggest a possible role of harman and norharman or its N-methylated carbolinium ions in the pathophysiological processes initiating PD. However the origin of increased levels of these beta-carbolines remains unclear. On the one hand one may speculate, that unknown metabolic processes induce the increased synthesis of harman and norharman in PD.
