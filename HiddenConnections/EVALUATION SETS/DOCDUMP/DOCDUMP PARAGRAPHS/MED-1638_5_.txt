RESULTS: All analyzed serum parameters were within normal ranges and similar; between the two groups of subjects and among the three periods. Vis-Ã -vis the urinary parameters, most of the baseline values for both groups were similar. After taking the tea, the trend was an increase in oxalate and citrate in both groups and uric acid excretion and clearance in the NS group.
