METHODS: The population-based prospective Cohort of Swedish Men included 38 859 men, aged 45 to 79 years, who had no history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer at baseline. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: During an 11.7 years follow-up, 3097 incident cases of stroke, including 2482 cerebral infarctions and 450 intracerebral hemorrhages, were registered.
