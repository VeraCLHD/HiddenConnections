A twice-daily use of alcohol-containing mouthwashes leads to a systemic acetaldehyde exposure of 0.26 microg/kg bodyweight/day on average, which corresponds to a lifetime cancer risk of 3E-6. The margin of exposure was calculated to be 217,604, which would be seen as a low public health concern. However, the local acetaldehyde contents in the saliva are reaching concentrations associated with DNA adduct formation and sister chromatid exchange in vitro, so that concerns for local carcinogenic effects in the oral cavity remain.
