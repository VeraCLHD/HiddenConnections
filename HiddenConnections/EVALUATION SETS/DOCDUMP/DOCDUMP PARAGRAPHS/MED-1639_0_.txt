Abstract Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAA) are carcinogenic compounds found in the crust of fried meat. The objective was to examine the possibility of inhibiting HAA formation in fried beef patties by using marinades with different concentrations of hibiscus extract (Hibiscus sabdariffa) (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 g/100g). After frying, patties were analyzed for 15 different HAA by HPLC-analysis.
