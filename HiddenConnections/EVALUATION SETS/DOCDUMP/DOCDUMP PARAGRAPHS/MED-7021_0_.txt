Abstract OBJECTIVE: Concord grape juice (CGJ) is a rich source of phenolic antioxidants, with a range of putative health benefits. However, high beverage energy and fructose intake may lead to weight gain and insulin resistance, respectively. This study assessed the effects of CGJ consumption for 12 weeks on appetite, diet, body weight, lipid profile, and antioxidant status.
