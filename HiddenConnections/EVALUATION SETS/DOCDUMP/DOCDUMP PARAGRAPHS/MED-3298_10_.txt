Unexplained fetal right heart decompensation requires detailed echocardiographic evaluation of the ductus arteriosus and a sophisticated medical history with regard to analgesics. In contrast to ibuprofen and high-dose aspirin, metamizole and low-dose aspirin have not yet been reported as possible agents constricting the fetal arterial duct. In any suspected context, early delivery as in our cases may save babies life.
