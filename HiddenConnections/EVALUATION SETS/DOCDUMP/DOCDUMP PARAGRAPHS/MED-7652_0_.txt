Abstract We had previously found that male mice could be trained to discriminate between the urine odor of aged and young adult (adult) mice. We hypothesized that these odors that characterized the older animals might be inhibited by a mixture of extracts (AAM) of mugwort and mushroom, because previous studies have indicated that these extracts could be used to reduce the intensity of unpleasant body odors. The findings of this chemical study strongly suggest that the AAM function helped to modify the aged mouse urine odor so that it more closely resembled the smell of urine from younger mice.
