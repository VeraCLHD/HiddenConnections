This finding, in living, non-demented humans, is consistent with prior autopsy reports, with epidemiological findings, and with both animal and in vitro work suggesting an important role for cholesterol in Aβ processing. Because cholesterol levels are modifiable, understanding their link to amyloid deposition could potentially and eventually have impact in retarding the pathological cascade of AD. These findings suggest that understanding the mechanisms through which serum lipids modulate Aβ could offer new approaches to slowing Aβ deposition and thus to reducing the incidence of AD.
