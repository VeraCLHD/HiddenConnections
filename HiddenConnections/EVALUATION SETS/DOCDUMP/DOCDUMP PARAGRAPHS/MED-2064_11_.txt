Furthermore, the dose-dependent excretion of 8-PN was tested after the consumption of a higher volume of a single beer brand with and without spiking with 8-PN and a small oral dose of authentic 8-PN, respectively. Conflicting results led to a pilot test on the in vivo conversion (demethylation) of IX into 8-PN in two men. Conversion rates of 1.9 and 4.4% were estimated.
