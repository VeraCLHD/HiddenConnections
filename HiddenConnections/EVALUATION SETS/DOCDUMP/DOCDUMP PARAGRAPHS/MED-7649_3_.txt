Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic study revealed that myosin heavy chain (MHC) underwent polymerization to a higher extent in the presence of MTGase. Regardless of setting condition, microstructure of gel added with MTGase was finer with a smaller void compared with that of gel without MTGase. Therefore, setting temperature affected the property of gels added with MTGase.
