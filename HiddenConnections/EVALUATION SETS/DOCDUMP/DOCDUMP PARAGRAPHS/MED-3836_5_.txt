Moreover, alcohol >200 kcal/day (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.03-15.55) and intake of a large quantity of food at supper (OR 7.85, 95% CI 1.66-37.05) were significant risk factors for EE in subjects with hiatal hernia. Intake of a large quantity of food at supper (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.06-4.13) was more common in the NERD group than in the EE group. CONCLUSIONS: There were differences in the associated lifestyle factors between patients with NERD and those with EE, and there was also a gender-related difference between these groups.
