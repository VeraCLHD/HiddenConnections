Intact anaesthetized rats given i.v. bolus doses of beetroot extract cleared both betacyanins from plasma at the rate of 3.3 +/- 0.9 (SD) ml min-1 (n = 5). The total urinary recovery of both pigments amounted to 80% of the dose, and their renal clearances approached their plasma clearances. These data suggest that beeturia does not arise from deficiencies in hepatic metabolism or renal excretion of betacyanins.
