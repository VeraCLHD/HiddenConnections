Many of these metabolites of arachidonic acid feature prominently in the development of inflammation. Prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin are potent vasodilators, while leukotriene D4 causes cellular adhesion, chemotaxis of neutrophils and degranulation. Leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4 contribute to inflammation by increasing vascular permeability.
