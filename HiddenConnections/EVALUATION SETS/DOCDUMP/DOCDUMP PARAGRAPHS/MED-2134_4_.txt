The summary ES suggested a significantly positive association between PD and overall pesticide use (non-occupational and/or occupational pesticide use) [1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 1.52, the fixed-effects model], as well as between PD and occupational pesticide exposure (1.49 with a 95% CI of 1.34-1.66). Both occupational herbicide and occupational insecticide exposure showed a significant association with PD. The results of the meta-analysis reported in this study suggest the existence of a statistically positive association between PD and pesticide exposure.
