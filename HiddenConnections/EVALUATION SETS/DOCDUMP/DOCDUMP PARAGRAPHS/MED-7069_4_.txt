An average of 60-80% of the phosphorus intake is absorbed in the gut in dialysis patients. If phosphate binders are employed, the phosphorus absorbed from the diet may be reduced to 40%. Conventional hemodialysis with a high-flux, high-efficiency dialyzer removes approximately 30 mmol (900 mg) phosphorus during each dialysis performed three times weekly.
