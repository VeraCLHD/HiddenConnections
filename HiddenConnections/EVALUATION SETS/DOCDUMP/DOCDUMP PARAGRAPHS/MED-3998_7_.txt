Plasma low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were determined. There were not any statistically significant differences in mean serum total cholesterol or mean plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when subjects consumed the diets. Mean plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated at the end of the 21-day period when the animal protein diet was consumed (48 +/- 3 mg/dl) compared to the period when the plant protein diet was fed (42 +/- 2 mg/dl).
