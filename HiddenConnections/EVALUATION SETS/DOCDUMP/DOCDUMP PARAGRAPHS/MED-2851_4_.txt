Surprisingly, these trials did not demonstrate neither mortality nor a CVD advantage with intensive glycemic control. Moreover, some studies (e.g., the ACCORD [Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes] study) showed increased mortality in the intensive control arm. In this review, our goal is to summarize the findings of the major trials in this field and to explore the potential reasons for why these trials had largely negative results.
