With fermentable energy available, microbes synthesize protein by using ammonia released by their enzymes from urea and other nitrogenous substances in ingesta and intestinal secretions. Fibber fermentation also yields fatty acids that lower the concentration of free ammonia by lowering pH. Fiber increases bulk and water of intestinal contents, shortens transit time, and decreases the concentration of toxic substances in contact with the intestinal mucosa. These processes decrease duration and intensity of exposure of the intestinal mucosa to free ammonia, the form of nitrogen that is most toxic and most readily absorbed by cells.
