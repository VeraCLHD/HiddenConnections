Mechanistically, resistance phenomena may be explained by (i) overexpression of drug efflux pumps, (ii) enhanced drug detoxification, (iii) rapid DNA repair efficiency, (iv) defects in apoptosis regulation, and (v) active cell survival signals. Several adverse effects associated with multidrug resistance and the need for safe multi-targeted anticancer drugs instigated the use of the phytochemical, curcumin, the yellow pigment of the spice turmeric, which has pleotropic activities. We performed a structured literature review using PubMed and Medline searches with secondary review of cited publications, identifying studies on the role of curcumin in conquering drug resistance in cancer.
