Stools passed on three consecutive days on the usual diet prior to commencement and on days 5, 6 and 7 during each experimental diet, were collected. Outcome measures were whole gut transit time, 24 h stool output, faecal pH, particle size, and short chain fatty acid content. Seeds recovered from stools were examined by scanning electron microscopy.
