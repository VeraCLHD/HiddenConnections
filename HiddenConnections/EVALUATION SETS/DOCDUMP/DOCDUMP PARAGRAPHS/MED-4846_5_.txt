In gingival crevicular fluid, periodontopathogens, levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 as well as the activity of granulocyte elastase were determined. In stimulated saliva, antioxidative and oxidative variables were measured. After 12 months the following significant changes could be observed: reduction of clinical probing depth (2.40 v. 2.20 mm; P < 0.001), reduction of gingival inflammation (gingival index 1.13 v. 0.9; P < 0.001), reduced concentrations of IL-1beta (4.63 v. 1.10 pg/ml per site; P < 0.001) as well as IL-6 (1.85 v. 0.34 pg/ml per site; P = 0.022) in gingival crevicular fluid.
