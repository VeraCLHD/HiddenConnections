Abstract Our understanding of the factors determining the bioavailability of carotenoids from fruits and vegetables is poor. The apolar nature of carotenoids precludes their simple diffusion from the food structure to the absorption site at the enterocyte. Therefore, there is interest in the potential pathways for solubilization in the gut before absorption.
