Using a controlled cross-over study design, 85 subjects completed a 4-week healthy diet run-in period before randomization to one of two 4-week intervention sequences in which they either consumed 2 green kiwifruit a day plus a healthy diet (intervention) or consumed a healthy diet alone (control). Blood pressure and other measures of cardiovascular function (using a Finometer MIDI [Finapres Medical Systems B.V, Amsterdam, The Netherlands] and standard oscillometric device) and anthropometric measurements were taken before and at the end of the treatment periods. A physical activity questionnaire was completed during the last visit.
