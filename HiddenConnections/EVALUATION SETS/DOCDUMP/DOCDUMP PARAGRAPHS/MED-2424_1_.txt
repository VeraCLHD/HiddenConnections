The authors' objective was to determine what particular foods consumed early in life (first 2 years) are associated with risk of childhood leukemia in a 1995-2002 case-control study of a diverse California population. Dietary data were obtained from a questionnaire administered to the child's caregiver. Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze 328 case-control sets matched on age, sex, Hispanic status, and maternal race.
