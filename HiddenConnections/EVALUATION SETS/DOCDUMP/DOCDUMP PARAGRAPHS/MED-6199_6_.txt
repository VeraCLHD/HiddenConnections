TAS was ~10% greater in the cherry juice than the placebo group for all post-supplementation measures (P<0.05).

The cherry juice appears to provide a viable means to aid recovery following strenuous exercise by increasing total antioxidative capacity, reducing inflammation, lipid peroxidation and so aiding in the recovery of muscle function.
