Although seafood is the principal source of human infections by this parasite, we have found allergic symptoms in 8 patients previously diagnosed as having A simplex sensitization after they ate chicken meat.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether parasite proteins present in chicken meat could be responsible for the symptoms reported by these subjects.
