Abstract Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition of unknown etiology and has been linked to adverse reproductive and obstetric health outcomes. Prior dietary research on BV has focused on specific macro- and micronutrients, but not dietary indices. We assessed the relationship between BV and selected dietary indicators among a cohort of 1735 nonpregnant women ages 15â€“44 y from Birmingham, Alabama.
