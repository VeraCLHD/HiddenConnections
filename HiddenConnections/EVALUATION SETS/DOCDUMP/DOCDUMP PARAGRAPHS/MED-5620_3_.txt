Although the anterior structures of the eye absorb much of the UV component of the optical radiation spectrum, a portion of the UVA band (315-400 nm) penetrates into the retina. Natural sources, such as the sun, emit energetic UV photons in relatively long durations, which typically do not result in energy confinement in the retina, and thus do not produce thermal or mechanical damage but are capable of inducing photochemical damage. Photochemical damage in the retina proceeds through Type 1 (direct reactions involving proton or electron transfers) and Type 2 (reactions involving reactive oxygen species) mechanisms.
