A subset of these participants also had brain MRI of total WMH available to conduct a formal mediation analysis of a putative relationship between O3PUFA and cognitive function. Results: Mean age at baseline was 86, 62% were female and 11% carried the APOE4 allele. Each 100 Î¼g/ml increase in plasma O3PUFA associated with 4 s less change in executive decline per year of aging (p = 0.02, fully adjusted model).
