We collected breast milk samples from 46 first-time mothers, 2-8 weeks after birth. We also sampled house dust from the homes of a subset of participants by vacuuming commonly used areas. Data on personal characteristics, diet, home furniture, and electrical devices were gathered from each participant using a questionnaire.
