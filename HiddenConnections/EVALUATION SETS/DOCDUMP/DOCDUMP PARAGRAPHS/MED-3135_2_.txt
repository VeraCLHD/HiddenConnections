METHODS: The patients were trained to use arm tensing and/or handgrip in case of occurrence of symptoms of impending syncope. RESULTS: During 14+/-6 months of follow-up, 260 episodes of impending syncope were reported by 19 patients; the manoeuvres were self-administered by these patients in 98% of cases and were able to abort syncope in 99.6% of cases. Overall, 5 episodes of syncope occurred in 5 patients (17%), in 4 cases without and in 1 with activation of the manoeuvres.
