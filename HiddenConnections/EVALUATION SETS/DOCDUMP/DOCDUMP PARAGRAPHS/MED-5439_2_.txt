Moreover, recent clinical trials have suggested that mono-therapy with certain antioxidant vitamins like vitamin E may, in fact, be detrimental [13]. As a result of the disappointing outcome of 'antioxidant' vitamin trials, some authors have questioned both the utility of 'antioxidant' treatment in CVD and the supposedly central role of oxidative stress in atherogenesis [14-19]. Other investigators, however, sustain that the beneficial effects of lipid lowering and anti-hypertensive treatment are at least, in part, due to their 'antioxidant' properties, in addition to their specific pharmacological properties [20, 21].
