Further subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in systolic blood pressure was significant in both white and black people and in men and women. Meta-analysis of data on hormones and lipids showed that the mean change was 0.26 ng/mL/h (0.17 to 0.36, I(2)=70%) for plasma renin activity, 73.20 pmol/L (44.92 to 101.48, I(2)=62%) for aldosterone, 187 pmol/L (39 to 336, I(2)=5%) for noradrenaline (norepinephrine), 37 pmol/L (-1 to 74, I(2)=12%) for adrenaline (epinephrine), 0.05 mmol/L (-0.02 to 0.11, I(2)=0%) for total cholesterol, 0.05 mmol/L (-0.01 to 0.12, I(2)=0%) for low density lipoprotein cholesterol, -0.02 mmol/L (-0.06 to 0.01, I(2)=16%) for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 0.04 mmol/L (-0.02 to 0.09, I(2)=0%) for triglycerides. CONCLUSIONS: A modest reduction in salt intake for four or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in blood pressure in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group.
