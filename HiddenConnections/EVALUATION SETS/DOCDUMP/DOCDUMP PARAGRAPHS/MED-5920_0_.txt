Abstract A method for culturing cysticerci that allows successful evagination and growth of scolexes from metacestodes of Taenia solium was used to study the survival of cysticerci subjected to low temperatures. Refrigeration of pork muscle infested with cysticerci at temperatures above 0 degrees C did not affect the parasites' survival in culture. Conversely, freezing of meat prevented survival of cysts.
