Metabolites of the HMW phthalates (DEHP, DiNP and DiDP) showed a rapid decline to levels 5-10 times lower than initial levels within 24h of the fast and remained low thereafter. After food consumption resumed, levels rose again. By contrast, metabolites of the LMW phthalates including DMP, DEP, BBzP, DnBP and DiBP showed a cyclical pattern of rising and declining concentrations suggestive of ongoing non-food exposures.
