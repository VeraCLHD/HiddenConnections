We did not find any change in resting energy expenditure, hormones known to mediate satiety, or insulin resistance when comparing the walnut versus placebo diet. Walnut consumption over 4 days increased satiety by day 3. Long term studies are needed to confirm the physiologic role of walnuts, the duration of time needed for these effects to occur, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
