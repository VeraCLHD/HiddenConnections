Abstract Objective The study evaluated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and upper respiratory infection (URI) incidence during pregnancy. Design In a cohort of 1034 North American women, each subject was asked retrospectively about their fruit and vegetable intake during the six months before the pregnancy and their occurrences of URI during the first half of pregnancy. Multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models.
