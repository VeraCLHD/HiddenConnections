Outcomes and Measurements Microalbuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio 25 to 354 mcg/mg) in 2000 and change in kidney function by eGFR between 1989 and 2000. Results After multivariable adjustment, the highest quartile of Western pattern score compared to the lowest quartile was directly associated with microalbuminuria (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.66; p-for trend=0.01) and rapid eGFR decline of â‰¥3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.03). Women in the top quartile of the DASH score had decreased risk for rapid eGFR decline (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80), but had no association with microalbuminuria.
