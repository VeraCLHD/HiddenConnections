After taking the tea, the trend was an increase in oxalate and citrate in both groups and uric acid excretion and clearance in the NS group. In the RS group, both uric acid excretion and clearance were significantly increased (p<0.01). When the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUa) was calculated, the values were clearly increased in both the NS and SF groups after the intake of tea and returned to baseline values in the washout period.
