Abstract BACKGROUND: Xenobiotic organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are a major environmental problem because of their historic widespread use, pronounced persistence against chemical and biological degradation, and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Pesticide use is prevalent in the production of edible bamboo shoots, which are exported widely from China. To evaluate the quality of Chinese bamboo shoots we determined the residual content of some OCPs in shoot samples.
