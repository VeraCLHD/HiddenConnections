By aid of this method, the levels of androgens in different tissues of Iranian native cross-breed bulls and male sheep were determined. According to the results obtained in the present study, although the androgenic profile (contents and ratios of precursors and metabolites to the main hormones) is similar between the same tissues of both animals, the total androgenic content of each tissue is higher in the bull than the same tissue in male sheep. In addition, in both animals higher amount of androgens were found in liver in comparison with meat and testis.
