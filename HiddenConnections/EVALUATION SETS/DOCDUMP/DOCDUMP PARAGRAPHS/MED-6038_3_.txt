RESULTS: Non occupational MPM in subjects living in areas contaminated by a variety of asbestos and non asbestos fibres has been well documented through a number of epidemiologic studies including cases series, case-control studies, and a cohort study. In addition, the observation of familial clustering of MPM, suggests that genetic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. The epidemiological evidence also suggests that MPM may occur as a result of the interaction between environmental carcinogens, genetic factors, and virus infection.
