Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Among the mentally ill, smoking prevalence is highest in patients with schizophrenia ( approximately 70-80%). This can impose a significant financial burden on patients, not to speak of increased smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is critical for clinicians to understand why patients with schizophrenia smoke in order to adapt treatment schemes.
