Frequency of colon cancer (also other non-infective bowel diseases, e.g. appendicitis) is very low in rural and urban blacks, is low in Indians and coloureds, yet much higher in whites. Thus, in these different ethnic populations, rarity or low frequency of colon cancer is associated more with low faecal pH than with level of dietary fibre intake, suggesting that components additional to fibre have a role in determining the milieu int√©rieur of the bowel and its proneness to disease.
