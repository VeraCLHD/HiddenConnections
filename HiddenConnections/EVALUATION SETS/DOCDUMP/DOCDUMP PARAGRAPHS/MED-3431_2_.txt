Recommendations are made regarding several characteristics of dry eye questionnaires that might be suitable for use in epidemiological studies and randomized controlled clinical trials. Risk factors for dry eye and morbidity of the disease are identified, and the impact of dry eye disease on quality of life and visual function are outlined. Suggestions are made for further prospective research that would lead to improvement of both eye and general public health.
