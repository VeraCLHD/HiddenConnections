FINDINGS: Bereavement represents a time of heightened cardiovascular risk for the surviving spouse. The immediate weeks following bereavement represent the highest risk period with both men and women across all ages. Risk is evident irrespective of the nature of death, expected or unexpected, although higher level of social support at the time of death may be protective.
