Abstract PIP: In the article by Rogan et al. on pollutants in breast milk, the statement that "there are no obvious...dietary predictors" of chemical pollutants in human milk is challenged by recent unpublished data on vegetarian women. We studied 12 woman who were all members of a religious community that eliminates all animal products from the diet and uses soybeans and grains for proteins. Samples of breast milk were gathered in August 1979 and were analyzed for 17 chemical substances.
