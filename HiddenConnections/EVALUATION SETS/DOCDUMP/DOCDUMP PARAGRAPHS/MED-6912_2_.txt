Mean concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in foodstuffs were in the range of 0.05-1.99 ng/g fresh wt and 0.06-12.5 ng/g fresh wt, respectively. The mean concentrations of PFOA, perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), and PFOS in indoor dust were 205, 14.0, and 4.86 ng/g, dry wt, respectively. The estimated daily intake of PFOS and PFOA from meat, meat products and eggs (EDI(meat&eggs)) ranged from 6.00 to 9.64 ng/d and from 254 to 576 ng/d, respectively, when the values below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) were assigned as 0, and from 8.80 to 15.0 ng/d and from 255 to 577 ng/d, respectively, when the values below the LOQ were set at 1/2LOQ.
