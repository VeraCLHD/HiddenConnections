Evaluation of these histological sections by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined the parasite to be a nematode of the genus Gnathostoma. The patient underwent a systemic work-up for gnathostomiasis, including imaging, and no other abnormalities were found. She completed a 3-week course of albendazole and has remained asymptomatic since the biopsy of her abdominal lesion.
