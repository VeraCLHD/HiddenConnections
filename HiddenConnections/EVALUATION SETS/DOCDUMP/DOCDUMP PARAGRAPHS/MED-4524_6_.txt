RESULT(S): In seminal plasma, ascorbate contributes almost twice as much as urate and thiol levels are about one third of ascorbate. Ascorbate levels in seminal plasma of asthenozoospermic individuals (+ROS) are significantly reduced. In sperm, thiols contributed most and ascorbate only a fraction of the total.
