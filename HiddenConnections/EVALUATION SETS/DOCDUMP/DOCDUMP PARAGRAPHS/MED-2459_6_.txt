Changes of both blood glucose (P = 0.0007) and FMD (P = 0.046) were significantly lower after administration of acarbose. Subgroup analysis revealed that the effect of acarbose was restricted to those subjects with an increase of blood glucose above the median increase of glycaemia. No changes of plasma ADMA were observed.
