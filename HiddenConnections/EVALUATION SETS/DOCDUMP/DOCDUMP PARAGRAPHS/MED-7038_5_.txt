The diets differed in phytosterol content (phytosterol-poor diet, 126 mg phytosterols/2000 kcal; phytosterol-abundant diet, 449 mg/2000 kcal) but were otherwise matched for nutrient content. Cholesterol absorption and excretion were determined by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry after oral administration of stable isotopic tracers. Results The phytosterol-abundant diet resulted in lower cholesterol absorption [54.2 ± 2.2 % (95% confidence interval, 50.5%, 57.9%) vs. 73.2 ± 1.3% (69.5%, 76.9%), P<0.0001] and 79% higher fecal cholesterol excretion [1322 ± 112 (1083.2, 1483.3) vs. 739 ± 97 mg/day (530.1, 930.2), P<0.0001] relative to the phytosterol-poor diet.
