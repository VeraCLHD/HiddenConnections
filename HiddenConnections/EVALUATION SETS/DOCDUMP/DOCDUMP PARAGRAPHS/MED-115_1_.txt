METHODS: I review meta-analyses in which response to antidepressant medication and response to placebo were calculated. RESULTS: All but one of these meta-analyses included unpublished as well as published trials. Most trials failed to show a significant advantage of SSRIs over inert placebo, and the differences between drug and placebo are not clinically significant for most depressed patients.
