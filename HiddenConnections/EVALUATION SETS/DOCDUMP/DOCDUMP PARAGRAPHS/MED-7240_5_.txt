If the fish meal contains sufficient NDMA, the incidence of liver failure or tumours can be quite high. Long-term exposure to as little as 0.1 mg NDMA/kg b.w./day in the diet of mink, cows and sheep can produce fibro-occlusive changes in the hepatic vessels. These lesions can later cause capillary ectasies-like changes in cows, which are similar in appearance to hemangiomas seen in mink.
