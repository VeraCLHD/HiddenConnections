Study Design Subgroup analysis from a prospective observational cohort study Setting and Participants Female participants in the Nursesâ€™ Health Study who had dietary patterns data from food frequency questionnaires returned in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998 and urinary albumin-creatinine ratios (ACR) from the year 2000 (n=3121); estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change between 1989 and 2000 was available in 3071. Predictor Prudent (higher intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole grains), Western (higher intake of red and processed meats, saturated fats, and sweets), and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style dietary patterns (also greater intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains). Outcomes and Measurements Microalbuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio 25 to 354 mcg/mg) in 2000 and change in kidney function by eGFR between 1989 and 2000.
