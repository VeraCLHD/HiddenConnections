We previously reported PCDD/Fs in individual analyses of food samples from a number of countries, including the U.S., the former Soviet Union, and Vietnam. We also previously estimated daily intake of dioxins and related chemicals in Americans at various ages in these reports. In this paper, the levels of dioxins, dibenzofurans, dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs), selected dioxin-like PCBs, and DDE (a persistent metabolite of DDT) were measured in 12 pooled food samples from over 90 individual specimens collected from supermarkets throughout the United States during 1995.
