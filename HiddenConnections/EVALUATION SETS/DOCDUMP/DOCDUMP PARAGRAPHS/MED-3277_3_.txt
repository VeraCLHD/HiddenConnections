CT angiography was used to measure the stenosis of major intracranial arteries in the studied population. A mixed-effects regression model was used to analyze the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and the progression of MCI, which was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Activities of Daily Living scale. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and dementia progression.
