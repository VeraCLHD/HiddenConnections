The price paid for maintenance of acid-base homeostasis is renal tubulointerstitial injury, with subsequent decline in renal function and induction of hypertension. The tendency for metabolic acidosis that results from the changing dietary habits could be corrected by a shift toward more alkalinizing food. We hypothesize that promoting such a shift can prevent the epidemic of end-stage renal failure in diabetes.
