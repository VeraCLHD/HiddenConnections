To counterbalance ROS-mediated injury, an endogenous antioxidants defense system exists; however, when oxidation exceeds the control mechanisms, oxidative stress arises. Chronic and cumulative oxidative stress induces deleterious modifications to a variety of macromolecular components, such as DNA, lipids, and proteins. A primary mechanism of many chemotherapy drugs against cancer cells is the formation of ROS, or free radicals.
