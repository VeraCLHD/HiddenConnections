Abstract We describe a patient who presented with a history of unexplained exertional dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates. She was evaluated for interstitial lung disease, presumed to be idiopathic and underwent an open lung biopsy. The pathologic findings were compatible with exogenous lipoid pneumonia and her history revealed longstanding use of intranasal petroleum jelly (Vaseline) at bedtime.
