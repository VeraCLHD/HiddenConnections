Abstract OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, and irritable bowel syndrome in a clinical population of reproductive-age women. METHODS: A ten-page questionnaire was administered to a consecutive sample of women age 18-45 years who were approached in the waiting areas of two obstetrics and gynecology practices and three family medicine practices in central North Carolina. Of 701 women approached to fill out the questionnaire, 581 (83%) returned completed forms suitable for analysis.
