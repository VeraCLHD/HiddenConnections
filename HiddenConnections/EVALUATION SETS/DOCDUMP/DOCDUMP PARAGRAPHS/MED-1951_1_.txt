Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a popular nonpharmacological treatment but consensus of its use is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials using ginger for NVEP as published in PubMed and EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and all EBM reviews. Studies satisfying 3 criteria were selected: (1) randomized placebo-controlled design; (2) use of ginger or Z. officinale; and (3) extractable data on improvement in NVEP.
