METHODS: Eight hundred ten participants were randomly assigned to advice-only, established guidelines for blood pressure control (reduced sodium, increased physical activity), or established guidelines plus the DASH diet (increased fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, reduced fat). RESULTS: At 6 months, 11.7% of Advice-Only, 19.3% of Established, and 44.6% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals (P<0.0001). At 18 months, 33.5% of Established plus DASH met at least 3 goals.
