The comet assay was also modified to assess the antioxidant effect of kiwifruit in vitro by measuring the ability of an extract to interfere with oxidative damage to DNA induced by H2O2. Ex vivo, consumption of kiwifruit led to an increased resistance of DNA to oxidative damage induced by H2O2 in isolated lymphocytes, in comparison with lymphocytes collected after a control drink of water. No effect was seen on endogenous DNA damage.
