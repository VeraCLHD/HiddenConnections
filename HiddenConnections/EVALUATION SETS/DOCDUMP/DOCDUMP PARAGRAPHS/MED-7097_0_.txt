Abstract Sixty percent of the U.S. population experiences acute diarrheal illness each year, but little is understood regarding public knowledge and beliefs about the causes and treatment of these diseases. We performed a telephone survey of 2117 Tennessee residents regarding knowledge and practices associated with diarrheal illness. Bloody stool, dehydration, and persistent symptoms were the most common reasons for which the respondents would seek medical care.
