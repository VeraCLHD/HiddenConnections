When best-fit quadratic functions were used to describe changes in rated hunger in relation to intake within the meal, naltrexone abolished the positive linear component reflecting the initial stimulation of appetite without altering either intercept or the negative quadratic function.

Overall, these data suggest a specific role for opioids in the stimulation of appetite through palatability.
