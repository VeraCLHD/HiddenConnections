RESULTS: During 14+/-6 months of follow-up, 260 episodes of impending syncope were reported by 19 patients; the manoeuvres were self-administered by these patients in 98% of cases and were able to abort syncope in 99.6% of cases. Overall, 5 episodes of syncope occurred in 5 patients (17%), in 4 cases without and in 1 with activation of the manoeuvres. Syncope recurred in 4 (40%) of 10 patients aged >65 years versus only 1 (5%) of 19 patients aged < or =65 years, p=0.03.
