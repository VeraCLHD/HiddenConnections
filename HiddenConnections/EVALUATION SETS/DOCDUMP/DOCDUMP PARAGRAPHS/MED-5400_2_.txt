OP concentration was significantly associated with the consumption of cooking oil (beta = 0.62, P < 0.01) and fish oil capsules (beta = 0.39, P < 0.01) after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI). NP concentration was also significantly associated with the consumption of fish oil capsules (beta = 0.38, P < 0.01) and processed fish products (beta = 0.59, P < 0.01). The food pattern of cooking oil and processed meat products from factor analysis was strongly associated with OP concentration in human milk (P < 0.05).
