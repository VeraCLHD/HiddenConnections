Abstract The metabolic syndrome is a common complex entity that has emerged as a worldwide epidemic and major public health care concern with a prevalence of approximately 25% in the United States. There have been a number of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome but all center around the metabolic abnormalities of central obesity, hypertension, decreased high-density lipoproteins and elevated triglycerides with insulin resistance as the uniting physiologic factor. The importance of the metabolic syndrome is not just related to its high prevalence rate but also because it predicts the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
