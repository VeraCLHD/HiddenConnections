The prudent dietary pattern was not associated with microalbuminuria or eGFR decline. Limitations Study cohort included primarily older white women and generalizability of results would benefit from validation in non-whites and men. Conclusions A Western dietary pattern is associated with a significantly elevated risk for microalbuminuria and rapid kidney function decline whereas a DASH-style dietary pattern may be protective against rapid eGFR decline.
