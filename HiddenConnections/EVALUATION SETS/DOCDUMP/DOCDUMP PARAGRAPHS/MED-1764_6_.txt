RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the women died during follow-up, with 95% of deaths resulting from ovarian cancer. Circulating 25(OH)D concentrations (mean: 44 nmol/L) were significantly associated with age, state of residence, season of blood collection, and body mass index but not with tumor histology, stage or grade, or comorbidities. Higher 25(OH)D concentrations at diagnosis were significantly associated with longer survival (adjusted HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99 per 10 nmol/L), but there was no significant association with progression-free survival or for 25(OH)D measured after primary treatment.
