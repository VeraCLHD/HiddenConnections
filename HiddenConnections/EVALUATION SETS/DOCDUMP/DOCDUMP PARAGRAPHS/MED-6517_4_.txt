We assessed dietary and supplemental choline and betaine intake every four years using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate multivariate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided.
