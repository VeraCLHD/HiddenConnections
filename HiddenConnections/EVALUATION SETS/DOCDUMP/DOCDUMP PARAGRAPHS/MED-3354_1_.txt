This study sought to investigate the effect of some citrus peels' [grapefruit (Citrus paradisii), orange (Citrus sinensis) and shaddock (Citrus maxima)] extracts on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and proteasome activities in primary human colonic tumor (Caco-2) and the metastatic cell lines (LoVo and LoVo/ADR) in a bid to explain the possible mechanism by which the peels could manage/prevent colon cancer. METHODS: The inhibition of MMP and proteasome activities in the cells by the peel extracts, as well as the identification of phenolic compounds using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD), was determined. RESULTS: Orange peel extracts had the strongest inhibition of MMP in Caco-2 and LoVo cells, while shaddock had the least.
