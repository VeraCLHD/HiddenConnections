There was a significant (p-trend< .0001), graded, inverse association between the number of ideal cardiovascular health metrics at baseline and cancer incidence. Participants meeting goals for 6-7 ideal health metrics (2.7% of the population) had 51% lower risk of incident cancer than those meeting goals for 0 ideal health metrics. When smoking was removed from the sum of ideal health metrics, the association was attenuated with participants meeting goals for 5-6 health metrics having 25% lower cancer risk than those meeting goals for 0 ideal health metrics (p-trend = .03).
