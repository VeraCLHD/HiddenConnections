Balsamic vinegar had stronger 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging abilities and higher polyphenol concentrations than rice vinegar. Balsamic vinegar dramatically inhibited LDL oxidation by azoradicals and endothelial cell-mediated oxidation in vitro. Further, we assessed the anti-oxidative effect against LDL after balsamic vinegar consumption in human subjects.
