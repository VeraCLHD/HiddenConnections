Importantly, concentrations of BMAA (10-100 μM) that caused no toxicity alone potentiated methylmercury (3 μM) toxicity. In addition, concentrations of BMAA and methylmercury that had no effect by themselves on the main cellular antioxidant glutathione together decreased glutathione levels. Furthermore, the combined toxicity of methylmercury and BMAA was attenuated by the cell permeant form of glutathione, glutathione monoethyl ester.
