Abstract OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the phenolic content of virgin olive oil on endothelial reactivity. BACKGROUND: Endothelial-dependent vasodilatation is impaired during the postprandial state, and oxidative stress could play a key role in its development. METHODS: Twenty-one hypercholesterolemic volunteers received two breakfasts, using a randomized sequential crossover design.
