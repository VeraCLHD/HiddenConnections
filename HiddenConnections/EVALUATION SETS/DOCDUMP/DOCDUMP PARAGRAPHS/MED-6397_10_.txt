Mean severity changes from baseline in migraine-associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability at 2 and 6 hours were significantly (P < .001) in favor of acetaminophen over placebo; the percentage of patients with no symptoms at 2 and 6 hours statistically significantly favored acetaminophen in 6 of 8 comparisons. Adverse events, overall, and specifically for nausea, were reported more frequently in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen 1000 mg, a nonprescription drug, is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for episodic and moderate migraine headache.
