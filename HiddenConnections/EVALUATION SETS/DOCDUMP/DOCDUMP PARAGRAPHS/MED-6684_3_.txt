The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was confirmed (creatine kinase, 84,000 IU/L, positive urine myoglobin) with other potential causes ruled out. The signs and symptoms of the patient gradually resolved and he was discharged on hospital day 5. Assessment using the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale yielded a score of 3, indicating a possible relationship between the supplement and rhabdomyolysis.
