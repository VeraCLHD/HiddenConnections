Patients and Methods One hundred fifty-three patients admitted to a high-efficiency particulate air–filtered room (protected environment [PE]) to receive induction therapy for newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned to a diet containing no raw fruits or vegetables (cooked diet) or to a diet containing fresh fruit and fresh vegetables (raw diet). Stratification was based on the patients’ early risk of mortality (ERM) score. All patients received antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis and remained on study until they were discharged from the PE.
