Abstract The worldwide increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses an immense public health hazard leading to a variety of complications such as cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy and neuropathy. Diet, as a key component of a healthy human lifestyle, plays an important role in the prevention and management of T2DM and its complications. The dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various favourable functions such as anti-inflammatory effects, improving endothelial function, controlling the blood pressure, and reducing hypertriglyceridemia and insulin insensitivity.
