Abstract N-nitroso compounds are produced in the human large intestine, but little is known about the dietary modulation of their synthesis at this site. The effects of meat and resistant starch on the fecal excretion of N-nitroso compounds, measured as apparent total N-nitroso compounds (ATNC), were therefore investigated in a crossover study involving eight healthy men. Three controlled diets that differed in the amount of meat (40 or 600 g) and resistant starch (37 g added to 600 g meat diet) were fed in random order, and fecal ATNC, as well as fecal ammonia and parameters of bowel function, were measured after 19 days of dietary adaptation.
