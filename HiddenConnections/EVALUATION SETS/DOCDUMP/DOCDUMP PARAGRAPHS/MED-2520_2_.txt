This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-invasion effects of red rice extract fractions on cancer cells. It was found that at 100 Î¼g/ml of crude ethanolic extract (CEE), hexane fraction (Hex) and dichloromethane fraction (DCM) could reduce HT1080 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell invasion. Hex and DCM revealed higher potency levels than CEE, whereas an ethyl acetate fraction (EtOAc) had no effect.
