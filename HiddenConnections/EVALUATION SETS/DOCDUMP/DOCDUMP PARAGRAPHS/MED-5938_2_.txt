The calculated diets were compared with analyses of all foods combined into a single sample for each day. The laboratory analyses of choline and betaine in the whole-diet aliquots matched the estimated amounts in the diets that were calculated from the analyses of individual foods. These diets were adjusted for several levels of choline and betaine and were well accepted by research subjects who consumed them for a time period of up to 2 months.
