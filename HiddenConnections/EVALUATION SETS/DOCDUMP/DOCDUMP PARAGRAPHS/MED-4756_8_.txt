Non-drug approaches (n = 3495) were superior to drug-based approaches (n = 20,872) in diabetes prevention (0.52, 0.46-0.58 vs 0.70, 0.58-0.85, P < 0.05). There was no difference in risk of all-cause mortality in the intervention versus control group (0.96, 0.84-1.10) and no difference in CV death (1.04, 0.61-1.78). There was a non-significant trend towards reduction in fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.59, 0.23-1.50).
