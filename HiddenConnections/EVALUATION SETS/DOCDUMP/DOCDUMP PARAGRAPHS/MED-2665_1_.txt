As this trend continues unhindered, we will continue see a persistent rise in obesity-related metabolic effectsâ€”hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis.

The lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis, proposed over three decades ago, suggested that proteinuria, decreased albumin levels, and the resultant hyperlipidemia may cause a glomerulosclerosis similar to atherosclerosis.
