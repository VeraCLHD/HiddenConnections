Early menopausal symptoms were assessed using Greene scale and hot flashes were recorded in a diary before, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after intervention. RESULTS: The mean Greene score was significantly lower in the Hop group than the placebo group at the end of weeks 4 (adjusted difference: -10.0, 95% confidence interval: -11.1--8.9), 8 (-18.6, -20.1--17.1) and 12 (-23.4, -25.1--21.6). The number of hot flashes was significantly lower in the Hop group than the control group during the weeks 4 (-8.4, -9.8--7.1), 8 (-17.1, -14.9--19.3) and 12 (-23.8, -21.1--26.4).
