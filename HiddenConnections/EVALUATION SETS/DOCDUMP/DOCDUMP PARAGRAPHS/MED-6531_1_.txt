After a baseline interval of one menstrual cycle, both groups were fed a high fat diet (40% energy from fat) for four menstrual cycles per subject, followed by a similar interval on a low fat diet (20% energy from fat). There were no significant differences in self-reported menstrual symptoms between the two P/S groups. During both menses and the premenstrual week of the low fat dietary period there were significant decreases in self-reported symptoms associated with water retention.
