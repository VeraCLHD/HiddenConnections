Cholesterol content in cortex was determined by HPLC in a small, loosely age-matched group of Apo-E4 genotype-matched AD, CAD and non-HD subjects. SOD immunoreactivity was also assessed in a number of subjects. The Apo-E4 genotype frequency was increased in CAD, HyperT and AD compared to non-HD controls.
