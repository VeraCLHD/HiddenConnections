Median time to first flare was 67 days with belimumab versus 83 days with placebo (P = NS). In seropositive patients, 52-week mean SELENA-SLEDAI scores were decreased by 28.8% with belimumab versus 14.2% with placebo (P < 0.05), and physician's global assessment scores were improved by 32.7% with belimumab versus 10.7% with placebo (P < 0.05). Two Phase III studies were performed in seropositive SLE patients.
