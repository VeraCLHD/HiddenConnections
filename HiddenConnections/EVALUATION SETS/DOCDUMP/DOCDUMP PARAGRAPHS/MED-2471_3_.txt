Post-prandial dysmetabolism is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events even in nondiabetic individuals.

Specifically, a diet high in minimally processed, high-fiber, plant-based foods such as vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts will markedly blunt the post-meal increase in glucose, triglycerides, and inflammation.
