Although omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, their effects on the risk of AF are inconsistent.

METHODS: Using an extensive online search, we conducted a meta-analysis of new onset incident/recurrent AF following exposure to fish/fish oil or long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
