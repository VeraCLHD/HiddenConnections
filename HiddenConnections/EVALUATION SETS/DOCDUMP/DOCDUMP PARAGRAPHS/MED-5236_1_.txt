Survival under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions showed that 35% of the strains, mainly belonging to the species Lactobacillus plantarum maintained high cell densities. Selected strains did not affect the immune-mediation by Caco-2 cells. All strains stimulated all 27 immune-mediators by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
