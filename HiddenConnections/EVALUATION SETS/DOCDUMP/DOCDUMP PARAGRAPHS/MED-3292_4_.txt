The studies suggest that mid-life cardiovascular risk factors, and in particular elevated levels of blood pressure, increase the risk for late-life cognitive impairment and dementia.

To better understand which risk factors lead to disease initiation, progression and prognosis, a life course approach to the epidemiologic study of dementia is needed.
