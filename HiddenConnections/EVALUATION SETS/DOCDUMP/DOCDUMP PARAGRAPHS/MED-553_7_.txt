For total LDL and HDL particles, odds ratios predicting CHD benefit were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.47) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.81), respectively. Mean LDL and HDL particle sizes were not associated with CHD events. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of gemfibrozil on NMR-measured LDL and HDL particle subclasses, which are not reflected by conventional lipoprotein cholesterol measures, help to explain the demonstrated benefit of this therapy in patients with low HDL cholesterol.
