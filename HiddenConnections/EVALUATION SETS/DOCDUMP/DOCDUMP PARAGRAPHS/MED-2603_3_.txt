HAECs were pretreated with 10 μM of CRCs, Chl a+b, and aspirin (Asp) for 18 h followed by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (2 ng/mL) for 6 h, and U937 cell adhesion was determined. TNF-α–induced monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion was significantly inhibited by CRCs. Moreover, CRCs and Chl a+b significantly attenuated vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and IL-8 expressions.
