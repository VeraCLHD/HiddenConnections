Although there has been little consistent evidence of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity from in vitro and animal studies, a few epidemiologic reports have indicated potential health effects of glyphosate.

Detailed information on pesticide use and other factors was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire completed at time of enrollment (1993â€“1997).
