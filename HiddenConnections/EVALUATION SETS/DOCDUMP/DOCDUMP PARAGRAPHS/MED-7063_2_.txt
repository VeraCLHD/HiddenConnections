The goal of this article is to critically review published studies to determine if there is a role for DHEA supplementation in postmenopausal women. RECENT FINDINGS: Daily administration of oral DHEA achieves serum concentrations similar to those of women in their 20s. Several observational studies have shown that lower DHEA levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk in women; however, interventional trials show no improvement in atherosclerosis or cardiovascular risk factors, and a lowering of HDL cholesterol levels.
