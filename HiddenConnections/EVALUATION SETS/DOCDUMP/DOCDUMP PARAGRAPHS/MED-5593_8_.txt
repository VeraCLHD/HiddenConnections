The multivariate adjusted RR for GDM associated with every 0.5-mg per day of increase in intake was 1.22 (1.10â€“1.36). No significant associations were observed between total dietary, nonheme, or supplemental iron intake and GDM risk. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that higher prepregnancy intake of dietary heme iron is associated with an increased GDM risk.
