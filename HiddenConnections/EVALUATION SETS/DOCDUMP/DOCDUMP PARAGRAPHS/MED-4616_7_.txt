Also, a significant decrease in the mean of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo-B100 were seen in this group. In the BT group, only HDLc showed significant change (p = 0.002) at the end of the study and changes in the other measures were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that ST has a significant effect on blood lipid profile in patients with diabetes.
