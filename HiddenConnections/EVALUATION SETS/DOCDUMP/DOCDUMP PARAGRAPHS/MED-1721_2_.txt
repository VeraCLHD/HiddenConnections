Hexamers have been studied in planar and tubular arrays but the predicted pentamers have not been observed. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic analyses of two in vitro-assembled capsids of Rous sarcoma virus. Both are icosahedrally symmetric: one is composed of 12 pentamers; the other, of 12 pentamers and 20 hexamers.
