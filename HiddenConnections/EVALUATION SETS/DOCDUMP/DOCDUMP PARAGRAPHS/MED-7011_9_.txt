Because butyrate increased histone acetylation and phosphorylation of ERK in HT29 cells, inhibition of histone deacetylases and the influence on MAPK signalling are possible mechanisms of GST activation by butyrate. Functional consequences of this activation include a reduction of DNA damage caused by carcinogens like hydrogen peroxide or 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) in butyrate-treated colon cells. Treatment of colon cells with the supernatant from an in vitro fermentation of inulin increased GST activity and decreased HNE-induced DNA damage in HT29 cells.
