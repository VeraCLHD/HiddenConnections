RESULTS: The mean serum LDL cholesterol in periodontitis patients was found to be significantly higher (P < 0.001) as compared to that of the controls. The mean clinical attachment loss was positively correlated with serum LDL cholesterol (P < 0.01) and gingival index (P<0.05). The frequency of persons with pathologic values of LDL cholesterol was significantly higher in periodontitis patients compared with that of the controls.
