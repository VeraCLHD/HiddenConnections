OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether oral health education leaflets with a food and nutritional focus conform to existing UK national nutritional guidelines from the Department of Health (DoH), the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA). METHOD: A sample of 30 information leaflets, aimed at parents and children aged 3-16 years, was sourced during the winter of 2005-2006. A qualitative content analysis was carried out to identify key recommendations on type, frequency and quantity of food and drink and general diet-related health advice.
