Abstract In this review recent publications are cited for a number of antimutagens. The molecules surveyed are potential or proven "desmutagens" or "interceptors." These are biologically prevalent or synthetic molecules that are most often small metabolites proficient in binding to, or reacting with, mutagenic chemicals and free radicals.
