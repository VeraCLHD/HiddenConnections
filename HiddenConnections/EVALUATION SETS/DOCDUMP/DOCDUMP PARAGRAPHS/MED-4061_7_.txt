Thus, Avns might reduce colon cancer risk through inhibition of macrophage PGE(2) production and non-COX-related antiproliferative effects in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, Avns had no effect on cell viability of confluence-induced differentiated Caco-2 cells, which display the characteristics of normal colonic epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the consumption of oats and oat bran may reduce the risk of colon cancer not only because of their high fiber content but also due to Avns, which attenuate proliferation of colonic cancer cells.
