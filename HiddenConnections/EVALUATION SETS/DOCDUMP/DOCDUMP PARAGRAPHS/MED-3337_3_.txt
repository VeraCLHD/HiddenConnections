DESIGN: Laboratory study.Method This was an in vitro investigation in which five varieties of shop bought fruit smoothies, including a 'thickie' were investigated, with respect to their initial pH, titratable acidity and effect upon exposure to the surface microhardness and profile of extracted human teeth. In addition their performance was compared to negative (Volvic(â„¢) water) and positive (orange juice) control drinks as well as a homemade smoothie, based upon the recipe of one of the commercially bought drinks, from which ingredient omissions were made. RESULTS: The majority of the drinks investigated had a baseline pH below the critical pH of enamel (5.5) and required comparable volumes of 0.1M NaOH to raise their pH to neutrality as the positive control.
