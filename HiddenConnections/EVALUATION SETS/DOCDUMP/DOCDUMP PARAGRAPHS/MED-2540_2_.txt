Design We obtained biologic samples from a prospective Danish–Finnish cohort study on cryptorchidism from 1997 to 2001. We analyzed individual breast milk samples collected as additive aliquots 1–3 months postnatally (n = 130; 62 cryptorchid/68 healthy boys) for phthalate monoesters [mono-methyl phthalate (mMP), mono-ethyl phthalate (mEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (mBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (mBzP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (mEHP), mono-isononyl phthalate (miNP)]. We analyzed serum samples (obtained in 74% of all boys) for gonadotropins, sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone, and inhibin B. Results All phthalate monoesters were found in breast milk with large variations [medians (minimum–maximum)]: mMP 0.10 (< 0.01–5.53 μg/L), mEP 0.95 (0.07–41.4 μg/L), mBP 9.6 (0.6–10,900 μg/L), mBzP 1.2 (0.2–26 μg/L), mEHP 11 (1.5–1,410 μg/L), miNP 95 (27–469 μg/L).
