Telomere erosion is a central component of aging, and telomere-associated proteins regulate cellular senescence and survival. This study examines the effects of exercising on vascular telomere biology and endothelial apoptosis in mice and the effects of long-term endurance training on telomere biology in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57/Bl6 mice were randomized to voluntary running or no running wheel conditions for 3 weeks.
