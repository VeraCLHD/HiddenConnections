There was a significant negative correlation between OSI and BMD in lumbar and femoral neck region (r = -0.63, P < 0.001; r = 0.40, P = 0.018). The results of this study indicated that increased osteoclastic activity and decreased osteoblastic activity may be associated with an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant status in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Therefore, supplementation of antioxidant-enriched diet to the therapy might shed light on the development of novel therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis.
