Abstract It was previously reported that a methanol extract of Gloiopeltis furcata (MEGF), a kind of edible seaweed, inhibited the growth of several human cancer cell lines. In the present study, the effect of MEGF on the growth of human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and its effect on the cyclooxygenases (COXs) expression were investigated. MEGF markedly reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and induced the G2/M arrest of the cell cycle in a concentration dependent manner.
