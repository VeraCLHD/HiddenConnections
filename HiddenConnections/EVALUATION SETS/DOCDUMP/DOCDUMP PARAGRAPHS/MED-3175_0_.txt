Abstract Thirteen patients (7 males, 6 females, aged 17-68 years) affected by primary, steroid-resistant, nephrotic syndrome and normal renal function were treated with a vegan, low-protein (0.7 g/kg per day) diet supplemented with essential amino acids and Ketoanalogues (VSD) for 3.9 +/- 2.9 months. These patients were studied at the beginning (following an unrestricted protein diet (UPD) supplying about 1 g/kg per day of mixed proteins) and at the end of VSD period. Urinary protein excretion decreased from 8.7 +/- 2.6 to 5.6 +/- 2.4 g/day (P less than 0.01), serum total cholesterol from 334.6 +/- 97.1 to 275.6 +/- 49.4 mg/dl (P less than 0.05).
