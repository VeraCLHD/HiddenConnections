Those who consumed 3.4–9.9 g per day of alcohol had a 33% lower risk of death compared with non-drinkers (95% CI 0.50–0.90;ptrend=0.04). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that alcohol intake up to approximately one small drink per day does not negatively impact breast cancer-specific survival and a half drink per day is associated with a decreased risk of mortality from other causes.
