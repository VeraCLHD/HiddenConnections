Maximally adjusted effect estimates were extracted; separate analyses were performed for high and moderate adherence. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible studies were included (11 covered stroke, 9 covered depression, and 8 covered cognitive impairment; only 1 pertained to Parkinson's disease). High adherence to Mediterranean diet was consistently associated with reduced risk for stroke (RR = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.89), depression (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54-0.86), and cognitive impairment (RR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.43-0.83).
