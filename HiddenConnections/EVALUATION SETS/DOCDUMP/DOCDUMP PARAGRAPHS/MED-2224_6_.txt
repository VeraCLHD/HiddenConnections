At baseline, 51% (N = 197) of participants met or exceeded the recommended serum concentration of 20 ng/ml. By study end, 64% (N = 230) of overweight or obese women met this goal, as well as 83% (N = 20) of those whose weight loss achieved a normal BMI. These findings suggest that weight loss, presumably associated with a reduction in body fat, is associated with increased serum 25(OH)D concentration in overweight or obese women.
