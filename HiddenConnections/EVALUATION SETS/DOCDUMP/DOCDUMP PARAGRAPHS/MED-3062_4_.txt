Subjects were classified quartiles according to concentrations of carotenoids and subgroups according to risk factors. Hazard ratios of serum lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene were estimated by the Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for potential confounding factors. During the median 15.9-year follow-up, 122 deaths from CVDs, were identified among the cohort subjects.
