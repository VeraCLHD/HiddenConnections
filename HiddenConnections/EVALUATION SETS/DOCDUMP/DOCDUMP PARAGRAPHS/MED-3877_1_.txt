METHODS: Ninety-six ICSFs were randomly assigned a low animal protein diet (< 10% of total energy), a high-fiber diet (> 25 g/day), or a usual diet (control group); all patients were recommended to increase their fluid intake. Their daily urine compositions were analyzed at baseline and at four months. Compliance with dietary recommendations was checked by validated food frequency questionnaires.
