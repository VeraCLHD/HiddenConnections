Information on myocardial infarction was identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge and the Cause of Death registries. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: During the follow-up (September 1997-December 2007), we identified 1114 incident cases of myocardial infarction (321,434 person-years).
