Abstract A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with good repeatability.
