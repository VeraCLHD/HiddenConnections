Abstract Epidemiological studies indicate that fruit and vegetables are health-promoting and protective against disease, particularly cardiovascular disease and cancer. Possible plant nutrients providing this protection include antioxidants and dietary fibre. Clinical trials with antioxidant supplements give inconsistent results for protection against lung cancer in smokers, invasive cervical cancer, oesophageal and gastric cancers, colorectal polyps and coronary heart disease.
