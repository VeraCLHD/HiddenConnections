Compared with the 2001 to 2005 period, the 2006 to 2010 period witnessed a 47% increase in the rate of CDC and a 32% increase in the rate of colectomies. The LASSO algorithm identified the following predictors for colectomy: coagulopathy (odds ratio [OR] 2.71), weight loss (OR 2.25), teaching hospitals (OR 1.37), fluid or electrolyte disorders (OR 1.31), and large hospitals (OR 1.18). The predictors of mortality after colectomy were: coagulopathy (OR 2.38), age greater than 60 years (OR 1.97), acute renal failure (OR 1.67), respiratory failure (OR 1.61), sepsis (OR 1.40), peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.39), and congestive heart failure (OR 1.25).
