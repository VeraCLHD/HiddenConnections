Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: During an 11.7 years follow-up, 3097 incident cases of stroke, including 2482 cerebral infarctions and 450 intracerebral hemorrhages, were registered. The hazard ratios of total stroke and cerebral infarction for the highest compared with the lowest quintiles of heme iron intake were 1.16 (95% CI, 1.03-1.31; P trend=0.037) and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.00-1.31; P trend=0.089), respectively.
