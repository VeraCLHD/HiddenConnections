To explore whether the difference could be explained by interactions between diet and colonic bacterial flora, we compared randomly selected samples of healthy 50- to 65-y-old AAs (n = 17) with NAs (n = 18) and CAs (n = 17). Diet was measured by 3-d recall, and colonic metabolism by breath hydrogen and methane responses to oral lactulose. Fecal samples were cultured for 7-alpha dehydroxylating bacteria and Lactobacillus plantarum.
