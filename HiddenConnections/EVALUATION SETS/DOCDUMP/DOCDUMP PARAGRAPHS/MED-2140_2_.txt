All of these factors rather than a single one contribute to the inhibition of WT alpha-synuclein fibrillation induced by the flavonoid. The structural requirements that appear necessary to provide a flavonoid the ability to inhibit alpha-synuclein fibrillation were determined to be vicinal dihydroxyphenyl moieties, irrespective of the ring position where they are located. Flavonoids with three vicinal hydroxyl groups exhibited enhanced inhibitory effects on alpha-synuclein fibrillation.
