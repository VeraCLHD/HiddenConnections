Knowledge of our human bacterial environment is contributing to an understanding of a variety of disorders including obesity and metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, immunity, and neuronal development and behavior. The Human Microbiome Project is providing a genetic and ecological analysis and will serve as a parallel to the Human Genome Project. Exploration of the chemical space utilized by bacteria will contribute to the development of new small molecule therapeutic agents, including new antibiotics.
