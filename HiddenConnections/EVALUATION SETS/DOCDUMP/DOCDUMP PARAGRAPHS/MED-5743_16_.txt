Feed consumption by exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that by the controls. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma in all exposed groups of females, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma in 1,250-ppm males, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 1,250-ppm males and 625- and 1,250-ppm females were significantly greater than those in the control groups. The incidence of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was significantly increased in the 1,250-ppm females.
