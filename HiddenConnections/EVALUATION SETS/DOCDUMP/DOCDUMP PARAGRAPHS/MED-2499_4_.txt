Non-pharmacologic options such as nerve or muscle stimulation should always be given consideration. Among the centrally acting analgesic drugs for many years mainly the tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), carbamazepine, gabapentin, and opioids have been used to treat neuropathic pain. More recently, significant pain relief has been reported in clinical trials of painful diabetic neuropathy using agents such as the dual selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin, a specific modulator of the alpha(2)delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channels.
