Soy consumption (-0.40% increment/additional gram consumed, 95% CI: -0.66, -0.14) was inversely associated with di-2-ethylhexylphthalate, while poultry (+0.23% increment/additional gram consumed, 95% CI: +0.12, +0.35) was positively associated. Findings were robust to examination of metabolite concentrations per unit body mass index and weight, and inclusion of fasting time. CONCLUSIONS: Diet contributes to urinary phthalate concentrations in children and adolescents.
