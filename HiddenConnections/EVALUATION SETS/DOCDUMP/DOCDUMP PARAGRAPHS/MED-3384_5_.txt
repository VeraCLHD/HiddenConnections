Overall recovery of ingested polyphenols and D-(-)-quinic acid in the ileostomy bags was 63.3Â±16.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The amounts of polyphenol and D-(-)-quinic acids reaching the ileostomy bags are considerably higher after apple smoothie consumption than after the consumption of cloudy apple juice or cider. These results suggest that the food matrix might affect the colonic availability of polyphenols, and apple smoothies could be more effective in the prevention of chronic colon diseases than both cloudy apple juice and apple cider.
