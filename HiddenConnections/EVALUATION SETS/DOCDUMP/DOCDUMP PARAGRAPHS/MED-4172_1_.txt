CD is thought to result from complex interactions between environmental factors, the gut microbes, and the genetic background and the immune system of the host. In the last decades research on these pathogenetic components, and especially on mucosal immunity, has led to the development of biologic agents and therapeutic strategies that have improved dramatically the treatment of CD but we are still far away from curing the disease. If there is a treatment for CD that will probably evolve through methodical steps towards integrating research on all the components involved in the pathogenesis of CD.
