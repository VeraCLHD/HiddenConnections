Oxidant stress plays a pivotal role in atherogenesis, however, the clinical promise of antioxidant vitamins has failed to translate into clinical benefit. Increasing evidence suggests that more rigorous clinical trial designs are necessary to effectively divulge antioxidant utility and that a multifaceted antioxidant approach to atherosclerosis may yield the most clinical reward. This article reviews currently available evidence on the role of oxidant stress in atherosclerosis, analyzes the results of large anti-oxidant trials, and suggests ways to investigate the true role of antioxidant treatment in the clinical setting.
