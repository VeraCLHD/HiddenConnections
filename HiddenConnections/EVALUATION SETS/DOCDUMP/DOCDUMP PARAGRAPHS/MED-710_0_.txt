Abstract Intestinal transit has a substantial influence on the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and steroid hormones, on colonic pH, and on short chain fatty acid concentrations in the distal colon. Slow transit is likely to favor disease processes that are related to over-efficient enterohepatic recirculation and to lack of short chain fatty acid in the distal colon. These include gallstones, large bowel cancer, and possibly breast cancer.
