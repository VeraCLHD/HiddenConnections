Abstract Many patients with atopic dermatitis are dissatisfied with conventional treatments based on topical steroids and have experienced some traditional remedies and alternative therapies. However, most of such therapies have not been evaluated scientifically and clinically by specialists. This study was designed to assess whether a certain vegetarian diet might be effective for atopic dermatitis and if so, to identify the mechanisms of this remedy through analyses of immunological parameters.
