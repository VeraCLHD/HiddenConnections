Sex steroids, including estrone, estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) capacity, free testosterone concentration, and luteinizing hormone (LH) were determined by either specific radioimmunoassay or dialysis. The fat-containing meal, but not the nonnutritive or mixed carbohydrate and protein meal, resulted in a significant (P less than .01) reduction in total and free testosterone. Estrogens and luteinizing hormone were unaffected by either meal.
