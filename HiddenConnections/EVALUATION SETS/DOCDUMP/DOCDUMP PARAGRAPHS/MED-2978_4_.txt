The role of many individual nutrients, foods, and food groups in inducing satiety has been extensively studied. Based on this evidence, we have developed sample weight-loss meal plans that include multiple satiating foods, which may collectively augment the satiating properties of a meal. Compared to a typical American diet, these meal plans are considerably lower in energy density and probably more satiating.
