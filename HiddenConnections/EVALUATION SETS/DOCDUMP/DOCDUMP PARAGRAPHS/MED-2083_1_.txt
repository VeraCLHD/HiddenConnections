The effect of salt on endothelial function postprandially is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the postprandial effect of dietary salt on endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and peripheral arterial tonometry in healthy subjects. DESIGN: Sixteen healthy, normotensive subjects received a meal with added salt (HSM; 65 mmol Na) and a control low-salt meal (LSM; 5 mmol Na) on 2 separate occasions in a randomized order.
