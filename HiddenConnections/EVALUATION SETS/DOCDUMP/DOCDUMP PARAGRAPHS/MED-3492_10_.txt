In contrast with the controls, despite postprandial increase in double product (HR x blood pressure), Dtvi and Dtvi x HR in the patient group decreased after food intake, with a nadir value at 45 min. Fasting values and nadir values at 45 min were significantly different (Dtvi: 24.0 +/- 19.6 cm/s vs. 19.3 +/- 17.1 cm/s, p < 0.001, Dtvi x HR: 1,449.6 +/- 1,044.0 cm/min vs. 1,273.4 +/- 1,000.9 cm/min, p = 0.002). In six patients, the CBF pattern resumed the normal pattern of postprandial surge in the CBF after successful coronary intervention.
