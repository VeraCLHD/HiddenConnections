Hair mercury concentrations were correlated to both the number of monthly seafood servings and the estimated ingested mercury dose. RESULTS: There were significant correlations between fish servings and hair mercury (Spearman r=0.73, P<.0001) and between amounts of consumed mercury and hair mercury concentrations (Spearman r=0.81, P<.0001). Nearly two thirds of the Motherisk callers, all of the Japanese women, and 15% of the Canadian women of reproductive age had hair mercury above 0.3 microg/g, which was shown recently to be the lowest observable adverse effect level in a large systematic review of all perinatal studies.
