In the presence of catechin or red wine polyphenols, metmyoglobin catalyzed the breakdown of hydroperoxides to zero, totally preventing lipid peroxidation and beta-carotene cooxidation. We suggest that human gastric fluid may be an excellent medium for enhancing the oxidation of lipids and other dietary constituents. The results indicate the potentially harmful effects of oxidized fats intake in the presence of endogenous catalysts found in foods, and the major benefit of including in the meal plant dietary antioxidants.
