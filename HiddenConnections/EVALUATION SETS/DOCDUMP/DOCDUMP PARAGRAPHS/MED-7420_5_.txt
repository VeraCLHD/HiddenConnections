Subjects: One hundred forty-one subjects (78 vegetarians, 63 vegans) were recruited; one vegan was excluded. Results: Median urinary iodine concentration of vegans (78.5 μg/liter; range 6.8–964.7 μg/liter) was lower than vegetarians (147.0 μg/liter; range 9.3–778.6 μg/liter) (P < 0.01). Adjusted for cigarette smoking (confirmed by urinary cotinine levels) and thiocyanate-rich food consumption, median urinary thiocyanate concentration of vegans (630 μg/liter; range 108-3085 μg/liter) was higher than vegetarians (341 μg/liter; range 31–1963 μg/liter) (P < 0.01).
