Abstract MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) causes selective destruction of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway in humans and other primates. It is less specific and much less potent in mice and has only slight effects in rats. Differences in rates and sites of metabolism of MPTP to its active, toxic, highly polar metabolite, MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine), appear to influence species specificity.
