Abstract Quantitative studies of retinal vascular caliber using new computer-assisted retinal imaging systems have allowed physicians and researchers to understand the influence of systemic, environmental, and genetic factors on retinal vascular caliber. Retinal vascular caliber changes reflect cumulative response to aging, cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, nitric oxide-dependent endothelial dysfunction, and other processes. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that changes in retinal arteriolar and venular caliber size may reflect the differential effects of a range of systemic, environmental, and genetic risk factors.
