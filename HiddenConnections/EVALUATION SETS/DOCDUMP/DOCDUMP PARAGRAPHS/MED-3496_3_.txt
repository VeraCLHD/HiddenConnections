RESULTS: Postprandial serum triglyceride level increased significantly at 2-7 h and mean flow-mediated vasodilatation was impaired significantly (from 4.22 +/- 0.44 to 2.75 +/- 0.33%, P < 0.01) for 75 subjects. The increment in 2 h serum triglyceride level correlated positively with the decrement in postprandial flow-mediated vasodilatation (r = 0.459, P < 0.01). Postprandial triglyceride level was significantly higher in CAD patients than in control participants.
