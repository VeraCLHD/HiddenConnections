Concentrations (~2 μg/g creatine) and calculated BPA intakes (~0.03 μg/kg-day) in these individuals during the first 24h were consistent with general population exposures. For the second 24h, concentrations and intakes declined by about two-thirds. One of the individuals had an extraordinary pre-fast exposure event with concentrations rising as high as 98 μg/g creatine but declining to <5 μg/g creatine by day 2.
