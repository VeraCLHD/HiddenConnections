Abstract Single dose administration of dietary inorganic nitrate acutely reduces blood pressure in normotensive healthy volunteers, via bioconversion to the vasodilator nitric oxide. We assessed whether dietary nitrate might provide sustained blood pressure lowering in hypertensive patients.We randomly assigned 68 hypertensive patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to receive daily dietary supplementation for 4-weeks with either dietary nitrate (250mL daily, as beetroot juice) or a placebo (250mL daily, as nitrate-free beetroot juice) following a 2-week run-in period and followed by a 2-week wash-out. We performed stratified randomization of drug-na√Øve (n=34) and treated (n=34) hypertensive patients aged 18-85 years.
