Fruit peels were found to accumulate high levels of naringenin chalcone, implicating the limitation of naringenin substrates for isoflavone synthesis. Our results suggested that tomato plants could be engineered to produce isoflavones without comprising the levels of endogenous flavonols, which are also health-beneficial, but it may be necessary to enhance the expression levels of chalcone isomerase simultaneously to achieve significant yields in edible tissues such as fruit peels.
