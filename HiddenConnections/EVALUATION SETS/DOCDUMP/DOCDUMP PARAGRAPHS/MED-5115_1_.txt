This review concentrates on the oncological implications of research concerning the alpha gal triad; the alpha 1-->3 galactosyl epitope (alpha Gal), the enzyme responsible for its construction, alpha 1,3 galactosyl transferase (alpha 1-3GT), and its associated antibody: anti-gal. Alpha gal epitopes, previously assumed to be absent from human tissue, have been demonstrated on several human cancer cell lines, senescent red blood cells, and Graves' disease thyrocytes. Alpha-gal presence on neoplastic lines is correlated with increased metastatic formation in animal models.
