The target microorganism was monitored in the fecal microbiota via quantitative PCR (qPCR). L. plantarum was detected and quantified in all of the subjects during the ingestion periods. The differences between the L. plantarum levels at time zero and during all the different ingestion periods were statistically significant (P = 0.001).
