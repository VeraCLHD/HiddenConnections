There seems to be no major differences in HRQoL based on IBS subtype (constipation-dominant or diarrhea-dominant). However, the severity of bowel symptoms in IBS is associated with a corresponding impact on HRQoL and patients with worse bowel symptoms have a greater diminished QoL compared with patients with milder symptoms. Evidence also indicates that HRQoL in patients with IBS is affected by sex and psychological conditions.
