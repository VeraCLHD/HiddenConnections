Main outcome measures Breathing rate, ventilation, carbon dioxide, RR interval, blood pressure, mid‐cerebral artery flow velocity, and baroreflex. Results Ventilation, blood pressure, and heart rate increased and mid‐cerebral artery flow velocity and baroreflex decreased with faster tempi and simpler rhythmic structures compared with baseline. No habituation effect was seen.
