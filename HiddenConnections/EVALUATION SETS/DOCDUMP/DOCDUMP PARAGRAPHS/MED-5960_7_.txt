Results: KCitrate completely neutralized the acid load imparted by HPD (based on changes in urine pH and net acid excretion) and increased urinary citrate. Urinary calcium increased during both HPD phases compared with CD but was not significantly different between the HPD + KCl and HPD + KCitrate phases (182 ± 85 vs. 170 ± 85 mg/d; P = 0.28). Increased urinary saturation with respect to calcium oxalate and uric acid with HPD was abrogated by KCitrate.
