Diagnoses of non-melanoma skin cancer (n=129,206), cutaneous malignant melanoma (n=22,107), myocardial infarction (n=327,856), hip fracture (n=129,419), and deaths from any cause (n=1,629,519) were drawn from national registries. RESULTS: In individuals with vs without non-melanoma skin cancer, multifactorially adjusted odds ratios were 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-0.98) for myocardial infarction and 1.15 (1.12-1.18) for hip fracture, and the multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio was 0.52 (0.52-0.53) for death from any cause. Risk of hip fracture was reduced (odds ratios were below 1.0) in individuals below age 90 years.
