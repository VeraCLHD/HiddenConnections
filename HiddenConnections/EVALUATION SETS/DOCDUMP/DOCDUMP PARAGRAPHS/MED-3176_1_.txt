In seven additional subjects the acute renal, metabolic and hormonal response to ingestion of a meat or soya load of equivalent total protein content was investigated (acute study). In the chronic study GRF, RPF and fractional clearance of albumin and IgG were significantly higher on the animal than the vegetable protein diets (GFR: 121 +/- 4 vs. 111 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.001; RPF: 634 +/- 29 vs. 559 +/- 26 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.001; theta alb: 19.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 10.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(-7), P less than 0.01; theta IgG: 11.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 x 10(-7), P less than 0.05). Renal vascular resistance was lower on the animal than vegetable protein diet (82 +/- 5 vs. 97 +/- 5 mmHg/min/liter; P less than 0.001).
