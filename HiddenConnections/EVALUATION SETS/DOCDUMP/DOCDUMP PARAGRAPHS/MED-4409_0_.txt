Abstract STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis of the feeding arteries of the lumbar spine and cholesterol levels on patients with long-term nonspecific lower back pain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether occlusion of lumbar and middle sacral arteries or serum cholesterol levels are associated with lower back pain and/or with disc degeneration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Atherosclerosis in the wall of the abdominal aorta usually develops at the ostia of branching arteries and the bifurcation, and may obliterate orifices of lumbar and middle sacral arteries.
