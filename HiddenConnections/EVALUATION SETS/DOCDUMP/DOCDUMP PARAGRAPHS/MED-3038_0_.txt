Abstract The purpose of this exploratory study was to survey physicians' attitudes surrounding the 'gift relationship' between pharmaceutical companies and physicians. A survey was mailed to 1000 randomly selected West Virginia physicians, of which 283 (28.3%) responses were received. The most commonly received gifts reported by the study physicians were trinkets (77.4%), followed by books (41.7%) and meals (41%).
