The 24-hour protein excretion was similar on the two diets. The two low-protein diets resulted in a slowing in the progression of CRF. A VPD is well tolerated in CRF and is associated with lower protein and phosphate intakes and a higher caloric intake than an APD and may, therefore, be used as a safe alternative or partial substitute for the usual APD in CRF.
