A total of 1449 persons (73%), 65 to 79 years of age, participated in the reexamination in 1998 (mean follow-up, 21 years). MEASUREMENTS: Midlife blood pressure and total cholesterol level, apoE genotype, and development of Alzheimer disease during follow-up. RESULTS: The apoE epsilon4 allele was an independent risk factor for Alzheimer disease, even after adjustment for midlife vascular risk factors and other confounders (odds ratio, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.1 to 4.1]).
