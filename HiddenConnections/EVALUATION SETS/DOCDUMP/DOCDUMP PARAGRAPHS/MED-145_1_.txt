OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relation between nut intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes, CVD, and all-cause mortality. DESIGN: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for all prospective cohort studies published up to March 2013 with RRs and 95% CIs for outcomes of interest. A random-effects model was used to pool risk estimates across studies.
