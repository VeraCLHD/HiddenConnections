Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive technique for the assessment of endothelial function. The objective of the study was to use the above method to evaluate the pathophysiology of high-fat (HF) intake on endothelial function in a local population. A popular local dish "nasi-lemak", a source of high saturated fat content from coconut milk, was chosen to represent a local high-fat meal (LHF).
