During summit day, subjects climbed at an intensity equivalent to approximately 42% of their high altitude predicted maximal oxygen consumption at 5100 m). CONCLUSIONS: During a high altitude expedition, subjects predominantly exercise at a moderate intensity, with limited time spent at higher intensity levels. Use of accelerometer-based technology may provide more cost-effective and logistically easier means of assessing EE in extreme environments.
