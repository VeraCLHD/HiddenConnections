The eNOS activity was unaffected in the presence of equal milliosmol of mannitol, which excludes an osmotic effect. Using an ex vivo aortic angiogenesis assay, we demonstrated that salt attenuated the nitric oxide (NO)-dependent proliferation of endothelial cells. By directly monitoring blood pressure changes in response to salt infusion, we found that in vivo infusion of salt induced an acute increase in blood pressure in a salt concentration-dependent manner.
