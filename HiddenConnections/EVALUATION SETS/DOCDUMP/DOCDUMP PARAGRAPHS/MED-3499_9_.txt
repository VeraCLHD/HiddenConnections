The ejection fraction was lower as well in these patients (0.39 vs. 0.47, p = 0.046). Postprandial angina occurred at rest and on exertion, most commonly after dinner. CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial angina is a likely marker of severe coronary artery disease and should be considered an indication for coronary angiography.
