In men without hyperlipidemia treatment, sciatica was associated with total cholesterol (high vs. low tertile: OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.14-4.55), LDL cholesterol (2.12; 1.11-4.05), and triglycerides (1.92; 1.04-3.55), adjusted for age, BMI, exercise, smoking, heavy physical work, and education. HDL was not associated with sciatica. For men in the highest tertile of both total cholesterol and triglycerides, the OR of sciatica was 3.89 (1.68-8.99) in comparison to men with cholesterol in the lowest tertile and triglycerides in the lowest or the middle tertile.
