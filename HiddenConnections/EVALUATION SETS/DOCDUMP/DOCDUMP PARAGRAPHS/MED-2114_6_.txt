At the onset of the study all phthalate metabolite concentrations were consistent with levels found in previous general population studies. Metabolites of the HMW phthalates (DEHP, DiNP and DiDP) showed a rapid decline to levels 5-10 times lower than initial levels within 24h of the fast and remained low thereafter. After food consumption resumed, levels rose again.
