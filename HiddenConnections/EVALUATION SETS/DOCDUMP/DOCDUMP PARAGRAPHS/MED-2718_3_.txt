The concentration required for 50% inhibition of the platelet aggregation for garlic was calculated to be approximately 6.6 mg ml(-1) plasma, whereas the concentration for onion was 90 mg ml(-1) plasma. Boiled garlic and onion extracts showed a reduced inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. Garlic but not onion significantly inhibits human platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion.
