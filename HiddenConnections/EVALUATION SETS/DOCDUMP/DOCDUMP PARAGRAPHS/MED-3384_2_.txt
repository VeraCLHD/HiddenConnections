Their ileostomy bags were collected directly before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after smoothie consumption, and the polyphenol and D-(-)-quinic acid contents of the ileostomy fluids were examined using HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS. The total polyphenol and D-(-)-quinic acid content of the apple smoothie was determined to be 1955.6±124.6 mg/0.7 L, which is very high compared to cloudy apple juices. The most abundant substances found in the ileostomy bags were oligomeric procyanidins (705.6±197.9 mg), D-(-)-quinic acid (363.4±235.5 mg) and 5-caffeoylquinic acid (76.7±26.8 mg).
