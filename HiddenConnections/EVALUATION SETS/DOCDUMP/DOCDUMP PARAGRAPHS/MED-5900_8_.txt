Similarly, exercise increased T helper cells (controls, 248 (60) cells/μl; children with asthma, 232 (53) cells/μl) and most other lymphocyte subtypes tested. By contrast, although basophils (16 (5) cells/μl) and CD4+ CD45RO+ RA+ lymphocytes (19 (4) cells/μl) increased in controls, no increase in these cell types was found in children with asthma. Conclusions Exercise increased many circulating inflammatory cells in both children with asthma and controls.
