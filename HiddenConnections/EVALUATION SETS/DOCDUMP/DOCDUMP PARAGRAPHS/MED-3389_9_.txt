A significant increase in plasma folate concentration was found only after consumption of the spinach-supplemented meal, which provided the highest level of folate. Disruption of the spinach matrix increased the plasma responses to both lutein (14 (95% CI 3.7, 25)%) and folate (10 (95% CI 2.2, 18)%), whereas it did not affect the response to beta-carotene. We conclude that the bioavailabilities of beta-carotene and lutein vary substantially among different vegetables and that the bioavailabilities of lutein and folate from spinach can be improved by disruption of the vegetable matrix.
