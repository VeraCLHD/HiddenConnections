In addition, in a low metabolic risk subgroup, the HRs for all-cause mortality and total cardiovascular morbidity were 1.24 (P = 0.02) and 1.48 (P = 0.16), respectively. CONCLUSION: Hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor of mortality from all causes, total CVD, and ischemic stroke in the Taiwanese general population, in high-risk groups, and potentially in low-risk groups.
