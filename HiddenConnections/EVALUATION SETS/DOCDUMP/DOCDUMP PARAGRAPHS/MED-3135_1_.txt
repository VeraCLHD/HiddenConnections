We evaluated their efficacy and feasibility during daily life in a group of 29 consecutive patients affected by vasovagal syncopes. METHODS: The patients were trained to use arm tensing and/or handgrip in case of occurrence of symptoms of impending syncope. RESULTS: During 14+/-6 months of follow-up, 260 episodes of impending syncope were reported by 19 patients; the manoeuvres were self-administered by these patients in 98% of cases and were able to abort syncope in 99.6% of cases.
