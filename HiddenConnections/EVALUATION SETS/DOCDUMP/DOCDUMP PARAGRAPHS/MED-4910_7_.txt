The summary RR was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84) for an increment of 1 cup of coffee per day. The inverse relationship between coffee and HCC risk was consistent regardless of the subjects' sex, alcohol drinking, or history of hepatitis or liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: From this meta-analysis, the risk of HCC is reduced by 40% for any coffee consumption vs no consumption.
