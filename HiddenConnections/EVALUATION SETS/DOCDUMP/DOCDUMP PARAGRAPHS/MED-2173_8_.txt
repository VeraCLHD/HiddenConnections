Subjects in the lower quartile of UVR exposure also were at increased risk for early AMD (OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.06-2.69; P = 0.03), by comparison with those with medium exposure. Associations of late AMD with UVR exposure was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study further confirms the increased risk for cataract extraction in subjects exposed to high ambient UVR.
