The overall mean (SD) was 24.8 (10.4) ng/ml, but lower for African-Americans [18.1 (8.7) ng/ml] and Hispanics [22.1 (9.2) ng/ml]. Women with localized (n=424) or regional (n=182) breast cancer had lower serum [25(OH)D] than women with in situ disease (n=184), (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Multivariate regression models controlled for age, BMI, race/ethnicity, geography, season, physical activity, diet and cancer treatments demonstrated that stage of disease independently predicted serum [25(OH)D] (p=0.02).
