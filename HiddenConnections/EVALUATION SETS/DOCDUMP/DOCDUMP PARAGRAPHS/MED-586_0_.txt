Abstract Late preterm (LP) birth (34 0/7 - 36 6/7 weeks' gestation) accounts for nearly three-fourths of all preterm births, making this population a sizeable public health concern. The immature fetal development associated with LP delivery increases the risk of mortality and short-term medical complications. Which combination of maternal, fetal, or neonatal risk factors may be most critical has only recently begun to be addressed, and whether LP birth's disruptive impact on brain development will exert adverse effects on neuropsychological functioning in childhood and adolescence has been understudied.
