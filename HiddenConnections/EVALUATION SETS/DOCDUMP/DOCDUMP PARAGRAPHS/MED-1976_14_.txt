In a model adjusted for age, CAG, and caloric intake, MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion (p for trend=0.14 for tertile of MeDi, and p=0.22 for continuous MeDi). When individual diet components of MeDi were analyzed, higher dairy consumption (hazard ratio 2.36; 1.0â€“5.57; p=0.051) and higher caloric intake (p=0.035) were associated with risk of phenoconversion. Conclusion and Relevance MeDi was not associated with phenoconversion, however higher consumption of dairy products had a two-fold increased risk, and may be a surrogate for lower urate levels (associated with faster progression in manifest HD).
