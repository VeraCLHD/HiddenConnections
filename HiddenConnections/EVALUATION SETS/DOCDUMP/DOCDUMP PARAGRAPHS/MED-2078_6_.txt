The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of Z- and leptin-induced proliferation of primary cultured human breast cancer epithelial cells (HBCECs). A cell proliferation assay was used to determine the extent to which Z is capable of enhancing the mitogenic activity of leptin in HBCECs. RT-PCR was used to explore the possible mechanisms by quantifying the transcription of cyclin D1 and ObR genes.
