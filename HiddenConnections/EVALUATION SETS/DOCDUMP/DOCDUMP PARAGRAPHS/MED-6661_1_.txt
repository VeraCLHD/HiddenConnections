The levodopa dose for each patient was not changed during the period of study, and no other antiparkinsonian drugs were used. Regular and high-protein diets resulted in a marked elevation in the plasma concentrations of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) that are known to compete with levodopa for transport across the blood-brain barrier. Despite elevated plasma levodopa levels, all patients with elevated LNAA levels experienced parkinsonian symptoms.
