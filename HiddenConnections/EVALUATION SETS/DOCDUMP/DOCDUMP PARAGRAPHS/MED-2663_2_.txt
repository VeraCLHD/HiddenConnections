Since 1982, increasing evidence has supported the hypothesis that lipid abnormalities contribute to both atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis. In this Review, we discuss research developments that are relevant to the lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis. We describe how inflammatory stress accompanying chronic kidney disease modifies lipid homeostasis by increasing cholesterol uptake mediated by lipoprotein receptors, inhibiting cholesterol efflux mediated by the ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 and impairing cholesterol synthesis in peripheral cells.
