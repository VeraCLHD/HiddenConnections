We measured point prevalence of endoscopic ulcers, after quantitating dyspeptic symptoms. Incidence was assessed 3 months later in those eligible to continue (no baseline ulcer or reason for gastroprotectants). RESULTS: In 187 patients, ulcer prevalence was 11% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.3-15.1%].
