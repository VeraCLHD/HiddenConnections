Abstract The notion that a breast-gut connection might modulate the microenvironment of breast tissue was supported by the finding that breast cyst fluid contains bile acids that are characteristically found in the intestines. To establish that the gut, rather than circulating steroid precursors, is the source of bile acids in breast cyst fluid, we gave two patients deuterium-labelled chenodeoxycholic acid (three 200 mg doses by mouth), starting 9 days before aspiration of breast cysts. The chenodeoxycholic acid concentration of seven samples of aspirated cyst fluid ranged from 42 to 94 mumol/L.
