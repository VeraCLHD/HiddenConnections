The important role of platelets in arterial thrombosis and the onset of acute myocardial infarction after atherosclerotic plaque rupture make inhibition of platelet aggregation a critical step in preventing thrombotic events associated with stroke, heart attack, and peripheral arterial thrombosis. However, the use of platelet inhibitors for thrombosis prevention must seek a delicate balance between inhibiting platelet activation and an associated increased bleeding risk. The aim of this review is to up-date the knowledge on platelets physiology and dysfunction in pathologies, such as diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, emphasizing the link between platelets and the inflammation-related atherosclerosis.
