Western blot analysis revealed that BPA increased the level of phosphorylated Akt kinase. Based on these findings, we concluded that BPA acted through the PI 3-kinase and Akt kinase pathway, resulting in increased TG accumulation and expression of adipocyte genes. The structure-activity relationship for BPA-related chemicals was examined.
