Serum and urine were obtained immediately before and then hourly over a 3 h period after ingestion of each study product. RESULTS: Ingestion of the soy control led to an increase in serum urate concentrations by approximately 10%. In contrast, ingestion of all milks led to a decrease in serum urate concentrations by approximately 10% (p<0.0001).
