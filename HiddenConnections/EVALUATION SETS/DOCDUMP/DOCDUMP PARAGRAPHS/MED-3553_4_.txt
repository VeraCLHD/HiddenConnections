Associations between whole-grain product intake and prostate cancer incidence were analyzed using Cox's regression model. RESULTS: Overall, there was no association between total intake of whole-grain products and prostate cancer risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio per 50 g day(-1): 1.00 (95% confidence interval: 0.96, 1.05)) as well as between intake of the specific whole-grain products: whole-grain rye bread, whole-grain bread, and oatmeal, and risk of prostate cancer. No risk estimates did differ according to either stage or grade of disease.
