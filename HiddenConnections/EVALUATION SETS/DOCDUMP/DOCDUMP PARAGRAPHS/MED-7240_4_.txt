Mink and fox may consume considerable amounts of fish meal in their diets. If the fish meal contains sufficient NDMA, the incidence of liver failure or tumours can be quite high. Long-term exposure to as little as 0.1 mg NDMA/kg b.w./day in the diet of mink, cows and sheep can produce fibro-occlusive changes in the hepatic vessels.
