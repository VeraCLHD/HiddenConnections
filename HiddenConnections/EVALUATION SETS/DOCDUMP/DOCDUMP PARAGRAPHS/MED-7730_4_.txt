While the etiology is unknown, it is felt to be a toxin. Palytoxin, found in marine fish, has been associated with rhabdomyolysis, and may serve as a model for further study of the suspected toxin responsible for rhabdomyolysis after consumption of fresh water fish. If a case of Haff disease is suspected, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and collect any uneaten fish, which may be sent for laboratory analysis.
