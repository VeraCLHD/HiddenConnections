RESULTS: The most prevalent symptoms were abdominal bloating, cramps or abdominal pain, irritability, mastalgia and joint/muscle/back pains. Severity of symptoms was directly proportional to duration (number of affected cycles) (R = 0.78). A linear model found that symptom prevalence (duration Ã— severity) was associated with age (linear and quadratic effects), parity, current smoking and country.
