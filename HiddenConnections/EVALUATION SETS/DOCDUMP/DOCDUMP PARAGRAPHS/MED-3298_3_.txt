Fetuses affected by an antenatal constriction of the ductus arteriosus (DC) may present with different signs of cardiac failure including dilated right ventricle, tricuspid regurgitation and abnormal venous Doppler. We report on four cases with prenatal DC, presenting at 34, 35, 36 and 37 weeks of gestation. They were referred to fetal echocardiography because of abnormal routine echo scans with unexplained signs of right heart decompensation.
