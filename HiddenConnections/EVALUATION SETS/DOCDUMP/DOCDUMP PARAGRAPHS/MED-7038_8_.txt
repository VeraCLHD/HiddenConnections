Plasma lathosterol/cholesterol ratio rose 82% [from 0.71 ± 0.11 (0.41, 0.96) to 1.29 ± 0.14 μg/mg (0.98, 1.53), (P<0.0001)]. LDL-cholesterol was similar between diets. Conclusions Intrinsic phytosterols at levels present in a healthy diet are biologically active and have large effects on whole body cholesterol metabolism not reflected in circulating LDL.
