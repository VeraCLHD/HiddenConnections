We examined the association between organic dietary choice during pregnancy and presence of hypospadias in the offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mothers of 306 boys operated on for hypospadias were frequency matched for geography and child birth year to 306 mothers of healthy boys in a case-control study. Telephone interviews were conducted regarding demographic and lifestyle factors, including intake and organic choice of selected food items (milk, dairy products, egg, fruit, vegetables and meat).
