We conducted an unblinded crossover study to establish AFB1 pharmacokinetic parameters among four human volunteers, and to explore possible effects of CHL or Chla cotreatment in three of those volunteers. For protocol 1, fasted subjects received an Institutional Review Boardâ€“approved dose of 14C-AFB1 (30 ng, 5 nCi) by capsule with 100 mL water, followed by normal eating and drinking after 2 hours. Blood and cumulative urine samples were collected over 72 hours, and 14C- AFB1 equivalents were determined by accelerator mass spectrometry.
