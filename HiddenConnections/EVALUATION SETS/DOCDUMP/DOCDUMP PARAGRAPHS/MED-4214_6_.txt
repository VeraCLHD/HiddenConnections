Relative risks associated with a greater FFA level were lowest among those of normal weight and highest among the obese, but a formal test of interaction between FFAs and BMI was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with higher fasting levels of plasma FFAs were at modestly higher risk of type 2 diabetes in this cohort of middle-aged adults.
