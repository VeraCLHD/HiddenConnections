Progression in percent stenosis tended to be less in women with higher intake of cereal fiber (P = .10) or whole-grain foods (P = .09), after similar adjustments. Intakes of total, fruit, and vegetable fiber, and number of servings of refined grain, fruits, or vegetable were not associated with progression. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intakes of cereal fiber and whole-grain products are associated with less progression of coronary atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women with established CAD.
