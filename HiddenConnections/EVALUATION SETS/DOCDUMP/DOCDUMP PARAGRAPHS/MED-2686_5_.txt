RESULTS: All test foods reduced plaque pH over the 30-minute period, with the largest reduction noted between 10 to 15 minutes. Consumption of cRB produced the largest pH drop compared to the other food groups at 10 minutes (P < .001). Addition of raisins to bran flakes (eRB) promoted a less pronounced pH drop beyond 10 minutes when compared to bran flakes alone (P < .001).
