The basic diet (B) contained 50 g protein/d; diets P and M (also basic diets) were enriched with either 32 g protein/d (P) or 10 mmol L-methionine/d (M). Methionine was given (as a specific nonprotein source of endogenously derived sulfate) to control for possible confounding effects on DHEAS due to an increased sulfate supply. At the end of each 4-day diet period, blood and 24-hour urine samples were collected.
