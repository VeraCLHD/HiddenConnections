Abstract BACKGROUND: Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a retrovirus, usually causes a subclinical infection of dairy and beef cattle, but in < 1% of infected cattle a B cell lymphoma may develop after several years of infection. BLV is transmitted horizontally among cattle, and infected animals have anti-BLV titers. Expression of BLV antigen, however, is silent in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo.
