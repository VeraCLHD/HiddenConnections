Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal. Few significant differences were found among any of the steps. SBP and DBP differed significantly between groups during two of the noninvasive steps; and tcpO2 differed significantly during six steps.
