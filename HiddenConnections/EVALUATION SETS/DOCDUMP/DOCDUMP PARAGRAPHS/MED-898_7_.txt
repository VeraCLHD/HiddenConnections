Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of autologous sera on GD thyrocytes were greatly reduced after specific depletion of anti-Gal from these sera. No binding and no stimulatory effects of anti-Gal were observed, however, with normal human thyrocytes and with thyrocytes from thyrotoxic patients who lack thyroid-stimulating Igs or thyrotropin binding inhibiting Igs. These in vitro stimulatory effects of anti-Gal on GD thyrocytes suggest that this natural Ab may contribute to the in vivo continuous stimulation of thyrocytes in GD patients.
