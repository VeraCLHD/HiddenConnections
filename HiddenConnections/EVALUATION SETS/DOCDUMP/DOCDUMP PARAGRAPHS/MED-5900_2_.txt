Little is known about the effect of brief exercise, more reflective of naturally occurring patterns of physical activity in children, on immune cell responses. Objectives To determine whether (1) a 6‐min bout of exercise can increase circulating inflammatory cells in healthy children and (2) the effect of brief exercise is greater in children with a history of asthma. Methods Children with mild–moderate persistent asthma and age‐matched controls (n = 14 in each group, mean age 13.6 years) performed a 6‐min bout of cycle‐ergometer exercise.
