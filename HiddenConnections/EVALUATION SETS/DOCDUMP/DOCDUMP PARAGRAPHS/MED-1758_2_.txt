DESIGN: Patients (n = 33) who underwent primary knee arthroplasty had venous blood samples collected preoperatively and postoperatively (beginning 6-12 h after surgery and on each morning for 5 d) for the measurement of 25(OH) D, vitamin D-binding protein, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, C-reactive protein, and albumin. A final sample was collected at 3 mo. RESULTS: Preoperatively, most patients were 25(OH)D deficient (<50 nmol/L) and had secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH > 5 pmol/L).
