Abstract OBJECTIVE: To study hair mercury concentrations among women of reproductive age in relation to fish intake in Ontario, Canada. STUDY DESIGN: Three groups were studied: 22 women who had called the Motherisk Program for information on the reproductive safety of consuming fish during pregnancy, a group of Japanese residing in Toronto (n=23) consuming much larger amounts of fish, and a group of Canadian women of reproductive age (n=20) not seeking advice, were studied. Mercury concentrations in hair samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
