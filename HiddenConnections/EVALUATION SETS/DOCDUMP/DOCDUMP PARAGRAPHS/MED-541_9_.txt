However, a greater intake of saturated fat at 6 months was associated with higher weight at 18 months (P = 0.002). A greater intake of plant protein at 6 month was marginally associated with lower absolute weight at 18 month (P = 0.069). We conclude that macronutrient intakes before the intervention were not associated with subsequent body weight at 6 or 18 months.
