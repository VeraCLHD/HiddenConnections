We screened NARMS isolates for the presence of blaCMY, determined whether the gene was plasmid-encoded, examined pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns to assess the genetic diversities of the isolates, and categorized the blaCMY plasmids by plasmid incompatibility groups and plasmid multi-locus sequence typing. All 47 blaCMY genes were found to be plasmid encoded. Incompatibility/replicon typing demonstrated that 41 were IncI1 plasmids, 40 of which only conferred blaCMY associated resistance.
