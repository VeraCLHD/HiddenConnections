We performed a structured literature review using PubMed and Medline searches with secondary review of cited publications, identifying studies on the role of curcumin in conquering drug resistance in cancer. This review describes how curcumin sensitizes cancer cells through regulation of multiple multidrug resistance pathways, thus employing one drug for multiple targets. Curcumin helps the cancer cells to regain their 'forgotten' apoptosis, modulates drug-target interaction at different levels, restrains survival pathways when their proteins are overexpressed, and finds an alternate way to carry forward the process of sensitization of different resistant tumours.
