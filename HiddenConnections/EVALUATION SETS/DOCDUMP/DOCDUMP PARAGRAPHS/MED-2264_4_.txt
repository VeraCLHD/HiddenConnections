Further adjustment for adiposity attenuated the association of ASB, HR 1.06 (0.93, 1.20). There was a positive doseâ€“response relationship with total sweet beverages: HR per 5% energy 1.18 (1.11, 1.26). Substituting ASB for any SSB did not reduce the incidence in analyses accounting for energy intake and adiposity.
