Preventing these illnesses is challenging because resources are limited and linking individual illnesses to a particular food is rarely possible except during an outbreak. We developed a method of attributing illnesses to food commodities that uses data from outbreaks associated with both simple and complex foods. Using data from outbreak-associated illnesses for 1998â€“2008, we estimated annual US foodborne illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths attributable to each of 17 food commodities.
