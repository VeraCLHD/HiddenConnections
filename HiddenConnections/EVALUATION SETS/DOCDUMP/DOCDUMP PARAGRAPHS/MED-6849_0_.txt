Abstract Co-stimulatory signals through the CD28 receptor enhance the survival of T cells that have their antigen receptor (TCR) engaged. Here we show that stimulation through the CD28 receptor in the absence of TCR engagement with either an anti-CD28 cross-linking antibody or the CD80 ligand transiently increases expression of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) on T cells. Antibodies that block signaling through the IGF-IR decrease the survival of T cells activated through the TCR and CD28 in the presence of IL-2 by more than 50%, and also enhance susceptibility to Fas-induced apoptosis.
