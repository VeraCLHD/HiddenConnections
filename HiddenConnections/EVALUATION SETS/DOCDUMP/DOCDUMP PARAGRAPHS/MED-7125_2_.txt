Design: We prospectively studied 54,632 US women from the Nurses' Health Study who were 50â€“77 y of age and free from depressive symptoms at baseline. Information on diet was obtained from validated food-frequency questionnaires. Clinical depression was defined as reporting both physician-diagnosed depression and regular antidepressant medication use.
