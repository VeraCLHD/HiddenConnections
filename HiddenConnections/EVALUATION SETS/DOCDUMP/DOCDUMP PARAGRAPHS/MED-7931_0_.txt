Abstract Objective: To determine if a supplement of soy protein improves body composition, body fat distribution, and glucose and insulin metabolism in non-diabetic postmenopausal women compared to an isocaloric casein placebo. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial Setting: Clinical Research Center Patients: 15 postmenopausal women Interventions: CT scans at L4/L5, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), hyperglycemic clamps Main outcome measures: Total fat, total abdominal fat, visceral fat, subcutaneous abdominal fat, and insulin secretion. Results: Weight by DXA did not change between groups (+1.38 ± 2.02 kg for placebo vs. +0.756 ± 1.32 kg for soy, p=0.48, means ± S.D.).
