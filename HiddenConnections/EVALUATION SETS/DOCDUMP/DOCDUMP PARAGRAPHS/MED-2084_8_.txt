By directly monitoring blood pressure changes in response to salt infusion, we found that in vivo infusion of salt induced an acute increase in blood pressure in a salt concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that eNOS is sensitive to changes in salt concentration. A 5-mmol/L rise in salt concentration, within the range observed in essential hypertension patients or in individuals with high salt intake, could significantly suppress eNOS activity.
