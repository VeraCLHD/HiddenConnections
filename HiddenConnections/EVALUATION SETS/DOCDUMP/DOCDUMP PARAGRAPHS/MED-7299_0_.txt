Abstract Biogenic amines, produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids, have been associated with toxicological symptoms in food products. Twenty-three samples of traditionally available Korean fermented soybean paste samples (Doenjang) were analyzed in order to determine the content of biogenic amines. Amines were extracted with 0.4M perchloric acid and derivatized with dansyl chloride.
