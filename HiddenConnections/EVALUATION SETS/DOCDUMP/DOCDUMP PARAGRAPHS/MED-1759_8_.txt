This benefit is consistent with the effect of estrogens on lipoprotein subfractions (decreasing low-density lipoprotein levels and elevating high-density lipoprotein levels). A quantitative overview of all studies taken together yielded a relative risk of 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.50-0.61), and taking only the internally controlled prospective and angiographic studies, the relative risk was 0.50 (95% confidence interval 0.43-0.56).
