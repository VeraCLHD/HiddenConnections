In the diet protocol, 12 male subjects ingested both a high-fat and low-fat diet for 3 days each. Before and after completion of each diet, IMCL levels and insulin sensitivity were assessed. After the high-fat diet, IMCL levels increased significantly in TA muscle (to 148.0 +/- 16.9% of baseline; P = 0.005), but not in SOL muscle (to 114.4 +/- 8.2% of baseline; NS).
