The edible Solanaceae fruit analyzed in this investigation were found to contain relatively consistent amounts of nicotine in the range of 2-7 microg/kg for fresh fruits. Nevertheless, the nicotine concentrations of the investigated tomato varieties decreased significantly with increasing degree of ripening of the fruits. In addition, a variety of black as well as green teas was investigated for the nicotine content.
