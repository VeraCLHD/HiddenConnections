The prevalence of breathlessness also decreased with vegetable consumption, the adjusted odds ratio being 0.49 (95% CI 0.27-0.88) for the highest versus lowest quartile of intake. However, the effects of fruit consumption were not significant. Among the nutrients contained in vegetables and fruits, vitamin A was particularly significant (p=0.008) with an estimated 52% reduction in COPD risk at the highest level of intake.
