Fetal DHA deficiency sufficient to constrain CNS development was assessed based on increased risk that infants in the placebo group would not achieve neurodevelopment scores in the top quartile of all infants in the study. Results Infants in the placebo group were at increased risk of lower language development assessed as words understood (OR 3.22, CL 1.49–6.94, P = 0.002) and produced (OR 2.61, CL 1.22–5.58, P = 0.01) at 14 mo, and words understood (OR 2.77, CL 1.23–6.28, P = 0.03) and sentences produced (OR 2.60, CL 1.15–5.89, P = 0.02) at 18 mo using the McArthur Communicative Developmental Inventory; receptive (OR 2.23, CL 1.08–4.60, P = 0.02) and expressive language (OR 1.89, CL 0.94–3.83, P = 0.05) at 18 mo using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III; and visual acuity (OR 2.69, CL 1.10–6.54, P = 0.03) at 2 mo.
