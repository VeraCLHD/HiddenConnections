Numerous studies in recent years investigated the role of Hcy as a cause of brain damage. Hcy itself or folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause disturbed methylation and/or redox potentials, thus promoting calcium influx, amyloid and tau protein accumulation, apoptosis, and neuronal death. The Hcy effect may also be mediated by activating the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype.
