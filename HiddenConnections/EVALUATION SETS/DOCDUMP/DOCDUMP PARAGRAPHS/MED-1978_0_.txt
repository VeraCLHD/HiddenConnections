Abstract Diet may play a causative role in Parkinson's disease (PD), but potential associations between diet and PD risk rarely have been assessed in prospective studies. We investigated associations between food intakes and PD risk in two large prospective cohorts in which 210 incident PD cases in men and 184 in women were documented. A positive association was found between dairy intake and PD risk in men (relative risk [RR] comparing extreme categories, 1.8; p trend = 0.004), but not in women (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.9).
