The environmental obesogen model proposes that chemical exposure during critical stages in development can influence subsequent adipogenesis, lipid balance and obesity. Obesogens are chemicals that inappropriately stimulate adipogenesis and fat storage. Numerous obesogens have been identified in recent years and some of these have been shown to act through the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, the master regulator of adipogenesis.
