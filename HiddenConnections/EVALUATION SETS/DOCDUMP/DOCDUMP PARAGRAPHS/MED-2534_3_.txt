Among 19 compounds tested, dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) were found to have estrogenic activities, all of which were completely suppressed by the addition of pure anti-estrogen ICI 182780. DCHP stimulated cell proliferation with maximal cell yield at 5 x 10(-5) M. Its estrogenic potency was approximately 1700000 times less than that of 17beta-estradiol. DEHP and BBP stimulated cell proliferation only slightly at >10(-3) M. No other phthalate diesters or monoesters tested were estrogenic.
