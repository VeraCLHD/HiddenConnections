Both FGF-23 and its co-receptor Klotho may have direct effects on the vasculature leading to calcification. Fascinatingly, disturbances in FGF-23-Klotho and raised P have also been associated with premature aging. These data suggest that high P levels have adverse vascular effects and that maintaining the serum P levels in the normal range reduces cardiovascular risk and mortality.
