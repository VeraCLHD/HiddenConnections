We investigated associations between food intakes and PD risk in two large prospective cohorts in which 210 incident PD cases in men and 184 in women were documented. A positive association was found between dairy intake and PD risk in men (relative risk [RR] comparing extreme categories, 1.8; p trend = 0.004), but not in women (RR, 1.1; p trend = 0.9). No other food groups were associated with PD risk in either men or women.
