Anthocyanins are natural colorants belonging to the flavonoid family, and are wildly used for their antioxidant properties. Here, we provided molecular evidence associated with the anti-metastatic effects of peonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside, major anthocyanins extracted from black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica), by showing a marked inhibition on the invasion and motility of SKHep-1 cells. This effect was associated with a reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA).
