AD patients have defects in phagocytosis of amyloid-beta (1-42) (Abeta) in vitro by the innate immune cells, monocyte/macrophages and in clearance of Abeta plaques [5]. The natural product curcuminoids enhanced brain clearance of Abeta in animal models. We, therefore, treated macrophages of six AD patients and 3 controls by curcuminoids in vitro and measured Abeta uptake using fluorescence and confocal microscopy.
