Abstract Background: Organically produced foods are less likely than conventionally produced foods to contain pesticide residues. Methods: We examined the hypothesis that eating organic food may reduce the risk of soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other common cancers in a large prospective study of 623â€‰080 middle-aged UK women. Women reported their consumption of organic food and were followed for cancer incidence over the next 9.3 years.
