The incidence of melanoma in our population was 12 per 11 942.2 transplant years, which is approximately 8 times greater than the standardized rate for this region. We found that the mean interval between transplant and melanoma was approximately 11 years (median 8.5). A dermatologist was the diagnosing clinician in at least 67% of cases.
