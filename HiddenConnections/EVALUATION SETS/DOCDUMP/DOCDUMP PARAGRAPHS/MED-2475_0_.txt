Abstract BACKGROUND: There are very limited data regarding the effects of blueberry flavonoid intake on vascular function in healthy humans. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the impact of blueberry flavonoid intake on endothelial function in healthy men and assessed potential mechanisms of action by the assessment of circulating metabolites and neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity. DESIGN: Two randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover human-intervention trials were conducted with 21 healthy men.
