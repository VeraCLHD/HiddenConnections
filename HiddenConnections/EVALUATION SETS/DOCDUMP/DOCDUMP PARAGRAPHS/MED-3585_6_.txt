Participants with less frequent bowel movements (BM: <7/wk) had reduced odds of diverticulosis compared to those with regular (7/wk) BM (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40–0.80). Those reporting hard stools also had a reduced odds (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55–1.02). There was no association between diverticulosis and straining (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.59–1.22) or incomplete BM (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.61–1.20).
