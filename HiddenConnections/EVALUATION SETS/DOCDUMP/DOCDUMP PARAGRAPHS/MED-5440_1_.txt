With regard to lipid peroxidation, one of the most important questions concerns the source of the primary catalysts that initiate peroxidation in situ in muscle foods. When cells are injured, such as in muscle foods after slaughtering, lipid peroxidation is favored, and traces of O(2) and H(2)O(2), indicating lipid peroxides, are formed. The stability of a muscle food product will depend on the 'tone' of these peroxides and especially from the involvement of metal ions in the process.
