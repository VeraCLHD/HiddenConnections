Respondents of higher socioeconomic status (income, education) and younger age were more likely to believe their physician receives gifts. In multivariate analyses, those that believe their personal physician receives gifts were more likely to report low physician trust (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.56–3.30) and high health care system distrust (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.49–2.77). Similarly, those that believe almost all doctors accept gifts were more likely to report low physician trust (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.25–2.29) and high health care system distrust (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.82–3.62).
