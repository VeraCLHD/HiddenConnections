BLV is transmitted horizontally among cattle, and infected animals have anti-BLV titers. Expression of BLV antigen, however, is silent in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo. The tropism of BLV has been assumed to be limited to B lymphocytes, because no other cell type has been found to harbor the virus in vivo.
