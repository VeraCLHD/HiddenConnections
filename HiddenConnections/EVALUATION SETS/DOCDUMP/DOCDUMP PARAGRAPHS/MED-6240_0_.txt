Abstract Functional gastrointestinal disorders are associated with low health-related quality of life and high resource utilization. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder defined as the acute onset of new IBS symptoms in an individual who has not previously met the Rome criteria for IBS, immediately after an acute illness characterized by 2 or more of the following: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or a positive bacterial stool culture. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in PI-IBS are currently unknown, it is believed that a transitory inflammation leads to subtle but permanent changes in the structure and function of the digestive system that induce symptoms.
