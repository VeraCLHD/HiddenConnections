The primary analysis included 1,054 individuals with clinical information and semiquantitative neuropathologic measurements: 921 had AD as the primary neuropathologic diagnosis and 133 were considered neuropathologically normal. RESULTS: Overall, 9% of the individuals had clinical history of stroke during life, but 33% had evidence of cerebral infarcts at postmortem. There was no association between neuritic plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, the primary neuropathologic manifestations of AD, with either clinical history of stroke or the presence of cerebral infarcts at postmortem.
