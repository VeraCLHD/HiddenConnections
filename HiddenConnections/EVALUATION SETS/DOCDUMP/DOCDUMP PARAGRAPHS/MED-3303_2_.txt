A G(2)P(0)Ab(1) woman had an uncomplicated first and second trimester and normal 20-week fetal ultrasound. At 37 weeks, she developed polyhydramnios; a fetal echocardiogram showed right atrial and ventricular (RV) enlargement with RV dysfunction. Immediately after birth, there was pulmonary hypertension by echocardiogram with DA closure, severe RV hypertrophy and dysfunction, and marked right-to-left atrial shunting.
