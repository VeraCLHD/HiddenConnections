The median time interval between manifestation of ED and CV death was 10.0 years. A greater proportion of deaths from oncological than from CV causes (25.0% vs. 10.8%) occurred within the first 5 years of the manifestation of ED. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of CV mortality is greater in men with ED, almost as many men die of oncological as of CV causes, with a higher proportion of oncological deaths occurring sooner subsequent to the first manifestation of ED.
