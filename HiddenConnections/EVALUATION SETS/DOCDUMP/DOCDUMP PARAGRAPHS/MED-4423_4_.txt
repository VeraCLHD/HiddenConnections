We defined a low-risk lifestyle as not smoking, a body mass index <25 kg/m 2, ≥30 minutes/day of moderate activity, consuming alcohol modestly (men:5–30g; women:5–15g alcohol/day), and scoring within the top 40% of a healthy diet score. We documented 1559 strokes (853 ischemic, 278 hemorrhagic) among women and 994 strokes (600 ischemic, 161 hemorrhagic) among men during follow-up. Women with all five low-risk factors had a relative risk of 0.21 (95%CI:0.12, 0.36) for total and 0.19 (95%CI:0.09, 0.40) for ischemic stroke, compared to women who had none of these factors.
