Results Hispanic subgroups did not differ in their intake of total FVC (mean cups = 3.4 and 2.9 for men and women, respectively). Small but significant differences (p<0.01) were found across Hispanic subgroups in individual FVC components (green salad (women only), cooked dried beans and non-fried white potatoes) after adjusting for potential sociodemographic and acculturation confounders. Conclusion Hispanic FVC intake did not meet the national recommendation, although their reported intake is higher compared to other race/ethnicity groups.
