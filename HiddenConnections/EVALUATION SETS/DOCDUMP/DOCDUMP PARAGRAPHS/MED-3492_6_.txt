In the CBF curve, the time velocity integral of diastolic flow (Dtvi) and the product of Dtvi and heart rate (HR) were measured. In six patients, these measurements were repeated after successful coronary intervention. RESULTS: In the healthy volunteer controls, Dtvi and Dtvi x HR increased after food intake with a peak value at 15 min, which indicates the presence of postprandial surge in the CBF.
