Abstract Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels are elevated in obesity. FFA, by causing insulin resistance in muscle, liver, and endothelial cells, contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mechanism through which FFA induces insulin resistance involves intramyocellular and intrahepatocellular accumulation of triglycerides and diacylglycerol, activation of several serine/threonine kinases, reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2, and impairment of the IRS/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway of insulin signaling.
