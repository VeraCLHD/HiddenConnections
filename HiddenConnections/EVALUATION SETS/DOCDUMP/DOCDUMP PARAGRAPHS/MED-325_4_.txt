Over 9 (mean) years of follow-up we identified 1816 incident cases of RCC. HRs and 95% CIs were estimated within quintiles by using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Total dietary fiber intake was associated with a significant 15â€“20% lower risk of RCC in the 2 highest quintiles compared with the lowest (P-trend = 0.005).
