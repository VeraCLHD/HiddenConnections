An escalating dose (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg per day) of bikunin was administered orally to nine patients for 7 days. There were no dose-limiting toxicities and the MTD of the bikunin schedule was not defined. The authors also obtained preliminary data on its effect on urokinase-type plasminogen activator expression at the highest dose level.
