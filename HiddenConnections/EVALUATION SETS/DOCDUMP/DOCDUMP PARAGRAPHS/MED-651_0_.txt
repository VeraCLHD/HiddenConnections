Abstract Eight adult female patients suffering from abdominal pain and chronic diarrhea which was often incapacitating and frequently nocturnal, had dramatic relief on a gluten-free diet and return of symptoms after gluten challenge. Previous nonspecific measures and a milk-free diet were ineffective. Multiple jejunal biopsies showed minor, but significant changes in cellularity which returned to normal on the gluten-free diet.
