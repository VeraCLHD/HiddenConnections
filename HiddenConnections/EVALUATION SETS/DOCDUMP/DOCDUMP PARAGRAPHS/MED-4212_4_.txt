The role of hyperinsulinemia is relatively under documented in the literature for the initiation of insulin resistance. In this review, an interaction of fatty acid and beta-cells, and a synergy between free fatty acids (FFAs) and insulin are emphasized for the role of hyperinsulinemia. This article presents the evidence about FFA-induced insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo, recent advances in the molecular mechanism of FFA action in beta-cells, a role of GPR40 in the development of insulin resistance, and the negative feedback loop of the insulin receptor signal pathway.
