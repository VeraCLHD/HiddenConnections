Abstract Purpose A neutropenic diet is often used to prevent infection in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although such a diet potentially entails inconvenience, its value is uncertain. Patients and Methods One hundred fifty-three patients admitted to a high-efficiency particulate airâ€“filtered room (protected environment [PE]) to receive induction therapy for newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned to a diet containing no raw fruits or vegetables (cooked diet) or to a diet containing fresh fruit and fresh vegetables (raw diet).
