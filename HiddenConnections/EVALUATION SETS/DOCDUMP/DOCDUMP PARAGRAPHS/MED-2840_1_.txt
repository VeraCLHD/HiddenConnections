We measured the in vitro production of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-1 beta by peripheral mononuclear cells from selected healthy young (mean age 26.8 years) and aged (mean age 80.2 years) subjects. Significant increases of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels were found in mitogen-stimulated cultures from aged donors, occurring at 24 to 72 h after stimulation. No significant differences were observed for IFN-gamma production.
