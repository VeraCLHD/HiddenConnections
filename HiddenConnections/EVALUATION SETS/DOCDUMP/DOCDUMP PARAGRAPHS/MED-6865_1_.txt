The risk factors for pig herd contamination have yet to be determined. The objective of this study was to validate a sensitive method for the detection of Y. enterocolitica and to describe the distribution of the bacteria in pigs at slaughter from conventional and alternative ("organic") housing systems. First, samples were collected from tonsils, caecum with caecal contents, and the caecal lymph nodes of 60 slaughter pigs.
