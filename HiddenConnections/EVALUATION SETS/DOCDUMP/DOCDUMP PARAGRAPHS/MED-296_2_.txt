Methods and Results After exclusions for missing data and prevalent cancer, 13,253 ARIC participants were included for analysis. Baseline measurements were used to classify participants according to seven AHA cardiovascular health metrics. Combined cancer incidence (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) from 1987-2006 was captured using cancer registries and hospital surveillance; 2880 incident cancer cases occurred over follow-up.
