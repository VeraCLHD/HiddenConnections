Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) are independently associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A case-cohort design was used to randomly select 580 incident cases of diabetes and 566 noncases from 10,275 African-American and white men and women in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, aged 45-64 years and without prevalent diabetes at the baseline exam. Incident diabetes was ascertained at three exams over 9 years of follow-up.
