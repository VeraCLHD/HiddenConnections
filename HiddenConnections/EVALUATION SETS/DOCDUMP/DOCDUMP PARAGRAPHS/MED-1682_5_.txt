Mixed-effects regression models accounting for repeated measures and left-censoring limits were applied. Results Mean E2 and E1S were lower during the high-soy than the low-soy diet (113 vs. 313 pg/mL and 46 vs. 68 ng/mL, respectively) without reaching significance (p=0.07); the interaction between group and diet and was not significant. There was no effect of the soy treatment on serum E2 (p=0.76), E1 (p=0.86), or E1S (p=0.56).
