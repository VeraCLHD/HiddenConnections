Dietary sulfur-containing amino acids have been reported to improve the mineral status of experimental animals. Our objective was to examine whether sulfur compound-rich Allium spices have a similar potential of beneficially modulating the mineral bioavailability. In this context, we examined the influence of exogenously added garlic and onion on the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc from food grains.
