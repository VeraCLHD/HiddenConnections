Central laboratories evaluated atherosclerosis in the aorta and coronary arteries, measured lipoproteins and thio-cyanate (for smoking) in serum, glycohemo-globin in red blood cells (for blood glucose), thickness of small renal arteries (for hypertension), and body mass index (for obesity). The data were analyzed to determine the progression of atherosclerosis with age in both sexes and the association of the risk factors with atherosclerotic lesions. RESULTS: Raised lesions of the coronary arteries, the advanced lesions of atherosclerosis that lead directly to CHD, are associated positively with non-HDL cholesterol concentration, hypertension, obesity (in men), and blood glucose concentration; and inversely, with HDL cholesterol concentration.
