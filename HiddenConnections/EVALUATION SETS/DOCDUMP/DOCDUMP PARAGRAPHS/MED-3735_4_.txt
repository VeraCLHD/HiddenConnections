Baseline and follow-up levels of PRA were available in 381 participants. Compared with the control diet, the DASH diet increased PRA by 0.37 ng ml(-1) h(-1) (P=0.01). In multivariable linear regression analyses, there was an inverse association of PRA change with systolic BP change on the control diet (slope=-0.35, P=0.001), but PRA did not differ by BP change on the F/V diet (slope=-0.002, P=0.98) or DASH diet (slope=-0.08, P=0.32).
