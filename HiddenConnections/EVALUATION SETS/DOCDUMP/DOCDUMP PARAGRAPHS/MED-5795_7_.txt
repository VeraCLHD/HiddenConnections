In contrast, BOLD signal decreased in the cortical control areas during fructose infusion (p = 0.006), corresponding with increases of plasma fructose and lactate. Neither glucose nor fructose infusions significantly altered BOLD signal in the hypothalamus. CONCLUSION: In normal weight humans, cortical responses as assessed by BOLD fMRI to infused glucose are opposite to those of fructose.
