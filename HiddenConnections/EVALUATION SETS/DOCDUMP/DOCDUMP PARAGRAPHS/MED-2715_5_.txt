Case-control and autopsy studies showed elevated Fe levels in the brains of AD patients, whereas the evidence was less consistent for Cu. In most of the studies, Cu concentrations were unchanged in the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain but increased in the serum. In conclusion, the existing data suggest that diets excessive in Fe or Cu, together with a high intake of SFA, should be avoided in the elderly who are not at risk of anaemia.
