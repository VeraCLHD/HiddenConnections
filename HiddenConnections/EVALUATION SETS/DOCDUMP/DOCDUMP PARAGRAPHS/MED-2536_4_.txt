RESULTS: The general public and those with allergy are exposed to significant levels of phthalates via diet, pharmaceuticals, phthalate-containing products, and ambient indoor environment via air and dust. Intravenous exposures occur through medical equipment. Phthalates are metabolized and excreted quickly in the body with metabolites measured in urine.
