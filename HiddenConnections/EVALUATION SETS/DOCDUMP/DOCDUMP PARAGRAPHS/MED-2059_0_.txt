Abstract Equol [7-hydroxy-3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-chroman] is a nonsteroidal estrogen of the isoflavone class. It is exclusively a product of intestinal bacterial metabolism of dietary isoflavones and it possesses estrogenic activity, having affinity for both estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. Equol is superior to all other isoflavones in its antioxidant activity.
