Abstract BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that vascular risk factors (VRF) contribute to cognitive decline. Whether their treatment can slow down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
