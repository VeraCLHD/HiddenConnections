RESULTS: Forty constipated subjects (m/f=3/37, mean age=38 years) participated. The number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week (primary outcome measure) and stool consistency scores improved significantly (P<0.05) with dried plums when compared to psyllium. Straining and global constipation symptoms did not differ significantly between treatments (P=N.S.).
