Berries contain many known chemopreventive agents, such as anthocyanins and ellagitannins, that can be greatly concentrated in freeze-dried berry powders. Based on our program of berry research, this commentary presents the first reported stepwise scheme for the preclinical and clinical development of foodstuffs for cancer prevention. Our preclinical work within this scheme includes promising approaches for assessing the chemopreventive potential of berry powder and berry extracts in preclinical model systems; for determining these compoundsâ€™ mechanisms of action; and for identifying the active constituents in berries.
