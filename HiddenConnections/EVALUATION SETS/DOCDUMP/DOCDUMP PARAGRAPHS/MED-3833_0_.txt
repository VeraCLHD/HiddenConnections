Abstract Identification of modifiable risk factors is an attractive approach to primary prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJAC). We conducted a review of the literature to investigate the association between specific dietary components and the risk of Barrettâ€™s esophagus (BE), EAC and EGJAC, supposing diet might be a risk factor for these tumors. Consumption of meat and high-fat meals has been found positively associated with EAC and EGJAC.
