When applied to cultured porcine lenses, SFN protected against H2O2-induced opacification. Illumina whole-genome HT-12 v4 beadchip microarray data revealed eight genes upregulated following 24-hour exposure to 1- and 2-Î¼M SFN, which included NQO1 and TXNRD1. This pattern was confirmed at the protein level.
