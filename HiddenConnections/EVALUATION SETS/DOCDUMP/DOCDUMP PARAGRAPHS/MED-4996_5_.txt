In addition to the unique profile of genetic alterations, colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability have distinct pathologic features and improved survival. Finally, cancers from most patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (or Lynch syndrome) have microsatellite instability due to germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes. Identification of the microsatellite instability pathway has enormous implications for the clinical investigation and management of colorectal cancer patients.
