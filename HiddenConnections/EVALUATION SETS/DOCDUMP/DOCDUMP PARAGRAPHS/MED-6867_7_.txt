In all years, the most common bioserotype was 4, O:3, followed by bioserotype 2, O:5,27. Kappa between herd-level status based on pig and pooled samples ranged between 0.51 and 0.68 for biotype 1A and bioserotype 4, O:3, respectively. For 4, O:3, a significant bias in discordant pairs was detected, indicating that pig samples were more sensitive than pooled samples in declaring a herd as positive.
