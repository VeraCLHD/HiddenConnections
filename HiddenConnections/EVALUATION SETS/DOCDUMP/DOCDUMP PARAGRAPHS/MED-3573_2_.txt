This investigation evaluated the validity and efficacy of 2 novel techniques (i.e., thirst sensation and urine volume) to assess hydration state of 29 active men (mean ± SD; age, 23 ± 4 years; body mass, 76.02 ± 11.94 kg) at rest. Eight combinations of 4 water challenges (4.8, 9.3, 11.0, or 14 mL·kg(-1)) and 2 hydration states (mildly hypohydrated (HY), -2.0%; euhydrated (EU), -0.2% body mass) were employed. First, thirst was linearly related to body water loss, and ratings of thirst distinguished HY from EU (p < 0.001) subsequent to 19 h of controlled food and fluid intake.
