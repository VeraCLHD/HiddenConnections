A survey of 1000 children was performed after 3 y. Significant differences in hemoglobin concentrations were found in the children from the fortified vs the nonfortified province (P < 0.01). Low serum ferritin values were also significantly more prevalent in the nonfortified group. The effect was evident despite the very low prevalence of anemia in both the fortified and the unfortified school groups.
