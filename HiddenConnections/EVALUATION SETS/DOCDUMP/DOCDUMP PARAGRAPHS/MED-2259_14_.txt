Erectile dysfunction (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.07-3.10) and a high body mass index (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.19) increased the risk of PS after RP. Nerve-sparing (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.16-0.95) reduced the risk of PS. CONCLUSIONS: Orgasm-associated problems, UI during sexual activity, penile sensory changes, PS, and penile deformity are common side effects to RP.
