Abstract To investigate the association between idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD) and reduced frequency of prior cigarette smoking, the authors compared the 29-year follow-up mortality rates and IPD incidence rates of men who were either cigarette smokers or nonsmokers at the time of enrollment in the Honolulu Heart Study (1965-1968). Based on IPD cases detected up to June 30, 1994, the age-adjusted incidence rate in smokers was less than half that in nonsmokers: 34.4 versus 94.2 cases per 100,000 person-years of pre-illness follow-up, respectively. When data were stratified by 5-year age group, lower IPD incidence in smokers was observed at all ages between 50 and 90 years.
