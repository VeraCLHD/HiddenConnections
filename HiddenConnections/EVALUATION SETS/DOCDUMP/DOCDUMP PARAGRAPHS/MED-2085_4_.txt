On the last day of each diet, subjects were instrumented with two microdialysis fibres for the local delivery of Ringer solution and 20 mm ascorbic acid (AA). Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure red blood cell flux during local heating-induced vasodilatation (42Â°C). After the established plateau, 10 mm l-NAME was perfused to quantify NO-dependent vasodilatation.
