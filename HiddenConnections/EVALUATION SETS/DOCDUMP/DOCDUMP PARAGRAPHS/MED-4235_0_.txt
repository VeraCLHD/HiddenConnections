Abstract BACKGROUND: The benefits of reducing blood pressure are well established, but there remains uncertainty about whether the magnitude of the effect varies with the initial blood pressure level. The objective was to compare the risk reductions achieved by different blood pressure-lowering regimens among individuals with different baseline blood pressures. METHODS: Thirty-two randomized controlled trials were included and seven comparisons between different types of treatments were made.
