Higher abnormality rates for remote memory (p=0.036), mental manipulation (p=0.013), and orientation (p=0.005) were found in the H-MeHg group than in the L-MeHg group. Long-term consumption of MeHg-contaminated fish and seafood by residents living near this contaminated area may have persistent effects on their cognitive function. We suggest a follow-up study to monitor the long-term health effects on the residents living near this deserted plant.
