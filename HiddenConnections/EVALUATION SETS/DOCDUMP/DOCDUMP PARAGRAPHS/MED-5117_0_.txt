Abstract BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) with procoagulant activity are present in human atherosclerosis, but no detailed information is available on their composition. METHODS AND RESULTS: To obtain insights into the role of MPs in atherogenesis, MP proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry, metabolite profiles were determined by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and antibody reactivity was assessed against combinatorial antigen libraries. Plaque MPs expressed surface antigens consistent with their leukocyte origin, including major histocompatibility complex classes I and II, and induced a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on T-cell proliferation.
