We conclude that processed cycad flour as prepared by the Chamorros of Guam and Rota contains extremely low levels of BMAA, which are in the order of only 0.005% by weight (mean values for all samples). Thus, even when cycad flour is a dietary staple and eaten regularly, it seems unlikely that these low levels could cause the delayed and widespread neurofibrillary degeneration of nerve cells observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam (ALS-PD).
