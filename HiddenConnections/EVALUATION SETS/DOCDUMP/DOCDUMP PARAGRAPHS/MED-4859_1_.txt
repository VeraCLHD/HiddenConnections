However, supportive treatment (oxygen and positive airway pressure) can damage the lung, and newborn respiratory failure remains a major cause of morbidity and death in infants. Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides life support while allowing the lung to "rest." We have used ECMO in 45 moribund newborn infants; 25 survived.
