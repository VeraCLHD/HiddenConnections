Abstract AIM OF THE STUDY: The potential renal acid load of foods (PRAL) has been proposed as a causative factor of renal stone format ion in patients with calcium stones. Evaluation of the dietary PRAL seems to be advisable to evaluate the lithogenic potential of the diet of the individual patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On the basis of a dietary questionnaire administered to a sample of 75 renal stone formers living in the urban area of Milan (Northern Italy), we selected the most frequently reported foods for each of 11 categories: grains, meats, cured meats, eggs, cheeses, legumes, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and juices, milk and dairies and bread.
