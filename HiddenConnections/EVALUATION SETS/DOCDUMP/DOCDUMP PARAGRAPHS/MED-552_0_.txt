Abstract Background Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measures the number and size of lipoprotein particles, instead of their cholesterol or triglyceride content, but its clinical utility is uncertain. Methods and Results Baseline lipoproteins were measured by NMR in 27,673 initially healthy women followed for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD, N=1,015) over 11 years. Adjusting for non-lipid risk factors, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for top vs bottom quintile of NMR-measured lipoprotein particle concentration (particles/L) were, for low-density lipoprotein (LDLNMR) 2.51 (1.91−3.30), high-density lipoprotein (HDLNMR) 0.91 (0.75−1.12), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDLNMR) 1.71 (1.38−2.12), and LDLNMR/HDLNMR ratio 2.25 (1.80−2.81).
