We standardized scores to facilitate comparison between studies and to enable us to complete a meta-analysis of randomized trials. In addition, we stratified our analyses according to the folate status of the country of origin. B-vitamin supplementation did not show an improvement in cognitive function for individuals with (SMD = 0.10, 95%CI -0.08 to 0.28) or without (SMD = -0.03, 95%CI -0.1 to 0.04) significant cognitive impairment.
