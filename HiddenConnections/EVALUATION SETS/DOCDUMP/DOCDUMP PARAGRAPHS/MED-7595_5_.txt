We classified the muscles as injured if 2% or more of the muscle fibres in a biopsy sample showed damage. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated the expression levels of candidate genes potentially related to myocyte injury. Results Muscle injury was observed in 25 (of 44) patients with myopathy and in 1 patient without myopathy.
