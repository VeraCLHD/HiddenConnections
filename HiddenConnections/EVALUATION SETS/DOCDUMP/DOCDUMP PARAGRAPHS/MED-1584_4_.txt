Ready-to-use mouthwashes and mouthrinses (n = 13) were rinsed in the mouth by healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (n = 4) as intended by the manufacturers (20 ml for 30 sec). Saliva was collected at 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 min after mouthwash use and analyzed using headspace gas chromatography. The acetaldehyde content in the saliva was 41 +/- 15 microM, range 9-85 microM (0.5 min), 52 +/- 14 microM, range 11-105 microM (2 min), 32 +/- 7 microM, range 9-67 microM (5 min) and 15 +/- 7 microM, range 0-37 microM (10 min).
