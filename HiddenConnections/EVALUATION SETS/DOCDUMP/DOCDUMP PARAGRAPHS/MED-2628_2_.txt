DESIGN: A parallel-design, randomized, double-blind study compared daily doses of 0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs (EPA:DHA ratio of 1.51:1) with placebo (refined olive oil). The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, arterial stiffness, and blood pressure. Nonsmoking men (n = 142) and women (n = 225) aged 45-70 y were randomly assigned to treatment for 12 mo; 312 subjects completed the intervention.
