Creatinine clearance changed from 104.4 +/- 28.7 to 89.3 +/- 16.7 ml/min (n.s.) and no correlation was found with the changes in urinary protein excretion. This data suggest that VSD reduces proteinuria and exerts favourable effects on hypercholesterolaemia. Protein malnutrition was absent in these patients, probably because of the essential amino acids and ketoanalogues supplementation.
