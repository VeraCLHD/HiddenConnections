Abstract Albert Einstein once said that "The true value of a human being can be found in the degree to which he has attained liberation from the self". For years our traditional view of 'self' was restricted to our own bodies; composed of eukaryote cells encoded by our genome. However, in the era of omics technologies and systems biology, this view now extends beyond the traditional limitations of our own core being to include our resident microbial communities.
