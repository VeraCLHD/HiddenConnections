Recent understanding of the mechanisms behind migraine pain generation and perception have considerably helped the development of modern migraine drugs. Most migraine drugs in use, i.e., ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, iprazochrome, pizotifen and diazepam; and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (i.e. aspirin, paracetamol, persantin, etc.) have side-effects and are prescribed with caution for a limited duration. Ginger is reported in Ayurvedic and Tibb systems of medicine to be useful in neurological disorders.
