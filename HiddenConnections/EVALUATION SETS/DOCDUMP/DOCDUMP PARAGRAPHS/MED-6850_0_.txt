Abstract Clonal deletion is arguably the most important mechanism of eliminating self-reactive thymocytes from the T-cell repertoire. Recent work has identified new players in this process. On the thymocyte side, several molecules have been newly implicated in the pathway from initial T-cell receptor signaling through to the final result: gene transcription and thymocyte apoptosis.
