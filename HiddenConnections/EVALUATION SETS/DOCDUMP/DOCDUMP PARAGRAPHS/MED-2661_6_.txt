RESULTS: The literature search identified 1 Phase II and 2 Phase III studies that compared belimumab (1, 4, and 10 mg/kg/dose IV on days 0, 14, and 28; then every 28 days) to placebo in patients with active SLE on concurrent therapies. Patients with active lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus were excluded. In a Phase II, 52-week study, 24-week mean Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) scores were decreased by 19.5% with belimumab versus 17.2% with placebo (P = NS).
