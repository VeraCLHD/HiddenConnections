Both date varieties possess antioxidative properties in vitro, but the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power of Hallawi versus Medjool dates was higher by 24%.

The date consumption did not significantly affect the subjects' body mass index (BMI), their serum total cholesterol, or their cholesterol levels in the VLDL, LDL, or HDL fractions.
