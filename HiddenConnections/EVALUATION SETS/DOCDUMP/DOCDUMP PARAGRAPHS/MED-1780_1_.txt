In normal subjects, the mean baseline GFR was 115.8 +/- 9.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, and the mean GFRs after ingestion of tuna fish meal were 134.1 +/- 15.5 (1 hr), 146.2 +/- 18.8 (2 hr), and 157.8 +/- 21.2 (3 hr), respectively. GFR did not significantly increase in normal subjects after ingestion of bean curd. GFR in diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria after ingestion of each protein was similar to the response in normal subjects.
