The mean correlation between T(osm) and P(osm) was r = 0.93 and that between USG and P(osm) was r = 0.72. CONCLUSIONS: T(osm) increased with dehydration and tracked alterations in P(osm) with comparable utility to USG. Measuring T(osm) using the TearLab osmolarity system may offer sports medicine practitioners, clinicians, and research investigators a practical and rapid hydration assessment technique.
