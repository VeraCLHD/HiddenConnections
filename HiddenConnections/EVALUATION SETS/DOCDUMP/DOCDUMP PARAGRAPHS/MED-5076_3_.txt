However, at the relatively low doses consumed by humans and other mammals, these same toxic plant-derived chemicals, as mild stressors, activate adaptive cellular response signaling, conferring stress resistance and other health benefits. This phenomenon has been referred to as xenohormesis. This review highlights the xenohormesis mechanisms underlying chemopreventive effects of some dietary chemopreventive phytochemicals, with special focus on the nuclear transcription factor erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a key player.
