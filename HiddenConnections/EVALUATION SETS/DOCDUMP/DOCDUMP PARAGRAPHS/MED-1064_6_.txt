Recent studies have shown differences in the composition of the microflora between healthy and allergic infants in countries with a high and low prevalence of allergies and between healthy and allergic infants within such countries. These differences are apparent within the first week of life and thus precede clinical symptoms. The use of live microorganisms that might be beneficial to health has a long tradition and the safety is well documented.
