Abstract The decline in sperm count rates over the last 50 years appears to parallel the rising prevalence of obesity. As lipids levels are strongly associated with obesity, high lipids levels or hyperlipidemia may thus play an important role in the decline in fertility in addition to other environmental or lifestyle factors. The objective of this population based cohort study was to evaluate the association between menâ€™s serum lipid concentrations and semen quality parameters among 501 male partners of couples desiring pregnancy and discontinuing contraception.
