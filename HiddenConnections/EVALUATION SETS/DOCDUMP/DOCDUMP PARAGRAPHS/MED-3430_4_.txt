Data evaluation was based on endpoints such as symptoms, Schirmer test, ocular surface staining scores, recruitment of patients, type and efficacy of the drug, and the design and site of performance of the study. Forty-nine CTs were evaluated involving 5,189 patients receiving DED treatment. Heterogeneity in study design prevented meta-analysis from yielding meaningful results, and a descriptive analysis of these studies was conducted.
