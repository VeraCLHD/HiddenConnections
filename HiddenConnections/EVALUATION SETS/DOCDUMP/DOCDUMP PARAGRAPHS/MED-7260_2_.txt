The objective of this meta-analysis was to examine the effect of soy protein supplementation on serum lipid levels in adults. English language articles were retrieved by searching MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005) and the bibliographies of the retrieved articles. A total of 41 randomized controlled trials in which isolated soy protein supplementation was the only intervention and the net changes in serum lipids during intervention were reported.
