In addition, the effect of β-glucan on total cholesterol (TC) and BGL was translated into an empirical dose-response model. METHODS: Thirty research articles that evaluated the effect of different exposure levels of β-glucan on blood cholesterol and BGL were analyzed, yielding 126 clinical studies. RESULTS: There was a significant inverse relation in TC (-0.60 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.85 to -0.34), low-density lipoprotein (-0.66 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.36), and TGL/TAG (-0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.07) after consumption of β-glucan.
