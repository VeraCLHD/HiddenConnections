Abstract Background Recent studies have raised the possibility of adverse effects of low sodium, particularly less than 2300 mg/24hr, on cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, these paradoxical findings might have resulted from suboptimal measurement of sodium and potential biases related to indication or reverse causation. Methods and Results Phases I and II of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) collected multiple 24-hour urine specimens among pre-hypertensive individuals.
