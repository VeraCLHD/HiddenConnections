Compared with respondents without ED, those with ED were more likely to be obese, smokers, physically inactive, and either divorced, widowed, or separated. Diabetes complications such as nerve damage, circulation problems, and kidney failure or kidney disease were also significantly associated with ED. After controlling for potential confounding factors, a 10% risk reduction of ED was found with each additional daily serving of fruit/vegetable consumed.
