The current goal was to re-assess a sample of our ET cases and controls to determine whether blood harmane concentration remained elevated in ET at a second time point. Blood harmane concentrations were quantified by a well-established high performance liquid chromatography method in 63 ET cases and 70 controls. A mean of approximately 6 years elapsed between the initial and this subsequent blood harmane determination.
