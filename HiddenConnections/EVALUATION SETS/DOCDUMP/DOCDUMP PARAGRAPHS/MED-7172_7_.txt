Compared with women of the control group, women with hyperlipidemia had reduced mean global FSFI score (22.8 +/- 6.8 vs. 29.4 +/- 4.9, P < 0.001). Individual analysis of the different domains showed that women with hyperlipidemia reported significantly lower arousal, orgasm, lubrication, and satisfaction scores than control women. Based on the total FSFI score, 51% of women with hyperlipidemia had scores of 26 or less, indicating sexual dysfunction, as compared with 21% of women without hyperlipidemia (P < 0.001).
