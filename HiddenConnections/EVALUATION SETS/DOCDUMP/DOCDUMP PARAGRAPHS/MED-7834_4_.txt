We reexamined this issue using more sensitive immunological techniques available today. Using immunoblotting to test the sera of 257 humans for antibodies of four isotypes (IgG1, IgM, IgA, and IgG4) to the BLV capsid antigen (p24), we detected at least one antibody isotype reactive with BLV in 74% of the human sera tested. The specificity of the reactivity was strongly suggested by competition studies and by ruling out cross-reacting antibodies to other chronic human viruses.
