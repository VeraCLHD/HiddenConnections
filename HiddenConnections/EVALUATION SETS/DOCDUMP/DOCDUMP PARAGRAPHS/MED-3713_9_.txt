On average, the effect size of Mozart music upon REE was a reduction of 7.7% from baseline. CONCLUSION: Mozart music significantly lowers REE in preterm infants, whereas Bach music has no similar effect. We speculate that 'Mozart effect' must be taken into account when incorporating music in the therapy of preterm infants, as not all types of music may have similar effects upon REE and growth.
