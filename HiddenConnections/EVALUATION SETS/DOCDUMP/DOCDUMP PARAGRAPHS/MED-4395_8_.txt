There was a linear increase in FMD according to coffee consumption ('low': 4.33 ± 2.51% vs 'moderate': 5.39 ± 3.09% vs 'high': 6.47 ± 2.72%; p = 0.032). Moreover, subjects consuming mainly a boiled Greek type of coffee had a significantly higher FMD compared with those consuming other types of coffee beverages (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic coffee consumption is associated with improved endothelial function in elderly subjects, providing a new connection between nutrition and vascular health.
