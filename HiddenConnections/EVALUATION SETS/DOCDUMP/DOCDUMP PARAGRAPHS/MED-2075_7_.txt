RESULTS: Leptin enhanced the sensitivity of MCF-7 Adr cells to zeranol and increased cell growth. Exposure to zeranol may lead to initiation of transformation of normal breast cells to breast preneoplastic cells. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that obese individuals may be at greater risk of developing zeranol-induced breast cancer.
