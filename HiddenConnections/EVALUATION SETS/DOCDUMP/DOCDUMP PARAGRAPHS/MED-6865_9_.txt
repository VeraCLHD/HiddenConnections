The highest rate of Y. enterocolitica contamination was found in tonsils (11% alternative, 22% conventional; p<0.05), followed by caecum (5%, 11%) and lymph nodes (2%, 7%). The housing system appears to be one important factor in the prevalence of this common pathogen in pig herds, as we found important differences between the two systems studied here. In the conventional system, the main risk factors appeared to be sourcing pigs from different pig suppliers, use of commercial feed and transportation to slaughter.
