Some studies of populations at high-latitude relate higher 25(OH)D to risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer or mortality. Those relationships are attributable to the dynamic fluctuations in 25(OH)D specific to high latitudes, and which can be corrected by maintaining 25(OH)D at steady, high levels throughout the year, the way they are in the tropics. (D) There are now many clinical trials that show benefits and/or no adversity with doses of vitamin D that raise serum 25(OH)D to levels beyond 75Â nmol/L.
