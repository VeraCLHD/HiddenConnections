Abstract This study measured 21 persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) pollutants in the US milk supply. Since milk fat is likely to be among the highest dietary sources of exposure to PBTs, it is important to understand their levels in this food. Nationwide samples were collected from 45 dairy plants in July of 2000 and again in January 2001.
