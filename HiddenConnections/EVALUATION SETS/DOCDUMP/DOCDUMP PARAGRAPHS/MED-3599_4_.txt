After dinner, there was a marked increase in plasma methionine by 16.7 +/- 8.9 mumol/L (87.9 +/- 49%), which was associated with a rapid and marked increase in free homocysteine (33.7 +/- 19.6%, 4 h after dinner) and a moderate and slow increase in total (13.5 +/- 7.5%, 8 h) and protein-bound (12.6 +/- 9.4%, 8 h) homocysteine. After both meals, cysteine and cysteinylglycine concentrations seemed related to changes in homocysteine, because there were parallel fluctuations in the free:bound ratios of all three thiols. Dietary changes in plasma homocysteine will probably not affect the evaluation of vitamin deficiency states associated with moderate to severe hyperhomocysteinemia but may be of concern in the risk assessment of cardiovascular disease in patients with mild hyperhomocysteinemia.
