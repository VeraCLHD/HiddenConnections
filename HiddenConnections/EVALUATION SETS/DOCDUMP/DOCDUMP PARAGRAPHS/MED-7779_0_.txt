Abstract In view of the increasing prevalence of obesity all over the world, we have seen morbid obesity occurring at earlier ages, and especially in adolescents. The first and main approach has been a conservative one, including change of lifestyle - implying better feeding habits and physical activity. However, our weapons to deal with this 'pandemic of obesity' have not solved a large number of cases, and we have to admit that bariatric surgery should be contemplated in special cases.
