Many dietary phytochemicals that are synthesized as secondary metabolites function as toxins, that is, "phytoalexins," and hence protect plants against insects and other damaging organisms and stresses. However, at the relatively low doses consumed by humans and other mammals, these same toxic plant-derived chemicals, as mild stressors, activate adaptive cellular response signaling, conferring stress resistance and other health benefits. This phenomenon has been referred to as xenohormesis.
