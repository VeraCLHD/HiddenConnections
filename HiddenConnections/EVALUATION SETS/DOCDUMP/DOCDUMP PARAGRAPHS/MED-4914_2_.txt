In vivo they may easily be formed by cyclization of indoleamines with e.g. aldehydes. For further elucidation of the role of beta-carbolines in neurodegenerative disorders harman and norharman levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured in 14 patients with PD and compared to an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 14). CSF levels of norharman and harman in PD were significantly higher compared to controls.
