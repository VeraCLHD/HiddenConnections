Deposits eventually infiltrate all cortical areas, including densely myelinated primary fields of the neocortex (stages A-C). Intraneuronal lesions develop initially in the transentorhinal region, then spread in a predictable manner across other areas (stages I-VI). At stages I-II, neurofibrillary changes develop preferentially in the absence of amyloid deposits.
