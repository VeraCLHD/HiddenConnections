The tolerability data from these studies did not suggest any overall differences between belimumab and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings from the present review, belimumab appears to be efficacious and generally well-tolerated and in the treatment of SLE other than lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus. Additional clinical and economics studies are needed to determine the most appropriate place for belimumab in the treatment of SLE.
