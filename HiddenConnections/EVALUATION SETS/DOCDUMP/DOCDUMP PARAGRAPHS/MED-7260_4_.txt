A total of 41 randomized controlled trials in which isolated soy protein supplementation was the only intervention and the net changes in serum lipids during intervention were reported. Information on study design, sample size, participant characteristics, intervention, follow-up duration, and treatment outcomes was independently abstracted using a standardized protocol. Using a random-effects model, data from each study were pooled and weighted by the inverse of their variance.
