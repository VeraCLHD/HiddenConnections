Abstract We investigated the glycemic index (GI) and the insulinemic index (II) of cake made from whole soy powder (SBC) and the suppressive effects of SBC on the postprandial blood glucose and insulin by other carbohydrate foods. Furthermore, breath hydrogen excretion was simultaneously investigated. Twenty subjects were given 114 g SBC, 144 g cooked paddy-rice, and 60 g SBC with 144 g cooked paddy-rice in random order using a within-subject, repeated-measures design.
