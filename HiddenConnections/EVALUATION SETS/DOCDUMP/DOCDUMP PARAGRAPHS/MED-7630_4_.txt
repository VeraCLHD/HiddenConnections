The total phenolic concentrations determined by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of methanolic extracts of skins of the apple genotypes varied from 150 to 700 mg/100 g DW. The antioxidant capacity measured by Folin-Ciocalteu (16.2 to 34.1 mg GAE/100 g DW), ferric reducing antioxidant power (1.3 to 3.3 g TE/100 g DW), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (5.2 to 14.2 g TE/100 g DW), and percent inhibition of oxidation of methyl linolenate (73.8% to 97.2%) varied among the apple genotypes. The apple skin extracts, specifically the crab apple varieties such as "Dolgo," were revealed to be effective inhibitors of oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid in a model system and thus can be considered as a potential source of natural food antioxidants.
