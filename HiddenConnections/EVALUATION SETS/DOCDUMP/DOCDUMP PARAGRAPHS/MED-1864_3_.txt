Stale maize porridge (high-resistant starch [HRS]) seems to induce greater fermentation in the large bowel than fresh maize porridge (low-resistant starch [LRS]). RESULTS: In the present study, healthy colostomy subjects fed stale maize porridge had significantly more production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (mean SCFA, HRS = 182.6; mean SCFA, LRS = 116.1; p < 0.05) in their colostomy effluent together with a significant drop in stool pH (mean pH, HRS = 5.91; mean pH, LRS = 6.70; p < 0.001). The SCFA butyrate (mean, HRS = 35.1; mean, LRS = 17.6; p < 0.05) and acetate (mean, HRS = 93.9; mean, LRS = 65.8; p < 0.05) were significantly elevated on the stale maize porridge diet when compared with consumption of fresh maize porridge.
