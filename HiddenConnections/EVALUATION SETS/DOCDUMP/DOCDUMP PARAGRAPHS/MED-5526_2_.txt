To our knowledge, no published study has examined the independent association between gout and kidney stone disease. METHODS: We used a national probability sample of the US population to determine the independent association between reported gout and history of kidney stone disease. RESULTS: Among men and women 20 years and older, 5.6% (10 million) reported the previous passage of a kidney stone and 2.7% (5.1 million) reported a diagnosis of gout by a physician.
