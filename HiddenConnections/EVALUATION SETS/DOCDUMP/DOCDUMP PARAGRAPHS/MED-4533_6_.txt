The relationship of genetics and environment is discussed in the context of the puzzle that infertility is inherited, which appears to be impossible from an evolutionary standpoint. Poor semen quality is related not only to testicular cancer but also to zygote development, in which cancer-like disruption of the genetic apparatus is observed, with serious implications for offspring health. This needs to be seen in the context that human reproduction is prone to a higher degree of impairment than that of other mammalian species, in relation to spermatogenesis, couple fertility, early pregnancy loss and embryonic aneuploidy; female- and male-mediated pathways are both implicated.
