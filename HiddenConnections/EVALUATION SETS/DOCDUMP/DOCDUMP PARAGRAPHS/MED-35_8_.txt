Responders in both groups had higher initial plasma cholesterol values than nonresponders. Although plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased slightly, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to cholesterol ratio (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol) remained constant for most individuals. The hypocholesterolemic effects were similar for both animal and soy protein (p less than 0.05) and fat (p less than 0.05) while on the experimental diet.
