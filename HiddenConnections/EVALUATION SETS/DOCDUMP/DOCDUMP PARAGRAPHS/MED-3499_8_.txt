It was associated with a high incidence of rest angina (83% in Group A vs. 51% in Group B, p = 0.0005) and a very high incidence of left main (34% vs. 10%, p = 0.0001) and three-vessel (82% vs. 54%, p = 0.001) coronary artery disease. The ejection fraction was lower as well in these patients (0.39 vs. 0.47, p = 0.046). Postprandial angina occurred at rest and on exertion, most commonly after dinner.
