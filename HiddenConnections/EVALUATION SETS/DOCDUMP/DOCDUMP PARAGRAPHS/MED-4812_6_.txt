CONCLUSIONS: Infants and young children with chronic constipation and anal fissure may consume larger amounts of cows milk than children with a normal bowel habit. Additionally, shorter duration of breastfeeding and early bottle feeding with cows milk may play a role in the development of constipation and anal fissure in infants and young children.
