Teeth were painted with fingernail polish to expose a 1 x 4 mm window and then soaked in tea for a total of 25 hours with teas refreshed every 5 hours. Teeth were then sectioned using a microtome and photographed using a polarized light microscope. Lesion depths (i.e., eroded surfaces) were measured using Image Pro Plus software.
