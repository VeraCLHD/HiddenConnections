Abstract Seven carboxylic acid haptens of 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN) were synthesized, coupled to cationized bovine serum albumin, and employed to raise specific antisera in rabbits. Two linkers of different lengths (C3H6COOH and C6H12COOH) were coupled to the C7-OH group and separated into their respective enantiomers yielding the first four haptens. Racemic derivatives with C4'-OH coupled linkers C5H10COOH and C9H18COOH were synthesized carrying a methylated C7-OH.
