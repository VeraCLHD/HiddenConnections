Dental examinations revealed significantly less missing teeth (P=0.018) but also more decayed (P=0.001) and eroded (P=0.026) teeth in vegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians had a higher level of education (P<0.001), but visited dentists significantly less frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetarians revealed better periodontal conditions (less inflammation signs, less periodontal damage and a better dental home care).
