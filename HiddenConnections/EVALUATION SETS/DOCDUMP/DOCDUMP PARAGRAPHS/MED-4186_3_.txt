RESULTS: The annual decrease (mean +/- SD) of the cerebral volume was 2.1% +/- 1.6% (P < .001). The average volume of the lateral ventricles on the second MRI was increased by 5.6% +/- 3.6% per year (P < .001). The average volume of the cerebellum on the second MRI was decreased by 1.2% +/- 2.2% per year (P < .001).
