Sixteen ewes were offered either: i) fresh forage (FF), ii) grass silage (GS), iii) grass hay (GH) or iv) concentrate and barley straw (CB). Animals offered FF diets had a greater concentration (P<0.001) of chlorophyll based compounds in their faeces and subsequent fluorescent emission spectra. In a second experiment we investigated a range of fluorescent markers against a basal concentrate and barley straw diet.
