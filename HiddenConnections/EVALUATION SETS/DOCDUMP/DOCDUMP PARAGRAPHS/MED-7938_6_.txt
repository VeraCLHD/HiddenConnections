The plates were incubated for 72 h and the revertant colonies were counted. The crude extract did not prove to be promutagenic. The ethanol extract of the broccoli flower head at 46 mg/plate suppressed the mutagenic effect induced by the corresponding positive mutagens on all the three tester strains used in this study.
