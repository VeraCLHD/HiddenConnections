Abstract PURPOSE: Because they have large variations in consumption, Asian countries are suitable settings for studies of the effect of relatively high-dose isoflavone intake on breast cancer risk. Nevertheless, no prospective study from Asia has assessed blood or urine levels as biomarkers of isoflavone intake. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 24,226 women ages 40 to 69 years in the Japan Public Health Center-based prospective study who responded to the baseline questionnaire and provided blood in 1990 to 1995 were observed to December 2002.
