In prospective analyses, only GL was associated with BV progression (adjusted OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00–1.05) and persistence (adjusted OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01–1.04) after adjustment. Both GL and NNR were associated with greater BV prevalence and GL was associated with an increase in BV persistence and acquisition. These results suggest that diet composition may contribute to vaginal flora imbalances and be important for elucidating the etiology of BV.
