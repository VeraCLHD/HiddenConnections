Half of the patients experienced adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea) during the diet and stopped the experiment prematurely.

The positive subjective effect experienced by the patients was not discernible in the more objective measures of disease activity (Health Assessment Questionnaire, duration of morning stiffness, pain at rest and pain on movement).
