Abstract The aqueous extracts of Hibiscus sabdariffa have been commonly used in folk medicine. Nevertheless, the compounds or metabolites responsible for its healthy effects have not yet been identified. The major metabolites present in rat plasma after acute ingestion of a polyphenol-enriched Hibiscus sabdariffa extract were characterized and quantified in order to study their bioavailability.
