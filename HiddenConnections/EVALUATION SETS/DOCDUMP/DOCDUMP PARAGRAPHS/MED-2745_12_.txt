Acceptability was adequate but waned over time, and mild transitory side effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Given the observed early reduction in LV and the progressive reduction in VAT, we suggest that the minimum duration for a preoperative VLED be 2 wk. Ideally, the duration should be 6 wk to achieve maximal LV reduction and significant reductions in VAT and body weight without compromising compliance and acceptability.
