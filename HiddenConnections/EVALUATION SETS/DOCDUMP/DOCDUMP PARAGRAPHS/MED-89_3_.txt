We found that Avns-enriched extract of oats (AvExO) had no effect on COX-2 expression, but it did inhibit COX enzyme activity and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages. Avns (AvExO, Avn-C, and the methylated form of Avn-C (CH3-Avn-C)) significantly inhibited cell proliferation of both COX-2-positive HT29, Caco-2, and LS174T, and COX-2-negative HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines, CH3-Avn-C being the most potent. However, Avns had no effect on COX-2 expression and PGE(2) production in Caco-2 and HT29 colon cancer cells.
