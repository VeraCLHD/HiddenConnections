The number of teeth with a loss of CALâ‰¥3 mm at any site over a year was calculated as 'periodontal disease events'. Poisson regression analysis was conducted, with dietary SFAs as the primary predictor of interest, to estimate their influence on periodontal disease events. High dietary SFA intake was significantly associated with a greater number of periodontal disease events among non-smokers.
