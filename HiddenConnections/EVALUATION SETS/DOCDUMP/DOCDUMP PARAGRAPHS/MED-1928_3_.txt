Computerized tomography (n = 7) showed reductions (P < 0.05) in the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the thigh (12.5%), all thigh muscles (14.7%), quadriceps femoris muscle (16.1%), and flexor muscles (14. 9%). Analysis of covariance showed that strength at T1 and changes in CSA were independent predictors of strength at T2.
