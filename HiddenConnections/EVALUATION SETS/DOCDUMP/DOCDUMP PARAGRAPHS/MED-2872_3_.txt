Additional positive features of this special vegan diet (SVD) are the high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, the absence of cholesterol, and the lower net acid production in comparison with a mixed diet. This study indicates that the results obtained with the SVD are similar to those obtained with the CLPD.
