CONCLUSIONS: This intensive cardiac rehabilitation program was feasible and sustainable for most patients who enrolled and was associated with numerous subjective and objective improvements in health outcomes. It demonstrates that the intervention works when it is administered by staff at multiple clinical/commmunity sites in four different states. These improvements were also seen in patients 65 years of age or older.
