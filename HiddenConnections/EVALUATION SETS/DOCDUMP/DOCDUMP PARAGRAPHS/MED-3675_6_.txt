PUMA expression is also PERK/ATF3-dependent, through tribbles 3 (TRB3)–regulated AKT inhibition and FoxO3a activation. DP5−/− mice are protected from high fat diet–induced loss of glucose tolerance and have twofold greater pancreatic β-cell mass. This study elucidates the crosstalk between lipotoxic ER stress and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis that causes β-cell death in diabetes.
