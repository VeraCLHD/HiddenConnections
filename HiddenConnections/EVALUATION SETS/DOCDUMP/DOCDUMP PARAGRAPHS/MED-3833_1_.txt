We conducted a review of the literature to investigate the association between specific dietary components and the risk of Barrettâ€™s esophagus (BE), EAC and EGJAC, supposing diet might be a risk factor for these tumors. Consumption of meat and high-fat meals has been found positively associated with EAC and EGJAC. An inverse association with increased intake of fruit, vegetables and antioxidants has been reported but this association was not consistent across all studies reviewed.
