Carriage of E. coli strains with a variety of urovirulence factors was quite common among healthy women. PFGE demonstrated that most of the isolates sharing the same serotypic characteristics and virulence factors in the urine and rectal swab samples from each subject were identical. CONCLUSIONS: Based upon precise genetic techniques, our results clearly support the fecal-perineal-urethral hypothesis, indicating that E. coli strains residing in the rectal flora serve as a reservoir for urinary tract infections, e.g., cystitis.
