RESULTS: Compared to lower intakes, > 3 g/4184 kJ (1000 kcal) of cereal fiber or > 6 servings of whole grains per week were associated with smaller decline in minimum coronary artery diameter (cereal fiber: -0.09 +/- 0.02 vs -0.04 +/- 0.02 mm, P = .03; whole grains: -0.10 +/- 0.02 vs -0.06 +/- 0.02 mm, P = .04) after adjustments for age, cardiovascular risk factors, and dietary intakes of saturated and polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, and alcohol. Progression in percent stenosis tended to be less in women with higher intake of cereal fiber (P = .10) or whole-grain foods (P = .09), after similar adjustments. Intakes of total, fruit, and vegetable fiber, and number of servings of refined grain, fruits, or vegetable were not associated with progression.
