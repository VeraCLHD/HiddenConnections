Results After adjustment for age, other demographics, lifestyle factors, and intakes of other foods or beverages, only processed meat intake was associated with telomere length. For every 1 serving/d greater intake of processed meat, the T/S ratio was 0.07 smaller (β ± SE: −0.07 ± 0.03, P = 0.006). Categorical analysis showed that participants consuming ≥1 serving of processed meat each week had 0.017 smaller T/S ratios than did nonconsumers.
