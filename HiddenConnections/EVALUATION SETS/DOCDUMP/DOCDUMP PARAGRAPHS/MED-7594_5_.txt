By the end of follow-up, 1,251 prostate cancer cases were confirmed. We used logistic regression to calculate the multivariable odds ratio (OR) of total, and Gleason 2-6 (n=993), 7 (n=199), and 8-10 (n=59) prostate cancer comparing low (normal: < 200 mg/dL) to high (borderline and elevated cholesterol: â‰¥ 200 mg/dL) serum cholesterol. Results Men with low cholesterol had a lower risk of Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer (OR=0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22-0.77) than men with high cholesterol.
