Latencies of brainstem evoked potential peaks I, III, and V at 20 and 40 Hz constituted the outcome variables. Mercury concentrations were determined in cord blood and maternal hair, and in the child's hair at ages 7 and 14. RESULTS: Latencies of peaks III and V increased by about 0.012 ms when the cord blood mercury concentration doubled.
