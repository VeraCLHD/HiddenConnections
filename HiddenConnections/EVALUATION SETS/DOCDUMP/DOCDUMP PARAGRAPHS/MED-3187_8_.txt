It was found that anticancer activity was stronger in the case of ORG fermented juices when compared with CONV ones. CONCLUSION: The obtained results indicate that ORG- and CONV-produced beetroots and fermented beetroot juices have different chemical properties and different impacts on cancer cells. It is necessary to continue research on this topic in order to confirm and understand the achieved results.
