Studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized the oestrogenicity of a number of industrial compounds and the pesticides o,p-DDT, kepone, methoxychlor, phenolic derivatives and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In the last 5 years, several environmental chemicals have been added to the list of xenoestrogens, including the pesticides toxaphene, dieldrin and endosulphan, and several different compounds used in the food industry, antioxidants such a t-butylhydroxyanisole; plasticizers such as benzylbutylphthalate and 4-OH-alkylphenols; and substances used in dental restorations, such as bisphenol-A. The relevance of these newly discovered endocrine disruptors to human health is now starting to emerge.
