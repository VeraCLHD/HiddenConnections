The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of 98 lumbar intervertebral disks was determined, and two-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography was performed on the corresponding 98 lumbar artery pairs (total arteries = 196). The degree of disk degeneration and the status of lumbar arteries were evaluated independently by two radiologists. ADC calculations were performed on the basis of the average signal intensities of the selected region of interest in lumbar disks.
