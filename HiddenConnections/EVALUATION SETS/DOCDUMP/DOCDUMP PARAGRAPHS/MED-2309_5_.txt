All the participants were assigned to the high-MeHg (H-MeHg, 27.0+/-10.4 microg/L) or low-MeHg (L-MeHg, 11.6+/-4.7 microg/L) groups based on the 75th percentile of their blood MeHg (19.2 microg/L), and then matched for cognitive function confounders: age, gender, and education levels. Higher abnormality rates for remote memory (p=0.036), mental manipulation (p=0.013), and orientation (p=0.005) were found in the H-MeHg group than in the L-MeHg group. Long-term consumption of MeHg-contaminated fish and seafood by residents living near this contaminated area may have persistent effects on their cognitive function.
