The purine content in all three species was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in egg white, but some values were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in chicken breast. The total protein content was 548.9 g kg(-1) dry matter (DM) in mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), 551.6 g kg(-1) DM in superworm (Zophobas atratus) and 564.9 g kg(-1) DM in cricket (Gryllus assimilis). CONCLUSION: Larvae of mealworm and superworm are protein-rich and purine-low meat alternatives.
