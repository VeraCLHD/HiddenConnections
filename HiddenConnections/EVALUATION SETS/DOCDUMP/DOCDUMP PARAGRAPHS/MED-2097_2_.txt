OBJECTIVE: We explored the association between bone mineral status and fruit and vegetable intakes in adolescent boys and girls (aged 16-18 y), young women (aged 23-37 y), and older men and women (aged 60-83 y). DESIGN: Bone mineral measurements of the whole body, hip, and spine were made in all subjects by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Information on health and lifestyle and physical activity was obtained by questionnaire.
