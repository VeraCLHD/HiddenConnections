The increases in cytokine synthesis were not dependent on changes in the number of monocytes, nor were they related to the significant rise of CD45RO+, and the concomitant decrease of CD45RA+, occurring in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from aged subjects. The increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by stimulated mononuclear cells of healthy aged subjects may be relevant to several aspects of age-associated pathological events, including atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, fibrosis and dementia.
