Logistic regression models and generalized additive models were fit to assess the relationship between w-3 PUFA intake or fish consumption and the incidence of these outcomes. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: 173 cases of depression, 335 cases of anxiety, and 4 cases of stress were observed during 2-year follow-up.
