The association was attenuated when height was added to the model (RR=1.06, 95% CI 0.98–1.14). Teenage milk consumption was not associated with hip fractures in women (RR=1.00, 95% CI 0.95–1.05 per glass per day). Conclusion and Relevance Greater milk consumption during teenage years was not associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults.
