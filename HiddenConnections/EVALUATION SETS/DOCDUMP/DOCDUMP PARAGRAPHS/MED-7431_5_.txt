Seropositivity was associated with female sex (relative risk [RR] = 2.45, P = 0.049), hiring a domestic worker for child care duties (RR = 3.79, P = 0.05), and with employees from Central America (RR = 2.70, P = 0.0001). Exposure to T. solium in this community is unexpectedly high. Widespread employment of domestic workers from endemic regions and high employee turnover contributes to exposure risk.
