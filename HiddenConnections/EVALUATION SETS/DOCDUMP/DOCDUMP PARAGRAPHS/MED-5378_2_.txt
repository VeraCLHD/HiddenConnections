Over the past 10 years, focus has, therefore, more been directed towards protective factors that could enhance the development of tolerance to allergens which were previously encountered early in life, but are now lost in modern affluent societies. In particular, the role of childhood infections has been discussed, but so far these studies have not been conclusive. Recent epidemiological studies and experimental research suggest that the microbial environment and exposure to microbial products in infancy modifies immune responses and enhances the development of tolerance to ubiquitous allergens.
