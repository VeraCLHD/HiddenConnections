Unusual signs caused us to arrange a computed tomography scan, which showed that a foreign body had penetrated the left sternocleidomastoid muscle to the subcutaneous layer, with extensive emphysema in the neck. We extracted the foreign body with a 1-cm horizontal incision of the neck under general anesthesia. The patient returned to a normal diet and was discharged on day 5 of hospitalization without further morbidity.
