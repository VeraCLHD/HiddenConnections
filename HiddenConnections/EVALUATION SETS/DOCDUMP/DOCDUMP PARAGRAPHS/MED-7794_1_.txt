A case is reported in a 30-year-old woman who developed persistent infection of a healing operative wound on the dorsum of the right foot, after possible contamination by river water while canoeing. The wound was debrided 2 months later. Histologically, infected tissues contained mixed suppurative and granulomatous inflammation associated with endosporulating, round to oval microorganisms, ranging from 6-9 microns in diameter.
