However, the mean sensory acceptance scores were significantly higher for the SDRs compared to the SJBs (50.7 ± 1.7 vs. 44.3 ± 2.7). Consuming SDRs or SJBs during 120 minutes of intense cycling results in similar subsequent TT performances and are equally effective in maintaining blood glucose levels during exercise. Therefore, SDRs are a natural, pleasant, cost-effective CHO alternative to commercial SJBs that can be used during moderate- to high-intensity endurance exercise.
