Abstract The supraclavicular region is a common site for lymph node metastases. A commonly reported type of nonmalignant (18)F-FDG uptake on PET imaging in the supraclavicular region is "muscle uptake" purportedly due to muscle contraction in tense patients during the (18)F-FDG uptake phase. PET/CT offers the unique opportunity to correlate PET findings with CT anatomy in the supraclavicular region.
