Methods Exposure data were collected from 1,591 cases and 2,515 controls during in-person interviews in a population-based case-control study of NHL in the San Francisco Bay Area. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for potential confounders. Results Pet owners had a reduced risk of NHL (OR=0.71,CI=0.52 –0.97) and diffuse large-cell and immunoblastic large-cell (DLCL;OR=0.58,CI=0.39 –0.87) compared with those who never had owned a pet.
