Sperm count and progressive motility showed significant positive relationship with SOD. The SOD, CAT, and thiols positively whereas LPO and PC negatively associated with elevated sperm count. CONCLUSION: Insufficient antioxidant enzymes and increased oxidative stress may attribute to the risk of declining semen quality and hence protective role for antioxidant enzymes against the oxidative damage cannot be ruled out.
