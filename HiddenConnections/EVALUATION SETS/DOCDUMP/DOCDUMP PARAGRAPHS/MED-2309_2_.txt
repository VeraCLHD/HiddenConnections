The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI C-2.0) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess the participants' cognitive functions. We found a significantly high correlation (r=0.979; p<0.001) between blood T-Hg (17.3+/-10.9 microg/L) and MeHg (15.3+/-9.2 microg/L). We also found significantly higher blood MeHg levels in participants with high local fish and seafood consumption, which revealed that dietary intake was the major exposure route of MeHg.
