Abstract AIMS: Various spices display insulin-potentiating activity in vitro, and in particular, cinnamon spice and its phenolic extracts have been shown to exhibit these capabilities. In vivo study shows that cinnamon may have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis; therefore the aim of this study was to further investigate this phenomenon in humans. METHODS: Seven lean healthy male volunteers, aged 26 +/- 1 years, body mass index 24.5 +/- 0.3 kg/m(2) (mean +/- s.e.m.), underwent three oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) supplemented with either a 5 g placebo (OGTT(control)), 5 g of cinnamon (OGTT(cin)), or 5 g of cinnamon taken 12 h before (OGTT(cin12hpre)) in a randomized-crossover design.
