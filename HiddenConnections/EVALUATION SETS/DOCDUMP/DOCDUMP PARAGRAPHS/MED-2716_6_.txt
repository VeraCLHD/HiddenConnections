PWV showed significant positive correlation with age (garlic group, r=.44; control group, r=.52) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (garlic group, r=.48; control group, r=.54). With any degree of increase in age or SBP, PWV increased less in the garlic group than in the control group (P<.0001). ANCOVA and multiple regression analyses demonstrated that age and SBP were the most important determinants of PWV and that the effect of garlic on PWV was independent of confounding factors.
