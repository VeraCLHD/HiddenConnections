Subjective appetite ratings in the interval between the mid-morning snack and lunch were consistent with dose-dependent enhanced satiety following the almond snacks. However, in the interval between lunch and dinner, appetite ratings were not dependent on the mid-morning snack. Conclusion Almonds might be a healthy snack option since their acute satiating effects are likely to result in no net increase in energy consumed over a day.
