The effect of the test substances on the UV-induced erythema was measured photometrically after 48 hours.Additionally,the skin tolerance of the test preparations was assessed on non-irradiated skin. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, the lipolotion with 0.5% coriander oil significantly reduced the UV-induced erythema, but it was not as effective as hydrocortisone. The skin tolerance of both coriander oil concentrations was excellent.
