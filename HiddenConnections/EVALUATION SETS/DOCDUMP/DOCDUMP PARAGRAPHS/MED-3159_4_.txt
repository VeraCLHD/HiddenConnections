Metabolomics experiments aim to quantify all metabolites in a cellular system (cell or tissue) under defined states and at different time points so that the dynamics of any biotic, abiotic, or genetic perturbation can be accurately assessed. This article provides an overview of metabolomics and discusses how data are generated and analyzed within a systems biology framework. The role of metabolomics in nutrigenomics is also discussed, as are the concepts of the human being a superorganism and the complexities required to be overcome to understand human health and disease.
