RESULTS: Butyrate and serum starvation (SS) both induced a cell cycle withdrawal by 24 hours. In response to EGF treatment, SS cells exhibited a growth spurt and induced c-fos and c-jun proto-oncogene expression, whereas butyrate-treated cells exhibited minimal growth response to EGF. This relative unresponsiveness to EGF in butyrate-treated cells corresponded to a dramatic decline in EGF receptor levels when compared to untreated controls.
