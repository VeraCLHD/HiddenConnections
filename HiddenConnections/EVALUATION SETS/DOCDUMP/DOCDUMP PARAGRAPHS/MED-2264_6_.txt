Substituting ASB for any SSB did not reduce the incidence in analyses accounting for energy intake and adiposity. Substituting one serving/day of water or unsweetened tea/coffee for soft drinks and for sweetened-milk beverages reduced the incidence by 14%â€“25%. If sweet beverage consumers reduced intake to below 2% energy, 15% of incident diabetes might be prevented.
