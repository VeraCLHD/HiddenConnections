Seventy-eight participants were randomly divided into three groups. Following run-in, half the volunteers from each group consumed 25Â g/d of a legume fibre, comprising blue lupin fibre, white lupin fibre, and soya fibre for two weeks. The other half received the same amount of citrus fibre (active comparator).
