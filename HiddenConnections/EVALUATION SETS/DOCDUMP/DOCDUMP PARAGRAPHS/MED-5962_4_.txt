These contradictory considerations may be explained by the existence of a two-faced relationship between protein and bone, with simultaneous positive and negative pathways. In opposition to the negative effects of dietary acid load, protein may exert positive effects related to improving calcium absorption, increasing insulin-like growth factor 1, or improving lean body mass, which, in turn, improves bone strength. Putative mechanisms behind these pathways are reviewed here, and some limitations in the historical literature as well as suggested measures to counter these in the future are identified.
