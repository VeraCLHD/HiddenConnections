Here we review current knowledge on established as well as less risk factors for the development of BO. Additionally, we summarize today's status on the use of chemoprevention aiming to reduce the risk of cancer progression in BO patients. METHODS: We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library using the MeSH terms "Barrett's esophagus" and "Barrett esophagus," both alone and combined with the terms "risk factor," "aetiology," "diet," or "prevention."
