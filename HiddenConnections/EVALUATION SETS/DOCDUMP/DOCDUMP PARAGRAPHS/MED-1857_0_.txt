Abstract Evidence supporting aspirin and resistant starch (RS) for colorectal cancer prevention comes from epidemiological and laboratory studies (aspirin and RS) and randomized controlled clinical trials (aspirin). Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) strikes young people and, untreated, confers virtually a 100% risk of colorectal cancer and early death. We conducted an international, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin (600 mg/day) and/or RS (30 g/day) for from 1 to 12 years to prevent disease progression in FAP patients from 10 to 21 years of age.
