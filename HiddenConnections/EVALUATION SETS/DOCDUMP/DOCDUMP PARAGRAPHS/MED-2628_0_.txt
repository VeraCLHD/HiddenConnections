Abstract BACKGROUND: The dietary intake of n-3 (omega-3) long-chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs) from fish may improve endothelial function and arterial stiffness. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to test the hypothesis that increasing intakes of n-3 LC-PUFAs-equivalent to the consumption of 1, 2, or 4 portions of oily fish per week-favorably affects endothelial function and arterial stiffness. DESIGN: A parallel-design, randomized, double-blind study compared daily doses of 0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs (EPA:DHA ratio of 1.51:1) with placebo (refined olive oil).
