Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of anthocyanins from cherries on Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats. METHODS: Arthritis was induced intradermally by injection with 0.1 mL of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the right hind footpad of male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Anthocyanins at 40, 20 and 10 mg/kg (body weight) were administered orally to the treated rats for 28 days after the injection.
