All infertile groups had significantly lower ROS-TAC scores than control. ROS-TAC score identified 80% of patients and was significantly better than ROS at identifying varicocele and idiopathic infertility. The 13 patients whose partners later achieved pregnancies had a mean ROS-TAC score of 47.7 +/- 13.2, similar to controls but significantly higher than the 39 patients who remained infertile (35.8 +/- 15.0; P < 0.01).
