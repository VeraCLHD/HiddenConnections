Breakfast caused a small but significant increase in plasma methionine (22.2 +/- 20.6%) and a brief, nonsignificant increase followed by a significant decline in free homocysteine. However, changes in total and bound homocysteine were small. After dinner, there was a marked increase in plasma methionine by 16.7 +/- 8.9 mumol/L (87.9 +/- 49%), which was associated with a rapid and marked increase in free homocysteine (33.7 +/- 19.6%, 4 h after dinner) and a moderate and slow increase in total (13.5 +/- 7.5%, 8 h) and protein-bound (12.6 +/- 9.4%, 8 h) homocysteine.
