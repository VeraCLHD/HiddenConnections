By contrast, although basophils (16 (5) cells/μl) and CD4+ CD45RO+ RA+ lymphocytes (19 (4) cells/μl) increased in controls, no increase in these cell types was found in children with asthma. Conclusions Exercise increased many circulating inflammatory cells in both children with asthma and controls. Circulating inflammatory cells did increase in children with asthma, but not to a greater degree than in controls.
