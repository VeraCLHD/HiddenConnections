The risk evaluation of oestrogenic growth-promoting agents is limited by analytical uncertainties. Residues of oestradiol-17alpha and the importance of oestrogen conjugates are widely unknown. The performance of mass spectrometry still needs to be improved for confirmation of oestrogen concentrations in most food.
