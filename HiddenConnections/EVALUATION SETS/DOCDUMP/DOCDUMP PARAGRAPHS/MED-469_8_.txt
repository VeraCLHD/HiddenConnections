This needs to be seen in the context that human reproduction is prone to a higher degree of impairment than that of other mammalian species, in relation to spermatogenesis, couple fertility, early pregnancy loss and embryonic aneuploidy; female- and male-mediated pathways are both implicated. It is unclear whether such human specificity originated on an evolutionary/genetic or a historico-social timescale, which is important in relation to pathogenesis. The evidence clearly indicates that the currently most popular explanation for male reproductive system impairment, the endocrine disruption hypothesis, cannot explain the main features of the descriptive epidemiology.
