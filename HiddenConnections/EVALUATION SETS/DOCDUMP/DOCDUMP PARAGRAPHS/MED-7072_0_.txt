Abstract Scope Observational studies have evaluated the relationship between green tea intake and cancers of the ovary and endometrium, but we are not aware of the published studies on green tea intake and risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva. Methods and results A critical review of the published literature on tea intake and risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers was conducted. In meta-analyses, we report inverse associations for green tea intake and risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.80), and for green tea and risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98).
