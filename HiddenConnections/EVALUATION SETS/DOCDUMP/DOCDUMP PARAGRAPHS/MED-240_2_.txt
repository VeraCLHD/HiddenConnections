Accumulated evidence suggests that naturally occurring phyto-compounds, such as polyphenolic antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, herbs and nuts, may potentially hinder neurodegeneration, and improve memory and cognitive function. Nuts such as walnut have also demonstrated neuroprotective effect against AD. The molecular mechanisms behind the curative effects rely mainly on the action of phytonutrients on distinct signalling pathways associated with protein folding and neuroinflammation.
