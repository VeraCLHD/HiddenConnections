After the LDL apheresis, the changes in the coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow in response to an infusion of 50 microg/min of acetylcholine increased significantly compared to the pre-apheresis values (from -19.7 +/- 4.8 to -2.9 +/- 3.0% [P < 0.01] and from 80.7 +/- 27.6 to 155.3 +/- 23.5% [P < 0.01], respectively). The LDL apheresis did not significantly change the response of either parameter to infusion with isosorbide dinitrate or papaverine. The endothelial function of the epicardial coronary artery and the coronary microvasculature improved in hypercholesterolemic patients after only a single LDL apheresis, a procedure that markedly reduces the serum level of LDL cholesterol.
