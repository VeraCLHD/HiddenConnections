DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched for studies from first date available to July 2011 using the following search terms: (dementia OR cognitive impairment OR mild cognitive impairment) AND (omega-3 OR omega-6 OR polyunsaturated fatty acid OR docosahexaenoic acid OR DHA OR eicosapentaenoic acid OR EPA). The search was limited to literature in English and to human studies.
