The polyp patients and Japanese-Hawaiians were considered to be groups at high risk of colon cancer, and the rural native Japanese and rural native Africans were considered to be groups at low risk. The North American Caucasians were found to have a flora composition intermediate between these two groups. Fifteen bacterial taxa from the human fecal flora were significantly associated with high risk of colon cancer, and five were significantly associated with low risk of colon cancer.
