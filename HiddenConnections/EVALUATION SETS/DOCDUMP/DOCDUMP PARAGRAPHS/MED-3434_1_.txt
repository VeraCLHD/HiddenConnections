Our aim was to determine whether tear fluid osmolarity (T(osm)) assessed using a new, portable, noninvasive, rapid collection and measurement device tracks hydration. PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare changes in T(osm) and another widely used noninvasive marker, urine specific gravity (USG), with changes in P(osm) during hypertonic-hypovolemia. METHODS: In a randomized order, 14 healthy volunteers exercised in the heat on one occasion with fluid restriction (FR) until 1%, 2%, and 3% body mass loss (BML) and with overnight fluid restriction until 08:00 h the following day, and on another occasion with fluid intake (FI).
