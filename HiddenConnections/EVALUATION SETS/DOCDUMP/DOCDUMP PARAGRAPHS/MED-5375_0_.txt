Abstract Over the last 40 years there have been constant reports concerning environmental chemicals with hormone-like effects in wildlife. An endocrine disruptor is an exogenous substance that causes adverse health effects in an intact organism or its progeny, secondary to changes in endocrine function. Endocrine disruptors of widely diverse chemical structures that have oestrogenic properties are known as oestrogenic xenobiotics or xenoestrogens.
