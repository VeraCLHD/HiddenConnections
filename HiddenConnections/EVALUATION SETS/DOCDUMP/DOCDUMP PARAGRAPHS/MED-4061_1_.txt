Chronic inflammation and associated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the colon epithelium are causally related to epithelial carcinogenesis, proliferation, and tumor growth. We examined the effect of avenanthramides (Avns), unique polyphenols from oats with anti-inflammatory properties, on COX-2 expression in macrophages, colon cancer cell lines, and on proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines. We found that Avns-enriched extract of oats (AvExO) had no effect on COX-2 expression, but it did inhibit COX enzyme activity and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages.
