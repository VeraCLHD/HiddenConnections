However, an interaction between PRALdiet and calcium intake was observed with proximal femur BMD (p=0.08). An inverse association between PRALdiet and proximal femur BMD was detected among men <800 mg/d dietary calcium (p=0.02); and no associations â‰¥800 mg/d (p=0.98). A significant interaction with PRALtotal was not observed.
