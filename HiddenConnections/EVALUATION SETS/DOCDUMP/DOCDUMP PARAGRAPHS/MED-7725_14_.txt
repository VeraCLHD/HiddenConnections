The remaining 22 strains were divided into 11 atypical genotypes. These results indicate high parasite prevalence and high genetic diversity of T. gondii in lambs, which has important implications in public health. We believe this is the first in-depth genetic analysis of T. gondii isolates from sheep in the USA.
