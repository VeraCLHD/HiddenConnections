The challenge for the primary care physician and diabetologist is to attain excellent glycemic control and aggressive control of blood pressure, while assuring that every patient has appropriate dilated fundus examinations at least annually, preferably by an ophthalmologist or retinal specialist, and regular screening for microalbuminuria. With such medical management, appropriate intervention can occur to reduce the risk of blindness and renal failure and to lessen the burden from diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy.
