Following an initial reduction of plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels on all diets, the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations stabilized. On low-cholesterol diets the concentration of each of the major lipoprotein classes were similar during the soy and the casein dietary periods. On cholesterol-enriched diets, the concentration of LDL-C stabilized at a 16% lower level on soy protein than on the casein diet (p less than 0.02), while the concentration of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was 16% higher (p less than 0.01).
