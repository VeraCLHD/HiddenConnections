Group A showed more calf blood pooling and a decrease in thigh blood flow during sitting in comparison with the control group, but after 1 h of sitting hemodynamic responses of the two groups were similar. Sitting for 5 h (1st vs. 5th h) resulted in an increase in calf venous pooling (17%) and a decrease in calf BF (13%), a reduction in gravitational pooling in the thigh (corresponding to increased pooling in the calf), increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressures (6 and 7.3 mmHg, respectively), and minor changes in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. The results show that it is necessary to sit for 1 h before hemodynamic responses can be assessed in this position, regardless of the posture maintained previously.
