Secondary aims were to determine the effects of a high salt meal on augmentation index (AIx) a measure of arterial stiffness and markers of endothelial function. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomised cross-over study 16 healthy normotensive adults consumed a low sodium soup containing 5 mmol Na and a high sodium soup containing 65 mmol Na. Sodium, plasma nitrate/nitrite, endothelin-1 (ET-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), vasopressin (AVP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations before and every 30 min after the soup for 2 h. Blood pressure (BP) and AI were also measured at these time points.
