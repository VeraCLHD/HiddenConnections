Treatments were given for eight weeks each with one group (n = 16) receiving placebo followed by cyclosporin and another (n = 17) receiving cyclosporin and then placebo. Disease activity, extent of disease, sleep and itch, topical steroid use, and adverse events were assessed every two weeks. Both extent and activity of dermatitis were significantly improved (p less than 0.001) as were subjective measures of disease.
