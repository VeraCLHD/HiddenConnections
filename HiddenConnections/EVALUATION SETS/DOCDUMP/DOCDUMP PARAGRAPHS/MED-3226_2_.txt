Two recent epidemiologic studies indicate that there is a decreased prevalence of AD associated with the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins). Experiments in cell culture and in vivo demonstrate that treatment with statins reduces production of Abeta. The authors discuss how cholesterol might modulate Abeta deposit formation.
