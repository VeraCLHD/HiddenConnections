Well-designed studies have shown that diffusion is a very slow process, and that the endplate is the main structure that controls the process of diffusion. Contrast MRI studies have also made it possible to identify endplate breaks in vivo. In the future this technique may be applied to study the influence of smoking, mechanical loading of the discs, abnormal posture, and atherosclerosis of the lumbar arteries on diffusion.
