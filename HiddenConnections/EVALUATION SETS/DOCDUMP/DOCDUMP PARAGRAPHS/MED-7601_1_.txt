We have examined the association between intake frequency of various types of soft drinks and the concentration of serum triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the cross-sectional Oslo Health Study. A total of 14 188 subjects of the altogether 18,770 participants of the study had data on intake frequency of colas and non-colas, with or without sugar. The population sample consisted of both sexes and 3 age groups: group 1 (30 years of age), group 2 (40 and 45 years of age), and group 3 (59-60 years of age).
