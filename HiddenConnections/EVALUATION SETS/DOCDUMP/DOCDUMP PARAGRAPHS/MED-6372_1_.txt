Other studies have demonstrated an in vitro action on oral plaque biofilm formation and desorption. This study evaluated whether the activity displayed in vitro by food compounds could affect the microbiological composition of saliva and dental plaque of subjects with a diet rich in these foods, comparing the results with those obtained from subjects with a different diet. The foods considered were: coffee, barley coffee, tea and wine.
