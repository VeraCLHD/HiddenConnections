Plasma triglyceride iAUC differed between interventions (overall P = 0.023). Physical activity lowered values by 6.3 mmol · L(-1) · 9 h(-1) (95% CI: 1.8, 10.7 mmol · L(-1) · 9 h(-1); P = 0.006) when compared with regular activity breaks. CONCLUSION: Regular activity breaks were more effective than continuous physical activity at decreasing postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in healthy, normal-weight adults.
