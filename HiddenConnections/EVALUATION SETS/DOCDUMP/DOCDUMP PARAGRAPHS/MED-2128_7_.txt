Risk estimates for OPs grouped according to different presumed functionalities and toxicities were similar and did not allow us to distinguish between them. However, we observed exposure-response patterns with exposure to an increasing number of OPs. Conclusions This study adds strong evidence that OPs are implicated in the etiology of idiopathic PD.
