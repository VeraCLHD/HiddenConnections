Lipotoxicity is a well-known concept in the explanation of initiation of insulin resistance. Although there are several prevailing hypotheses about the cellular/molecular mechanisms of lipotoxicity, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperinsulinemia, and ER stress, the relative importance of these hypothesized events remains to be determined. The role of hyperinsulinemia is relatively under documented in the literature for the initiation of insulin resistance.
