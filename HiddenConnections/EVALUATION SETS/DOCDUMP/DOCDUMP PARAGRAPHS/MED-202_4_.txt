The average volume of the lateral ventricles on the second MRI was increased by 5.6% +/- 3.6% per year (P < .001). The average volume of the cerebellum on the second MRI was decreased by 1.2% +/- 2.2% per year (P < .001). Even though the average cerebral volume was significantly different between men and women on initial MRI and second MRI, the percentage change of the age-related cerebral volume decrease in male and female brains between initial MRI and second MRI were identical.
