Results: Individuals in the highest quintile of nitrite intake from animal sources compared with those in the lowest quintile, had an increased risk of total RCC and clear cell subtype (HR=1.28, 95% CI, 1.10–1.49 and HR=1.68, 95% CI, 1.25–2.27, respectively). Nitrite from processed meats and other animal sources were associated with increased clear cell adenocarcinoma risk (HR=1.33, 95% CI, 1.01–1.76 and HR=1.78, 95% CI, 1.34–2.36, respectively). We found no association for nitrite intake from plant sources or nitrate intake overall.
