Abstract Point-of-care evidence-based medicine websites allow physicians to answer clinical queries using recent evidence at the bedside.

As many of these sites summarise the literature and provide recommendations, we sought to assess the role of conflicts of interest in two widely used websites: UpToDate and Dynamed.
