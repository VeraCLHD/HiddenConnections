The respective means of the maximum 11 residue less than mu H greater than for the amphipathic helical and control peptides were 0.46 (+/-/-0.07) and 0.33 (0.07) (P + 0.004). To better reflect the amphipathic potential of the entire peptide, the percent of 11 residue segments in each peptide above a particular less than mu H greater than was plotted vs less than mu H greater than. The resulting curves are referred to as HM-C.
