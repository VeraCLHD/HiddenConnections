Abstract The role of each Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet component in blood pressure (BP) of patients with diabetes is still uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible associations of the recommended food groups of the DASH diet eating plan with BP values in patients with type 2 diabetes. In the present cross-sectional study, 225 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 61·1 (SD 10·4) years; diabetes duration 13·1 (SD 9·1) years; males 48·4 %; BMI 28·5 (SD 4·3) kg/m(2); HbA1c 7·1 (SD 1·3) %; systolic BP 136·7 (SD 20·0) mmHg; diastolic BP 78·4 (SD 11·8) mmHg) without dietary counselling during the previous 6 months had their dietary intake assessed by 3 d weighed-diet records.
