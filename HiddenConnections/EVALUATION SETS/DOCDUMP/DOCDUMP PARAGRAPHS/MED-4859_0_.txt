Abstract Almost all types of newborn respiratory failure are reversible. However, supportive treatment (oxygen and positive airway pressure) can damage the lung, and newborn respiratory failure remains a major cause of morbidity and death in infants. Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) provides life support while allowing the lung to "rest."
