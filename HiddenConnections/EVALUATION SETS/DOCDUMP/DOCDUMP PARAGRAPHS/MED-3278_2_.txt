Methods We examined the relationship between systemic atherosclerosis, Alzheimer type pathology and dementia in autopsies from 200 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a prospective study of the effect of aging on cognition, 175 of whom had complete body autopsies. Results Using a quantitative analysis of atherosclerosis in the aorta, heart and intracranial vessels, we found no relationship between the degree of atherosclerosis in any of these systems and the degree of Alzheimerâ€™s type brain pathology. However, we found that the presence of intracranial but not coronary or aortic atherosclerosis significantly increased the odds of dementia, independent of cerebral infarction.
