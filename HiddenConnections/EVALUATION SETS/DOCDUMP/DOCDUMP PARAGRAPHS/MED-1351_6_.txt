Compared to controls, a significant post-intervention (3 months) decrease in A:V ratio in the intervention group (p=.01) was self-maintained 3 months post-intervention (p=0.049). At each assessment, the A:V ratio was correlated with lycopene, fiber, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol; four dietary components linked to clinically relevant outcomes in CaP. Change in A:V ratio was also significantly correlated with changes in fiber, saturated fat and dietary cholesterol intake.
