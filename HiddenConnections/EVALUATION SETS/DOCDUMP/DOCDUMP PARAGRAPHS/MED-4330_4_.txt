The overwhelming evidence presented in this chapter demonstrates that limiting the embryo transfer in in vitro fertilization to two embryos would significantly reduce adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes by reducing the incidence of high order multiple pregnancies without reducing take-home-baby rates. Secondary prevention by multifetal pregnancy reduction is effective, but not acceptable to all patients. New developments in blastocyst culture, single embryo transfer, embryo cryopreservation and pre-implantation aneuploidy exclusion, should allow improvements in pregnancy rates without increasing multiple pregnancies.
