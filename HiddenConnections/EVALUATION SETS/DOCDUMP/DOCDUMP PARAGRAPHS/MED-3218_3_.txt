Research that has contributed to our understanding of the beneficial effects that kiwifruit may have on immune responses spans from in vitro studies using cell lines and human blood cells, to using animal models targeting both mucosal and systemic immunity. Some limited human intervention trials have been undertaken and are described, in which kiwifruit has been shown to influence a number of biomarkers of oxidative stress and beneficial immune responses, to reduce the incidence and severity of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections and potentially be more beneficial than supplementation with vitamin C alone.
