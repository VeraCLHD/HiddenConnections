TPL induced loss of cell viability was determined by MTT assay. After 72h incubation, the IC 50 values for MCF 7 was found to be approximately 8microg/ml and that for T 47 D was approximately 26microg/ml. Moreover, TPL inhibited the clonogenic growth of MCF 7 cells, which was significantly recovered by pifithrin-alpha, the p53 inhibitor.
