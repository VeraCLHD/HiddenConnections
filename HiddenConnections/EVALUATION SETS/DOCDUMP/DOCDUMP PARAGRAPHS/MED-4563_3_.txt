A Western dietary pattern, characterized by higher intake of red and processed meats, potato chips, sugary beverages, sweets, high fat dairy, eggs, and refined grains, was associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer among men (95% CI 1.3-4.2, p-trend=0.008); but was not associated with risk among women. Among men, those in the upper quintiles of the Western diet and lower quintiles of the Prudent diet had a 3-fold increased risk. Consistent with what has been recommended for several other chronic diseases, consuming a diet rich in plant-based foods, whole grains, and white meat, might reduce risk of pancreatic cancer.
