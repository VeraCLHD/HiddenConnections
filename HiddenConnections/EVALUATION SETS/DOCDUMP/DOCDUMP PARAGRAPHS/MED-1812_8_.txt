However, the levels of EPA (ES = -0.44, P = .002), but not DHA or other PUFAs, were significantly lower in patients with predementia syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the important role of n-3 PUFAs in the pathophysiology of dementia. In addition, the analyses of predementia studies indicate that EPA might be not only a disease-state marker but also a risk factor for cognitive impairment.
