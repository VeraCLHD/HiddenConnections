The men given fish advice had 29% lower 2-year all-cause mortality; the other forms of advice did not have any significant effects. The Diet and Angina Randomized Trial (DART-2) involved 3114 men (mean age 61.1 years) with stable angina, who were followed up for 3-9 years. Advice to eat oily fish or take fish oil did not affect all-cause mortality, but it was associated with a significant increase in sudden cardiac death (P=0.018), and this effect was largely confined to the subgroup given fish oil capsules.
