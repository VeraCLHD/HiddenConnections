Abstract AIM: An Australian study of older, community-dwelling women found that 80% would rather be dead than experience loss of independence and nursing home admission after a bad hip fracture. We re-examined this issue using a conjoint analysis approach. METHODS: We asked older hospital patients with a history of falls, fracture or osteoporosis to imagine they had a hip fracture resulting in significant residual disability.
