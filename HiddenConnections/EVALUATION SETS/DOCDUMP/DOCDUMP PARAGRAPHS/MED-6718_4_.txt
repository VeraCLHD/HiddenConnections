They received during winter (a) 28,000 IU (700 Î¼g) vitamin D(2) via the experimental soup, or (b) 28,000 IU vitamin D(2) via a supplement or (c) placebo, respectively. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, serum 25OHD was significantly higher in the mushroom than in the placebo group (P=0.001). The serum 25OHD concentrations in the mushroom and supplement groups rose significantly and similarly over the study period by 3.9 nmol/l (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.9, 4.8) and by 4.7 nmol/l per week (95% CI: 3.8, 5.7), respectively.
