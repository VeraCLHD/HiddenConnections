Individuals who consumed more NSP in their diet (19 +/- 7 g/d) excreted more than 150 g faeces per day and had higher quantities of faecal-RS and -NSP; faster transit times; higher concentrations of short chain fatty acids and lower concentrations of potentially harmful ammonia and phenols. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of RS and NSP in the colon may be required to achieve an optimal luminal environment conducive to 'colonic health'. The results also support the suggestion that faecal output (< or > 150 g/d) may provide a useful index of colon cancer risk.
