Recent advances in molecular and genetic research and better understanding of mechanisms of blastic cell transformation have led to efforts to improve cancer risk assessment for populations exposed to this family of xenobiotics. In risk assessment, low dose extrapolation of cancer incidence data from both experimental animals and epidemiology studies has been largely based on models assuming linear correlation at low doses, despite existence of evidence showing otherwise. Another weakness of ED risk assessment is poor exposure data in ecological studies.
