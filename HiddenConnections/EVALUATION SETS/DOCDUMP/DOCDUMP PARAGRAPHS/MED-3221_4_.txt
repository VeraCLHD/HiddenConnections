Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol oxidation products are of importance in generation of Alzheimer's disease, possibly induced by Abeta-produced hydrogen peroxide.

The possible role of cholesterol in tau fibrillization, tauopathies and in some other non-Abeta amyloidogenic disorders is surveyed.
