Abstract There is increasing evidence implicating a dietary source of plasma lipid peroxides that become elevated in the postprandial state. This phenomenon may be a contributing factor to the correlation found between postprandial hyperlipidemia and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Using a newly developed method for measuring lipid hydroperoxides directly in plasma, a pilot study was performed which revealed that lipid hydroperoxides are indeed elevated following a fatty meal.
