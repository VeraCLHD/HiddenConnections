DESIGN: Serum levels of copper sampled in AD patients and healthy controls indicate a copper homeostasis imbalance in AD. On this basis, 34 AD patients were enrolled in a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the copper d-penicillamine-chelating agent. Nine patients for each group completed the trial.
