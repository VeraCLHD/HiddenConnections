Our analysis was limited our analysis to participants with no knowledge of their diverticular disease, to reduce the risk of biased responses. Results Constipation was not associated with an increased risk of diverticulosis. Participants with less frequent bowel movements (BM: <7/wk) had reduced odds of diverticulosis compared to those with regular (7/wk) BM (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40â€“0.80).
