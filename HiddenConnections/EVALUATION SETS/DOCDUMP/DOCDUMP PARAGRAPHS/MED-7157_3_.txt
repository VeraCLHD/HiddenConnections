RESULTS: The mean vegetable and fruit intakes of cases (155.62 (SD 88.84) and 248.32 (SD 188.17) g/day) were significantly lower (p<0.01) than controls (199.14 (SD 121.41) and 304.09 (SD 253.72) g/day). A substantial reduction in COPD risk was found by increasing daily total vegetable intake, p for trend=0.037. The prevalence of breathlessness also decreased with vegetable consumption, the adjusted odds ratio being 0.49 (95% CI 0.27-0.88) for the highest versus lowest quartile of intake.
