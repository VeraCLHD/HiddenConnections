Combinations of these compounds at the lower dose were also investigated. All compounds tested dose-dependently reduced mean mRNA(arom) compared with controls. Apigenin was the most potent inhibitor with significant inhibition of mRNA(arom) seen at both 10 microM and 100 nM, whilst other flavonoids (except biochanin A) only induced significant inhibition (p<or=0.05) at the higher dose.
