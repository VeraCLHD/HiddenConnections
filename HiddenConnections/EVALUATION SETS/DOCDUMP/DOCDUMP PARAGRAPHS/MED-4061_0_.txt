Abstract A high intake of whole grain foods is associated with reduced risk of colon cancer, but the mechanism underlying this protection has yet to be elucidated. Chronic inflammation and associated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in the colon epithelium are causally related to epithelial carcinogenesis, proliferation, and tumor growth. We examined the effect of avenanthramides (Avns), unique polyphenols from oats with anti-inflammatory properties, on COX-2 expression in macrophages, colon cancer cell lines, and on proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines.
