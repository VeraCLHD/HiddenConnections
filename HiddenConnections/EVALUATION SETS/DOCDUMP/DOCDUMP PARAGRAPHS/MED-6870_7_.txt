RESULTS: Subjects with GD had a higher prevalence of YOP IgA (49%vs. 34%, P = 0.054) and YPO IgG (51%vs. 35%, P = 0.043) than the external controls. The frequency of chronic YE infection, reflected by the presence of both IgA and IgG YOP antibodies, was also higher among cases than controls (49%vs. 33%, P = 0.042). Similar results were found in twin pairs discordant for GD.
