Statistically, the differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals were modest in light of the multiple tests performed. CONCLUSIONS This study strengthens the plausibility that in humans, Ad36 increases adiposity and attenuates deterioration of glycemic control. Panoptically, the study raises the possibility that certain infections may modulate obesity or diabetes risk.
