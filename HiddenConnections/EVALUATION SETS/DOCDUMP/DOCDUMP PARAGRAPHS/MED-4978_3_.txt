The groups received either 10 g/d BSP (n=27), 5 g/d BSP (n=29) or placebo (n=25). Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were measured at baseline and at 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: In all, 63 patients in three groups were included in the analysis: 10 g/d BSP (n=21), 5 g/d (n=22) and placebo (n=20).
