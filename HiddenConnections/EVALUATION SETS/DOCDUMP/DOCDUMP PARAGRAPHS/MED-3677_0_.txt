Abstract The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is increasing dramatically as a result of the obesity epidemic, and poses a major health and socio-economic burden. Type 2 diabetes develops in individuals who fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing pancreatic insulin secretion. This insulin deficiency results from pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and death.
