This was attributed to a sharp reduction in use of ezetimibe in combination with statin, without corresponding increases in intensive statin monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of patients admitted with ACS, most of the eligible patients were not discharged on LLT. These data suggest the need for better implementation of guideline-recommended intensive statin therapy in patients with ACS.
