The aim of this study was to do a comprehensive investigation of the components of one-carbon metabolism in relation to prostate cancer risk. A panel of seven circulating B vitamins and related metabolites was selected, most of which have not been studied before. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed plasma concentrations of betaine, choline, cysteine, methionine, methylmalonic acid (MMA), vitamin B2, and vitamin B6 in 561 cases and 1,034 controls matched for age and recruitment date, nested within the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort.
