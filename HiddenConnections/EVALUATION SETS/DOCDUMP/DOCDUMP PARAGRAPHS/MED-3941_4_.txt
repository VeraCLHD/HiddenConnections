Dietary intake was assessed using a valid self-administered diet-history questionnaire, and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale with 2 cut-off points: 11 (mild and severe) and 14 (severe) or use of anti-depressive agents. RESULTS: The prevalence of mild and severe and severe depressive symptoms was 34.9% and 20.2%, respectively. After adjustments for potentially confounding factors, the odds ratios of having mild and severe depressive symptoms by increasing levels of tomatoes/tomato products were 1.00, 0.54, and 0.48 (p for trend <0.01).
