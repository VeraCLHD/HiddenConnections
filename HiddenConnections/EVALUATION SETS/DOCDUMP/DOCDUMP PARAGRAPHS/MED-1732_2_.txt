DATA SOURCES: March 2007 search of MEDLINE via PubMed using the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy to identify reports of RCTs published in December 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they were parallel-group RCTs with a clearly identified primary outcome showing statistically nonsignificant results (ie, P > or = .05). DATA EXTRACTION: Two readers appraised each selected article using a pretested, standardized data abstraction form developed in a pilot test.
