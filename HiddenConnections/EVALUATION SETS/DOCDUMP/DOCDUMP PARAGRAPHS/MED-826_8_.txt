The BCdC positively correlated with age of subjects (r = 0.144; P = .025) and offal daily intake in nonsmokers (r = 0.393; P < .001). The intake of Ca was negatively correlated (r = -0.281; P = .001) with the BCdC in females. The multiple linear regression analysis showed smoking > consumption of offal > body mass index â‰ˆ age as the most important risk factors for the BCdC in the selected population.
