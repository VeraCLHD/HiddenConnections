Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in human cancers. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the major antioxidant in the mitochondria, catalysing the dismutation of superoxide radicals to form hydrogen peroxide. Since the identification of a well-characterised functional polymorphism, Val-9Ala of MnSOD, a number of molecular epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between Val-9Ala and cancer risk.
