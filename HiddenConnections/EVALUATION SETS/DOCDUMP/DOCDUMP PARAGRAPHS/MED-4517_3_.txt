The levels of all chemicals in the chlorobenzene, pesticide and other halogenated organic groups were determined to be below their detection limits in all samples. National averages were computed for 11 chemicals or chemical groups found above the detection limits. The national average CDD/CDF and PCB TEQ concentrations were 14.30 and 8.64 pg/l, respectively, for a total of 22.94 pg/l.
