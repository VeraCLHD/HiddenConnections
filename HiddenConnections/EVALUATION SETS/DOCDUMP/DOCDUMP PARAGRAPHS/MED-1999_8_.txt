Specific genetic background may also accentuate this visceral fat accumulation in some individuals exposed to stress. Alternatively, obesity could also be a source of stress promoting the visceral fat accumulation since visceral fat is able to release cytokines which stimulate the HPA axis. Even if the available literature does not permit to establish clearly which comes first, it suggests that visceral obesity could represent a non optimal physiological adaptation to stress.
