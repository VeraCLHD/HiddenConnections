Abstract Overall it is clear that bariatric surgical intervention in appropriately selected adolescents is effective at both adequate weight loss and resolution of weight related co-morbidities in the short and medium term. Long-term results are being conducted currently to assess durability of bariatric surgical interventions. We believe that adolescents undergoing bariatric evaluation have unique needs and until more long-term data are available, the indications for surgery should be stricter than those used in adults.
