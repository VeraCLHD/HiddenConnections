Kappa between herd-level status based on pig and pooled samples ranged between 0.51 and 0.68 for biotype 1A and bioserotype 4, O:3, respectively. For 4, O:3, a significant bias in discordant pairs was detected, indicating that pig samples were more sensitive than pooled samples in declaring a herd as positive. Farms tended to be repeatedly positive with the same bioserotype, but positive study farms did not cluster spatially (suggesting lack of between herd transmission and lack of a common geographic risk factor).
