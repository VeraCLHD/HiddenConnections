Cancer patients are significantly depleted of ascorbic acid, and in our opinion this demonstrable biochemical characteristic indicates a substantially increased requirement and utilization of this substance to potentiate these various host resistance factors.

Their progress is compared to that of 1000 similar patients treated identically, but who received no supplemental ascorbate.
