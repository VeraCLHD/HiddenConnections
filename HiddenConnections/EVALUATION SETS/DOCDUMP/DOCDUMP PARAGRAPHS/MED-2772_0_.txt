Abstract In this study, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association of major dietary patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia taking account of blood lipids in Chinese adults. 187 cases with confirmed asymptomatic hyperuricemia and 187 controls were frequency matched on age, gender and area of residence. We conducted factor analysis using dietary information from a validated food frequency questionnaire to derive dietary patterns.
