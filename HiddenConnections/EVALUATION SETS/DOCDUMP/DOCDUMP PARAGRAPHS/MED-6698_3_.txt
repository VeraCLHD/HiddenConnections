Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and corticosteroid requirements were compared. RESULTS: One patient in each group was withdrawn. In the trial group there was a progressive decrease in CDAI from entry (392 +/- 25) to month 4 (145 +/- 47) (P = 0.002 vs control group) and seven patients were in remission (CDAI <150).
