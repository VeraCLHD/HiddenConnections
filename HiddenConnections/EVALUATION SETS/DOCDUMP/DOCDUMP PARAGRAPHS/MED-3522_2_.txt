Much of the early work on the thermic effect was confined to the type and amount of food, notably the macronutrients--proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Later, it was shown that certain minor constituents of the diet such as caffeine and associated methylxanthines (Zahorska-Markrewicz, 1980; Jung et al., 1981) in tea and coffee could also have a profound effect on metabolic rate. The consumption of alcohol was also shown to increase metabolic rate (Rosenberg & Durnin, 1978).
