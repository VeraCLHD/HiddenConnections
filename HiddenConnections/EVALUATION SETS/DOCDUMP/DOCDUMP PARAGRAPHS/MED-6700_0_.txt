Abstract OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: Western diets regularly expose the gastrointestinal tract (GI) to large quantities ( > 10(12)/day) of man-made, submicron-sized, particles derived from food additives and excipients. These are taken up by M cells, accumulate in gut macrophages, and may influence the aetiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). MATERIALS: We investigated the effects of common dietary microparticles on the function of macrophages from healthy donors or active Crohn's disease (CD) patients.
