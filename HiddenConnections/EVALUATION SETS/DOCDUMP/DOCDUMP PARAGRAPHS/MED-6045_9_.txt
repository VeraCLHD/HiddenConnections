Subjects with a history of diabetes had an OR of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.6-4.3) for HCC compared with nondiabetic subjects. A synergistic interaction on HCC risk was observed between heavy alcohol consumption and diabetes (OR = 4.2; 95% CI, 2.6-5.8), heavy alcohol consumption and viral hepatitis (OR = 5.5; 95% CI, 3.9-7.0), or between diabetes and viral hepatitis (OR = 4.8; 95% CI, 2.7-6.9). CONCLUSIONS: Heavy alcohol consumption, diabetes, and viral hepatitis were found to exert independent and synergistic effects on risk of HCC in U.S. blacks and whites.
