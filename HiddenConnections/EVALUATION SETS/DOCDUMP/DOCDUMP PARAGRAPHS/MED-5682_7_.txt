RESULTS: A significant decrease (p < 0.0002) of serum B-12 concentrations in the whole studied group was noted after 60 months of vegan diet. However, observed changes were in fact limited to the subgroup consuming exclusively natural products (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Transition from omnivore to vegan diet is associated with the risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency.
