Curcumin-induced apoptosis mainly involves the activation of caspase-3 and mitochondria-mediated pathway in various cancer cells of different tissue origin. In the present study, the induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity by curcumin in colon cancer colo 205 cells was investigated by using flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that curcumin induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis dose- and time-depedently.
