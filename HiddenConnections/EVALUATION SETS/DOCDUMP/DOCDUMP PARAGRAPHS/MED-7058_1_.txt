Recent advances have indicated that the liver-derived peptide hepcidin plays a central role in this process by repressing iron release from intestinal enterocytes, macrophages and other body cells. When iron requirements are increased, hepcidin levels decline and more iron enters the plasma. It has been proposed that the level of circulating diferric transferrin, which reflects tissue iron levels, acts as a signal to alter hepcidin expression.
