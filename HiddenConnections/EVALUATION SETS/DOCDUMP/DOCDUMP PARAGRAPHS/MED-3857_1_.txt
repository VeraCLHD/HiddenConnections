We found that NF-kappaB was constitutively active in all human MM cell lines examined and that curcumin, a chemopreventive agent, down-regulated NF-kappaB in all cell lines as indicated by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay and prevented the nuclear retention of p65 as shown by immunocytochemistry. All MM cell lines showed consitutively active IkappaB kinase (IKK) and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. Curcumin suppressed the constitutive IkappaBalpha phosphorylation through the inhibition of IKK activity.
