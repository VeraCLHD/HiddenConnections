Platelets are emerging as important mediators of inflammation and provide important signals to mediate phenotype of other blood and vascular cells. The important role of platelets in arterial thrombosis and the onset of acute myocardial infarction after atherosclerotic plaque rupture make inhibition of platelet aggregation a critical step in preventing thrombotic events associated with stroke, heart attack, and peripheral arterial thrombosis. However, the use of platelet inhibitors for thrombosis prevention must seek a delicate balance between inhibiting platelet activation and an associated increased bleeding risk.
