RESULTS: Average daily total EE and number of steps taken was 4173 ± 848 kcal/d (range, 3332 to 4838 kcal/d) and 26,232 ± 7210 steps/d (range, 11,788 to 34,979 steps/d), respectively. On average, subjects spent approximately 7.7 h/d performing physical activity (>3.0 METS). Of this, subjects spent 399 ± 107, 61 ± 77, and 3 ± 10 min/d at moderate, vigorous, and very vigorous intensity levels, respectively, corresponding to 88%, 11%, and 1% of total physical activity time.
