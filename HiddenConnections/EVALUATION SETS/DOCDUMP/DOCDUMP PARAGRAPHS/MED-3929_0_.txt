Abstract We investigated the effect of resistant starch (RS) on markers of colonic protein metabolism. Eleven subjects participated in a randomized crossover study in which they consumed either high-RS (39 +/- 3 g/d, -chi +/- SEM) or low-RS (5 +/- 0.4 g/d) diets for 3 wk. All other macronutrients were kept constant.
