A similar trend was also observed among women, which however, did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Coffee modulates the effect of ethanol on serum GGT activities in a dose- and gender-dependent manner. These observations should be implicated in studies on the possible hepatoprotective effects of coffee in alcohol consumers.
