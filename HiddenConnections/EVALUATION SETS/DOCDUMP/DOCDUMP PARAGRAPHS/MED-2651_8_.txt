In human subjects, ingestion of green and black tea led to significant increases in FMD: from 5.4 (sd 2.3) to 10.2 (sd 3) % (baseline-adjusted difference (BAD) for 2 h of FMD, green tea v. water: 5.0 (95 % CI 3.0, 7.0) %; P < 0.001) and from 5 (sd 2.6) to 9.1 (sd 3.6) % (BAD for 2 h of FMD, black tea v. water: 4.4 (95 % CI 2.3, 6.5) %; P < 0.001), respectively. The increase in FMD was not significantly different between the two tea preparations (BAD for 2 h of FMD, green tea v. black tea: 0.66 (95 % CI - 0.76, 2.09) %; P = 0.36). NMD did not vary between any of the groups.
