Electric light has benefits but there are also a few detriments. These are (1) loss of the night sky, (2) wasted energy, (3) harm to animal and plant life, (4) and perhaps increases in some severe human maladies such as cancers of breast and prostate. The science on phototransduction for the circadian system and on clock gene function is evolving rapidly, and it provides a rationale for the idea that circadian disruption from light at night could cause disease.
