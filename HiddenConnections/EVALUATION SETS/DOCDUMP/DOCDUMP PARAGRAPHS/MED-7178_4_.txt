We propose that GBS illustrates competing determinants of the immune system's decision about whether to mount a response, and that in unlucky affected individuals, co-presentation of cross-reactive antigens with danger signals activating pattern-recognition receptors overcomes normal self-recognition such that a primary response is initiated that attacks the nerve. Then, in most cases of GBS, the response rapidly turns off, and second attacks rarely occur. This suggests active restoration of tolerance, and specific privileged site attributes of nerve and declining danger signals as the trigger wanes may contribute to this restoration.
