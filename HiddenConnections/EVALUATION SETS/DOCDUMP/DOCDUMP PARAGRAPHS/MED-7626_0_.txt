Abstract Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but flavonols were well retained.
