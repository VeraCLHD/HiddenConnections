Body composition was calculated according to quartile of potential renal acid load and adjusted for age, physical activity, misreporting and smoking habit (FFM, FFMI also for fat mass) and additionally with percentage protein. RESULTS: Fat-free mass was positively associated with a more alkalinogenic dietary load (comparing quartile 1 vs 4: FFM 0.79 kg P < 0.001, FFM% 1.06 % <0.001, FFMI 0.24 kg/m² P = 0.002), and with the ratio of fruits and vegetables to potential acidogenic foods. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a small but significant positive association between a more alkaline diet and muscle mass indexes in healthy women that was independent of age, physical activity and protein intake equating to a scale of effect between a fifth and one half of the observed relationship with 10 years of age.
