DESIGN: Twenty-three younger (age: 21-46 y; 11 men, 12 women) and 19 older (age: 63-81 y; 8 men, 11 women) persons completed three 18-d trials with protein intakes of 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 g protein x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1). Nitrogen balance was determined by using data from total nitrogen analyses of duplicate food composites and complete urine and feces collections from days 14 to 17 of each trial. Each subject's protein requirement was estimated by using linear regression of protein intake and nitrogen balance data from all 3 trials and inverse prediction.
