We report a significant reduction of SIRT1 (mRNA: −29%; protein: −45%) in the parietal cortex of AD patients, but not in the cerebellum. Further analyses in a second cohort of 36 subjects confirmed that cortical SIRT1 was decreased in the cortex of AD patients but not in individuals with mild cognitive impairment. SIRT1 mRNA and its translated protein correlated negatively with the duration of symptoms (mRNA: r2 = −0.367; protein: r2 = −0.326) and the accumulation of paired helical filament tau (mRNA: r2 = −0.230; protein: r2 = −0.119), but weakly with insoluble amyloid-β(Aβ42 (mRNA: r2 = −0.090; protein: r2 = −0.072).
