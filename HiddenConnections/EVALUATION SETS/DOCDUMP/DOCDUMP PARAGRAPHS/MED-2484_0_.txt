Abstract Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is believed to contribute to atherosclerosis in part by being taken up into macrophages via scavenger receptors, thus accounting for foam cells. Balsamic vinegar is made from grapes and generally consumed in the Mediterranean region. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of balsamic vinegar on LDL oxidation and foam cell formation.
