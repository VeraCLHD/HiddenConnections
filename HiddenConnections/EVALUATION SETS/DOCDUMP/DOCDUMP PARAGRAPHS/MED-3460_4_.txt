We determined the overall relative risk (RR) and confidence interval (CI) for the highest and lowest levels of coffee consumption. A dose-response analysis was performed to assess the risk of fractures based on the level of coffee consumption. RESULTS: We included 253,514 participants with 12,939 fracture cases from 9 cohort and 6 case-control studies.
