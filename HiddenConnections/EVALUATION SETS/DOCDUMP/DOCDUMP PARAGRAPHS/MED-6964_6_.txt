In this paper, it will be shown that just a slowing-down kinetics is predicted for cancer incidence by using a mathematical model of mortality kinetics recently proposed in the gerontologic field. The slowing of the increasing rate or even a decreasing trend of cancer incidence of an aging population is compatible with a continuously accelerating pace of loss of physiological capacity of the single subjects, as with advancing age there is a selection of individuals with better physiological functions.
