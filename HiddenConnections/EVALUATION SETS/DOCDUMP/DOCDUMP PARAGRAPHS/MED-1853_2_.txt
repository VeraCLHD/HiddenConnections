12 healthy volunteers consumed a controlled basal diet enriched with either amylomaize starch (55.2 +/- 3.5 g RS/d; high-RS diet) or available cornstarch (7.7 +/- 0.3 g RS/d; low-RS diet). Approximately 90% of the RS consumed disappeared during intestinal passage; increased fermentation was verified by elevated breath-hydrogen excretion. During the high-RS diet, fecal wet and dry weight increased 49% and 56%, respectively (P < or = 0.005), whereas stool water content did not change significantly.
