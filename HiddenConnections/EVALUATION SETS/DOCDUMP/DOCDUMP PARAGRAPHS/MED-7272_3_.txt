+)) decolorisation assay. The average TAA value of faeces was 26.6 (sd 10.2) mmol Trolox/kg wet faeces (range 7.5-50.5). The total amount of antioxidant equivalents excreted over 24 h, derived by multiplying the TAA by the amount of faeces passed over 24 h, was 3.24 (sd 1.51) mmol Trolox (range 0.92-5.82) and this was significantly correlated with the average 24 h intake of coffee red wine and particularly to the sum of coffee and red wine In conclusion, the faeces of healthy subjects show detectable capacity to scavenge radical cations, suggesting that antioxidant activity occurs in the colonic lumen.
