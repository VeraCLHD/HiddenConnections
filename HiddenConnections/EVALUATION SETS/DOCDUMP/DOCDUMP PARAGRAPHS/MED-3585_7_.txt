Those reporting hard stools also had a reduced odds (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55–1.02). There was no association between diverticulosis and straining (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.59–1.22) or incomplete BM (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.61–1.20). We found no association between dietary fiber intake and diverticulosis (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.71–1.30) in comparing the highest quartile to the lowest (mean intake 25 versus 8 g/day).
