Knockdown of either protein reduced cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in rat and human β-cells. DP5 induction depends on inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)–dependent c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and PKR–like ER kinase (PERK)–induced activating transcription factor (ATF3) binding to its promoter. PUMA expression is also PERK/ATF3-dependent, through tribbles 3 (TRB3)–regulated AKT inhibition and FoxO3a activation.
