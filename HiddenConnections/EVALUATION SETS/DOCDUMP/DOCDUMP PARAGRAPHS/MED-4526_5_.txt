In this group, men in the highest tertile of intake (0.82â€“2.43 servings/day) had 53.2% (95%CI 9.7, 75.7) lower sperm concentration than men in the lowest tertile of cheese intake (<0.43 servings/day). Conclusions Our findings suggest that low-fat dairy intake, particularly low-fat milk, is related to higher sperm concentration and progressive motility, while cheese intake to lower sperm concentration among past or current smokers.
