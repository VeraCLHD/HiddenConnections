Abstract The amount of nutrients that can be released from food products (i.e., nutrient in vitro bioaccessibility) is often studied as it is a starting point for investigating nutrient bioavailability, an indicator for the nutritional value of food products. However, the importance of mastication as a particle size reduction technique is poorly understood and is often neglected during in vitro procedures determining bioaccessibility. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to study the effect of mechanical breakdown on the Î²-carotene bioaccessibility of carrot samples, having different textural/structural characteristics (as a result of thermal processing).
