Flow-dependent vasoactivity decreased from 21 +/- 5% preprandially to 11 +/- 4%, 11 +/- 6%, and 10 +/- 3% at 2, 3, and 4 hours after the high-fat meal, respectively (all p <0.05 compared with low-fat meal data). No changes in lipoproteins or flow-mediated vasoactivity were observed after the low-fat meal. Fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol correlated inversely (r = -0.47, p = 0.04) with preprandial flow-mediated vasoactivity, but triglyceride level did not.
