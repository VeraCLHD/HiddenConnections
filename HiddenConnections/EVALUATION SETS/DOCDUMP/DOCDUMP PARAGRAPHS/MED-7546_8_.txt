Evidence from the results of our stratified analyses revealed that tea consumption ≥4 cups per day (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7–0.93) might play a role in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. However, no statistically significant association was observed for sex and the follow-up durations stratified between tea consumption and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis indicates that tea consumption ≥4 cups per day may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.
