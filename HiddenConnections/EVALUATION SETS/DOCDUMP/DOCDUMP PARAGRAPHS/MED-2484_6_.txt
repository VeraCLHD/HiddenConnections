Balsamic vinegar prolonged the LDL oxidation lag time and decreased lipid peroxide (LPO) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) in LDL particles. We next examined the effect of balsamic vinegar on foam cell formation. Oil red O staining showed that balsamic vinegar inhibited oxidized LDL-induced foam cell formation in THP-1 macrophages.
