METHODS: A total of 26,691 men aged 50-64 years participated in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study and provided information about diet and potential prostate cancer risk factors. During a median follow-up of 12.4 years, we identified 1,081 prostate cancer cases. Associations between whole-grain product intake and prostate cancer incidence were analyzed using Cox's regression model.
