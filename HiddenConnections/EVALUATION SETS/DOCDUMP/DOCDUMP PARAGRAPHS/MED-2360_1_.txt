We hypothesized that severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and rate-modulating drugs explain the HR-SCD relationship. Objective We evaluated the relationship between HR, severe LVSD, rate-affecting medications and SCD in the community, using a case-control approach. Methods From the ongoing Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study, SCD cases (n=378) aged ≥35 years and with EKG-documented resting HR, were compared to 378 age- and gender-matched control subjects with coronary artery disease (68±13 years, 69% male).
