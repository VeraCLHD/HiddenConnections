We excluded sensitization to other chicken nematodes by serologic methods. RESULTS: All 8 patients presented positive prick and challenges to A simplex. When we used serum from chickens fed with fishmeal as the antigen in blotting, patients 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 recognized a band of 16 kd, also obtained when using pools of fish-shellfish and A simplex larva.
