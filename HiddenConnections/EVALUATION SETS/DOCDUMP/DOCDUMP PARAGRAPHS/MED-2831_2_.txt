Methods and Results Phases I and II of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP) collected multiple 24-hour urine specimens among pre-hypertensive individuals. During extended post-trial surveillance, 193 cardiovascular events or CVD deaths occurred among 2275 participants not in a sodium reduction intervention with 10 (TOHP II) or 15 (TOHP I) years of post-trial follow-up. Median sodium excretion was 3630 mg/24hr, with 1.4% of the participants having intake <1500 mg/24hr and 10% <2300 mg/24hr, consistent with national levels.
