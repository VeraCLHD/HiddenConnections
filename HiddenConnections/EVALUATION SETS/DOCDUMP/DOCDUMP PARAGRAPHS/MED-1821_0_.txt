Abstract BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (R), as add-on therapy in symptomatic patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease (CAD), has been tested in randomized clinical studies. Aim of the study was to assess in a meta-analysis the effects of R on angina, nitroglycerin consumption, functional capacity, electrocardiographic signs of ischemia and hemodynamic parameters in patients with chronic CAD. METHODS: Randomized trials assessing the effects of R compared to control on exercise duration, time to onset of angina, time to 1mm ST-segment depression, weekly nitroglycerin consumption and weekly angina frequency were included in the analysis.
