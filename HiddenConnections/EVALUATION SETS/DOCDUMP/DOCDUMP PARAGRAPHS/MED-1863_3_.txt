Mean ATNC excretion during the high-meat period was 114 micrograms/day, three times that during the low-meat period of 35 micrograms/day (p = 0.02); ammonia excretion was twice that during the low-meat period: 2.9 vs. 1.4 mmol/day (p = 0.03). The fecal ATNC were dissolved in the fecal water, and 45% had a molecular weight < 3,000. The addition of readily fermentable resistant starch to the high-meat diet significantly increased stool output from 118 to 153 g/day and decreased fecal pH from 7.2 to 6.6 but had no significant effect on fecal ATNC (151 micrograms/day), ammonia (3.7 mmol/day), whole gut transit time, urinary nitrate, or plasma urea.
