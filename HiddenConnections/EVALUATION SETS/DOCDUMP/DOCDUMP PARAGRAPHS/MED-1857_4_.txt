The primary endpoint was polyp number in the rectum and sigmoid colon (at the end of intervention), and the major secondary endpoint was size of the largest polyp. A total of 206 randomized FAP patients commenced intervention, of whom 133 had at least 1 follow-up endoscopy and so were included in the primary analysis. Neither intervention significantly reduced polyp count in the rectum and sigmoid colon: aspirin relative risk (RR) = 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54–1.10; versus non-aspirin arms); RS RR = 1.05 (95% CI, 0.73–1.49; versus non-RS arms).
