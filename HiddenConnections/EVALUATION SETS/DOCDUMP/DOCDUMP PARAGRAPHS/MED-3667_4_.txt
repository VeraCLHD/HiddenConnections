INTERVENTIONS: Printed educational materials designed to encourage patients to quit smoking, eat less fat, and increase physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recall, rating, and use of the educational materials; changes in smoking behavior, dietary fat consumption, and physical activity. RESULTS: Patients who received physician advice to quit smoking, eat less fat, or get more exercise prior to receiving intervention materials on the same topic were more likely to remember the materials, show them to others, and perceive the materials as applying to them specifically.
