Information on management, biosecurity measures and housing conditions was collected in 20 flocks suffering from the disease and in 20 clinically healthy control flocks. The data were processed using multiple logistic regression. The statistical analysis demonstrated that an increase in the distance to the nearest poultry farm by 1 km was associated with a six-fold decreased risk of an outbreak of colibacillosis (odds ratio=0.16).
