In this review, the role of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) as a non-invasive method to assess endothelial function is discussed. Technical modifications and development of analysis software have significantly improved the variability of the method. Following a strict standardized protocol enables reproducible measurements to be achieved and export of the technique from specialized laboratories to population studies and multicentre settings.
