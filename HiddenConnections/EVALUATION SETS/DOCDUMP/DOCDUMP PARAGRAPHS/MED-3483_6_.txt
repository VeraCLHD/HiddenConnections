The endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response was greater 4 h after the ingestion of the MUFA-rich diet than after the SFA or ALA low-fat diets (P = 0.031). The 4 h postprandial plasma sVCAM-1 levels were lower after the MUFA meals than after the ALA low-fat diet (P = 0.043). The bioavailability of NOx was higher following the MUFA diet than after the SFA and ALA low-fat diets (P = 0.027).
