Abstract The description of an 115 year old woman without dementia or Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is remarkable, but fits well with previous accounts of aging and AD. Several similar non-demented cases aged 85 to 105 years have been reported previously, who had neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe, but no deposition of amyloid plaques. Together with observations on other aging and very mild AD cases, these can be related to a model of aging and AD.
