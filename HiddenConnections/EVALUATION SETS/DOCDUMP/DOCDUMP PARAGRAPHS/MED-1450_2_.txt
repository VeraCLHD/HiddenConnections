A common assumption that increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption leads per se to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is not supported by in vitro and in vivo data. The specific contributions of other systems (xanthine oxidase, inflammation, haem protein auto-oxidation) are poorly characterised. It has been demonstrated that ROS have the capacity to contribute to the development of muscle fatigue in situ, but there is still a lack of convincing direct evidence that ROS impair exercise performance in vivo in humans.
