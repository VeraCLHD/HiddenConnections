OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy ofa lifestyle program consisting of a modified elimination diet and a supplemental medical food on clinical symptoms of FM assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), FibroQuest Symptoms Survey (FibroQuest), Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ), metallothionein mRNA expression, and urinary toxic element excretion. METHODS: Eight women (aged 48-74 years) were enrolled in an 8-week pilot trial employing a sequential design.
