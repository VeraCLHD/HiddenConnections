To address this gap, the following study reports on the carriage of MRSA and C. difficile on pigs from birth through to the end of processing. C. difficile was isolated from 28 (93%) of 30 pigs at 1 day of age, but prevalence declined sharply to 1 of 26 by market age (188 days). MRSA prevalence peaked at 74 days of age, with 19 (68%) of 28 pigs testing positive, but declined to 3 of 26 at 150 days of age, with no pig being detected as positive at market age.
