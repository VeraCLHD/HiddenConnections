Abstract Fatty foods have been identified as precipitating factors in symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER). A fat meal has also been found to decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) in normal subjects. We used the ambulatory 24-h pH monitor to assess esophageal acid exposure in 10 normal subjects and 10 GER patients following low and high fat meals eaten in two body positions.
