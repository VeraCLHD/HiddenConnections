Abstract The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. During intracellular transport APP undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages that lead to the release either of an amyloidogenic fragment called β-amyloid (Aβ) or of a nonamyloidogenic secreted form consisting of the ectodomain of APP (APPsec). It is Aβ that accumulates in the brain lesions that are thought to cause the disease.
