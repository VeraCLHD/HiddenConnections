Here, we present a pilot study examining the efficacy of the copper-chelating agent d-penicillamine in reducing oxidative stress in AD patients. DESIGN: Serum levels of copper sampled in AD patients and healthy controls indicate a copper homeostasis imbalance in AD. On this basis, 34 AD patients were enrolled in a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the copper d-penicillamine-chelating agent.
