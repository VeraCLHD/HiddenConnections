Slow coronary flow (SCF) was defined as a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count greater than 27/frame. Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Carotid intima-media thickness, an indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis, was measured using B-mode ultrasonography.
