Results Exercise decreased spirometry only in children with asthma, but increased (p<0.001) most types of leucocytes (eg lymphocytes (controls, mean (SD) 1210 (208) cells/μl; children with asthma, 1119 (147) cells/μl) and eosinophils (controls, 104 (22) cells/μl; children with asthma, 88 (20) cells/μl)) to the same degree in both groups. Similarly, exercise increased T helper cells (controls, 248 (60) cells/μl; children with asthma, 232 (53) cells/μl) and most other lymphocyte subtypes tested. By contrast, although basophils (16 (5) cells/μl) and CD4+ CD45RO+ RA+ lymphocytes (19 (4) cells/μl) increased in controls, no increase in these cell types was found in children with asthma.
