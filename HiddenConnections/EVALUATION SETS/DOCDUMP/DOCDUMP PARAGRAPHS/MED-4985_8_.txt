The OR is 4.54 (95%CI=2.96-6.95) and 6.45 (95%CI=4.38-9.50) for more than 30 years of cigarette-only and bidi-only smoking, respectively, and 6.87 (95%CI=4.62-10.2) and 10.7 (95%CI=5.82-19.6) for more than 12 weighted cumulative cigarette-only and bidi-only consumption, respectively. The lung cancer risk of former cigarette smokers drops down more quickly after quitting smoking compared to former bidi smokers. There is no evidence for the effect of chewing and lung cancer risk nor clear evidence of an effect of overall alcohol drinking among never-smokers, although Indian alcohol drinking seemed to remain associated with lung cancer risk under limited power (OR=2.67, 95%CI=1.02-7.02).
