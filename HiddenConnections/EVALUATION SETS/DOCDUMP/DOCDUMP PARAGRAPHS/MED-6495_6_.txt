Increasing alcohol consumption was associated with increased breast cancer risk that was statistically significant at levels as low as 5.0-9.9 gm/day, equivalent to 3-6 drinks/week (RR 1.15 (95% CI 1.06-1.24) 332 cases/100,000 person-years). After controlling for cumulative alcohol intake, binge drinking, but not frequency of drinking, was associated with breast cancer risk. Alcohol intake both earlier and later in adult life was independently associated with risk.
