We evaluated the contribution of caloric restriction versus surgically induced changes to glucose homeostasis in the immediate postoperative period. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients with type 2 diabetes planning to undergo RYGB participated in a prospective two-period study (each period involved a 10-day inpatient stay, and periods were separated by a minimum of 6 weeks of wash-out) in which patients served as their own controls. The presurgery period consisted of diet alone.
