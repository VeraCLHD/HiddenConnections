METHODS: Seventy-six men and women aged 18 to 50 years with a body mass index of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2) consumed either 480 mL CGJ, 480 mL substitute (polyphenol-free) grape-flavored drink (SGD), or no beverage (NTG) daily for 12 weeks. Anthropometric indices were measured biweekly, dietary intake and appetite were assessed 4 times during the study, and plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity, lipids, and oral glucose tolerance were assessed at baseline and week 12. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the SGD group reported a reduction in fullness (p < 0.005) and gained 1.6 kg (p < 0.05).
