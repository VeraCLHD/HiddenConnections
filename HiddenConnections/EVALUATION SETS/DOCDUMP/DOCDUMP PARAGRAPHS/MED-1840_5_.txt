We also examined CHIS data on trends in screening mammography. Results In 2001, there were large regional differences in EPHT use and breast cancer incidence. From 2001 to 2004, incidence declined by 8.8% in the counties with the smallest EPHT reductions, by 13.9% in those with intermediate reductions, and by 22.6% in counties with the largest EPHT reductions.
