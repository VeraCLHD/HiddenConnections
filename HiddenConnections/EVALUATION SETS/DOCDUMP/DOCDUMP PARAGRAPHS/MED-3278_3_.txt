Results Using a quantitative analysis of atherosclerosis in the aorta, heart and intracranial vessels, we found no relationship between the degree of atherosclerosis in any of these systems and the degree of Alzheimerâ€™s type brain pathology. However, we found that the presence of intracranial but not coronary or aortic atherosclerosis significantly increased the odds of dementia, independent of cerebral infarction. Given the large number of individuals with intracranial atherosclerosis in this cohort (136/200), the population attributable risk of dementia related to intracranial atherosclerosis (independent of infarction) is substantial and potentially reversible.
