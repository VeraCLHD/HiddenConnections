Methods and results A critical review of the published literature on tea intake and risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers was conducted. In meta-analyses, we report inverse associations for green tea intake and risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.80), and for green tea and risk of endometrial cancer (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98). There was no association for black tea and ovarian cancer risk (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.02) and a positive association with endometrial cancer risk (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.38).
