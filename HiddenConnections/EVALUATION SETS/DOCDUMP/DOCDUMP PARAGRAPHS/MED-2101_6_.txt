RESULTS: Mean values for malondialdehyde were significantly elevated (P<0.001) in test groups, indicating enhanced osteoclastic activity. Significantly depressed (P<0.001) activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase reinforced hyperoxidant stress. Mean values of glutathione reductase remained unaltered.
