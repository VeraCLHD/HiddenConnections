RESULTS: Compared with the saturated fat diet, flow-mediated dilatation increased during the Mediterranean diet but not during the NCEP-1 diet. In addition, levels of plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and P-selectin decreased during the NCEP-1 and Mediterranean diets. CONCLUSION: In hypercholesterolemic men, diets low in fat (especially saturated fat) and diets rich in monounsaturated fats improve endothelial function.
