Measurements included time to complete 10-km TT, power output during 10-km TT, blood glucose levels and respiratory exchange ratio during glycogen depletion period, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), 'flow' questionnaire responses, and a hedonic (i.e., pleasantness) sensory acceptance test. There were no significant differences in endurance performance for TT time (SDRs vs. SJBs, 17.3 ± 0.4 vs. 17.3 ± 0.4 seconds) or power (229.3 ± 13.0 vs. 232.0 ± 13.6 W), resting blood glucose levels (5.8 ± 04 mmol·L(-1) for SDRs and 5.4 ± 0.2 mmol·L(-1) for SJBs), RPE, or flow experiences between SDR and SJB trials. However, the mean sensory acceptance scores were significantly higher for the SDRs compared to the SJBs (50.7 ± 1.7 vs. 44.3 ± 2.7).
