There was a marked decrease in endothelium-dependent dilation after the WHF meal compared to the LF meal (8.6 +/- 2.2% vs. -0.8 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.006). There was also a marked decrease in endothelium-dependent dilation after the LHF meal compared to the LF meal (7.7 +/- 2.1% vs. -0.8 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.001). When comparing between the two HF meals, the change in endothelium-dependent dilation was not significant (7.7 vs. 8.6%, P = 0.678).
