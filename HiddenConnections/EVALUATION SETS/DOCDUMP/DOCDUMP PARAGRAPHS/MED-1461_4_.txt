Consumption of orange juice by the experimental group was associated with increased dietary intake of vitamin C and folate by 126% and 61% respectively. Serum LDL-C decreased 15% (P<0.05) and HDL-C increased 18% (P<0.05) in the experimental group, but no significant change was observed in the control group. Both groups improved the anaerobic threshold by 20% (P<0.05), but blood lactate concentration decreased 27% in the experimental group compared to the 17% control group, suggesting that experimental group has less muscle fatigue and better response to training.
