RESULTS: There were 3268 incident cancers after a mean follow-up of 11.4 y. Dietary NDMA intake was significantly associated with increased cancer risk in men and women [hazard ratio (HR): 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.27; P for trend = 0.03] and in men (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.44; P for trend = 0.005) when the highest quartile was compared with the lowest quartile in age- and sex-adjusted analyses but not in multivariate analyses (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.24; HR for men: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.40; P for trend â‰¥ 0.05). When continuously analyzed, NDMA was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.28), specifically of rectal cancer (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.84) per 1-SD increase after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, cigarette smoking status, alcohol intake, energy intake, physical activity, education, and menopausal status (in women). The endogenous NOC index and dietary nitrite were not significantly associated with cancer risk.
