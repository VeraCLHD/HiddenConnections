MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) for assessing the key dimensions of female sexual function. RESULTS: The two groups were well matched for age and smoking prevalence. Compared with women of the control group, women with hyperlipidemia had reduced mean global FSFI score (22.8 +/- 6.8 vs. 29.4 +/- 4.9, P < 0.001).
