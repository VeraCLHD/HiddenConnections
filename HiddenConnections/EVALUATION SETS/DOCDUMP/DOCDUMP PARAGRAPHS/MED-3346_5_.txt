In the chronic intervention study FVPD consumption was found to significantly increase dietary carotenoids (P=0.001) and vitamin C (P=0.003). Plasma carotenoids were increased (P=0.001), but the increase in plasma vitamin C was not significant. There were no significant effects on oxidative stress, antioxidant status and other CVD risk factors.
