Third, statin therapy decreases other important downstream products, such as coenzyme Q10, farnesyl pyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and dolichol; their depletion leads to reduced intracellular signaling. Other possible mechanisms implicated in the effect of statins on new-onset diabetes are: statin interference with intracellular insulin signal transduction pathways via inhibition of necessary phosphorylation events and reduction of small GTPase action; inhibition of adipocyte differentiation leading to decreased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein which are important pathways for glucose homeostasis; decreased leptin causing inhibition of Î²-cells proliferation and insulin secretion; and diminished adiponectin levels. Given that the magnitude of the risk of new-onset diabetes following statin use remains to be fully clarified and the well-established beneficial effect of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk, statins remain the first-choice treatment for prevention of CVD.
