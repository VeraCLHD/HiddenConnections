From day 14 p.i. antibody titres increased to 1:80 to 1:20 480. Between days 14 and 28 p.i. (end of the experiment), antibody titres decreased in 14 ducks, remained the same in seven ducks, and continued to increase in three ducks. Bioassay in mice revealed T. gondii in the breast and leg muscles and the heart (100%, n=47), brain (91%, n=22), liver (54%, n=13) and stomach (46%, n=24).
