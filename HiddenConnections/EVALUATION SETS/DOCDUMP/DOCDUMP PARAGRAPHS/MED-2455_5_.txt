Reporting frequency for adverse events did not vary significantly by group during the trial; however, 50-56% of PCK and VIN participants reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event at week 6 as compared to 11% of REF participants (P = .110). Urinary pH was significantly reduced in VIN participants at week 12 as compared to the other groups (-9% vs. +3% and +2% for the PCK and REF groups, respectively, P = .023). At week 6 there was a tendency for aspartate aminotransferase concentrations to increase in the VIN group as compared to the other groups (+17% vs. +8% and -8% for VIN, PCK, and REF, respectively; P = .090).
