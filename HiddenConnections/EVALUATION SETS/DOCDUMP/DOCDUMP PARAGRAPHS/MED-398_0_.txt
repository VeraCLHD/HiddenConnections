Abstract BACKGROUND: Aqueous extracts from tomatoes display a range of antiplatelet activities in vitro. We previously showed that the active components also alter ex vivo platelet function in persons with a high response to ADP agonist. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the suitability of a tomato extract for use as a dietary supplement to prevent platelet activation.
