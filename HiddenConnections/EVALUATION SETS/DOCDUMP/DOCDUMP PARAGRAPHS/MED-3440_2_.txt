Post-LASIK tear dysfunction syndrome or dry eye is a term used to describe a spectrum of disease encompassing transient or persistent post-operative neurotrophic disease, tear instability, true aqueous tear deficiency, and neuropathic pain states. Neural changes in the cornea and neuropathic causes of ocular surface discomfort may play a separate or synergistic role in the development of symptoms in some patients. Most cases of early post-operative dry eye symptoms resolve with appropriate management, which includes optimizing ocular surface health before and after surgery.
