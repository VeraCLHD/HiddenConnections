Abstract BACKGROUND: It is well documented that renal transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing skin cancers, in particular squamous cell carcinomas. Less extensively reviewed in the literature is the increased incidence of malignant melanoma. We have reviewed 10 patients in the Oxford renal transplant population who developed 12 melanomas following transplantation.
