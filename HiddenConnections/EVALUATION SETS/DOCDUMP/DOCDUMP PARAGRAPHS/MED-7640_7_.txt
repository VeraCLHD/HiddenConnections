Two water-soluble vitamins, folic acid and niacin, can also have significant toxicities and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our recommendation is that vitamins A, E, D, folic acid, and niacin should be categorized as over-the-counter medications. Labeling of vitamins, especially those intended for children and other vulnerable groups, should include information on possible toxicities, dosing, recommended upper intake limits, and concurrent use with other products.
