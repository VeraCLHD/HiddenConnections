Carotenoids (beta-carotene, lycopene, alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin) were measured by HPLC. RESULTS: Despite similar dietary intake, whole blood levels of total carotenoids, lycopene, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene were significantly lower in asthma than controls. However, there were no differences in plasma or sputum carotenoid levels.
