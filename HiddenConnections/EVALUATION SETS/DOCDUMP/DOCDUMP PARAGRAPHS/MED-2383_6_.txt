On average, subjects spent approximately 7.7 h/d performing physical activity (>3.0 METS). Of this, subjects spent 399 ± 107, 61 ± 77, and 3 ± 10 min/d at moderate, vigorous, and very vigorous intensity levels, respectively, corresponding to 88%, 11%, and 1% of total physical activity time. During summit day, subjects climbed at an intensity equivalent to approximately 42% of their high altitude predicted maximal oxygen consumption at 5100 m).
