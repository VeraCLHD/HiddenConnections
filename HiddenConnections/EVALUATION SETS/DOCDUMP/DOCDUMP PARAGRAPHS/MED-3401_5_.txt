A comparison between preparations of raw spinach and of carrot, in which the intact cells have been largely broken, suggests that the membrane-bound carotenoids of spinach are more resistant to transfer than the crystalline carotenoids of carrot. Lowering the pH and pepsin treatment enhance the transfer from raw vegetables. The process of blanching and freezing spinach destroys the chloroplast ultrastructure and leads to (i) a substantial increase in transfer of the carotenoids to oil and (ii) an attenuation or reversal of the enhancement of transfer seen with reduced pH or with pepsin treatment.
