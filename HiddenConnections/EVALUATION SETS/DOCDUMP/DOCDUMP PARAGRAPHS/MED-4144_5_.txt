We considered participants adherent if they eliminated dairy, fish, and meat, and added oil. RESULTS: Of the 198 patients with CVD, 177 (89%) were adherent. Major cardiac events judged to be recurrent disease totaled one stroke in the adherent cardiovascular participantsâ€”a recurrent event rate of .6%, significantly less than reported by other studies of plant-based nutrition therapy.
