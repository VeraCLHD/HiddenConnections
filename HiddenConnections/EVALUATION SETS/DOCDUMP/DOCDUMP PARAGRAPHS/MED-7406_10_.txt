The relative juxtaposition of the hydrophobic amino-terminal region and the opening to the catalytic cleft shows why membrane anchoring is necessary for the lipophilic substrates to gain access to the active site. The molecular basis for the enzymeâ€™s androgenic specificity and unique catalytic mechanism can be used for developing next-generation aromatase inhibitors.
