187 cases with confirmed asymptomatic hyperuricemia and 187 controls were frequency matched on age, gender and area of residence. We conducted factor analysis using dietary information from a validated food frequency questionnaire to derive dietary patterns. The association between major dietary patterns and asymptomatic hyperuricemia was assessed by logistic regression analysis.
