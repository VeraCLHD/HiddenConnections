The control of Rheb and the mechanism by which it activates mTORC1 remain incompletely understood. Although it has been known for many years that rapamycin interferes with some functions of mTORC1, it is not known how it does this, or why only some functions of mTORC1 are affected. mTORC1 regulates diverse cellular functions.
