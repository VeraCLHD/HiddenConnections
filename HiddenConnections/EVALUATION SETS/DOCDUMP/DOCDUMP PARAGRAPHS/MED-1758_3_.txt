A final sample was collected at 3 mo. RESULTS: Preoperatively, most patients were 25(OH)D deficient (<50 nmol/L) and had secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH > 5 pmol/L). Age, sex, body mass index, season, medical history, and medication use were not associated with significant differences in preoperative plasma 25(OH)D concentrations.
