Abstract Ten subjects with normal renal function were given different single doses of aluminium containing antacids (1, 4, or 8 tablets). The antacid tablets (aluminium content 244 mg tablet-1) were chewed and swallowed either with water, with orange juice, or with citric acid solution. There was a marked increase in serum concentration of aluminium when the antacids was ingested with citric acid (P less than 0.001) or with orange juice (P less than 0.05).
