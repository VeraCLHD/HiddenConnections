In adult men in the intervention town, decreases were observed in urinary sodium (-12 mmol/24 h) and in systolic (-5.6 mm Hg) and diastolic (-2.4 mm Hg) blood pressures, but these trends were the same in the control town (-12 mmol/24 h, -4.9 mm Hg, and 0.2 mm Hg, respectively). The Belgian study and the four other community-based salt intervention trials reviewed show that, in general, salt intake in the long-run cannot be restricted below 5 g/24 h. More moderate salt restriction may constitute a more realistic goal, but its influence on blood pressure in the community at large is probably trivial.
