Abstract BACKGROUND: Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons including dioxins and non-halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ligands of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and stimulate its transformation. Exposure to these environmental contaminants occurs mainly through diet. Recent articles demonstrated that certain food factors regulate the AhR transformation and expression of downstream drug-metabolizing enzymes.
