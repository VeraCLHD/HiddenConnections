Abstract This paper is a Position Statement from an 'ad hoc' Scientific Review Subcommittee of the PAHO/WHO Regional Expert Group on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention through Dietary Salt Reduction. It is produced in response to requests from representatives of countries of the Pan-American Region of WHO needing clarification on two recent publications casting doubts on the appropriateness of population wide policies to reduce salt intake for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The paper provides a brief background, a critical appraisal of the recent reports and explanations as why the implications have been mis-interpreted.
