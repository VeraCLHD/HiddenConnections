Abstract OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that isometric arm exercises were able to increase blood pressure (BP) during the phase of impending vasovagal syncope and allow the patient to avoid losing consciousness. BACKGROUND: Hypotension is always present during the prodromal phase of vasovagal syncope. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of handgrip (HG) and arm-tensing in 19 patients affected by tilt-induced vasovagal syncope.
