Neurocysticercosis was observed in 55 patients, and isolated compromise of striated muscles in the remaining five. Seizures was the primary or sole manifestation of the disease in 72% of patients, and most of them had parenchymal brain cysticerci (either viable cysts or calcifications). Two of seven patients were positive for Taenia eggs.
