However, with an over-supply of nitrate relative to possible photosynthesis, this stored nitrate is still present at harvest and leads to high concentrations in plant tissue. The nitrate content in plants also depends upon other factors, such as plant variety (cultivar), kind and amount of fertiliser, time of harvest and environmental factors such as light intensity, temperature, etc. It is suggested that we should try to meet the recommendations of toxicologists who believe a dramatic reduction nitrate intake for humans is necessary.
