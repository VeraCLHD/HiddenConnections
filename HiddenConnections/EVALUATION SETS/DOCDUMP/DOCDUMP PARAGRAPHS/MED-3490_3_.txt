RESULTS: Oleuropein glycoside and caffeic acid decreased the concentration of interleukin-1beta. At a concentration of 10(-4) M, oleuropein glycoside inhibited interleukin-1beta production by 80%, whereas caffeic acid inhibited production by 40%. Kaempferol decreased the concentration of prostaglandin E2.
