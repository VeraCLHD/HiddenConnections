Predictor Prudent (higher intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole grains), Western (higher intake of red and processed meats, saturated fats, and sweets), and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) style dietary patterns (also greater intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains). Outcomes and Measurements Microalbuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio 25 to 354 mcg/mg) in 2000 and change in kidney function by eGFR between 1989 and 2000. Results After multivariable adjustment, the highest quartile of Western pattern score compared to the lowest quartile was directly associated with microalbuminuria (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.66; p-for trend=0.01) and rapid eGFR decline of â‰¥3 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.03).
