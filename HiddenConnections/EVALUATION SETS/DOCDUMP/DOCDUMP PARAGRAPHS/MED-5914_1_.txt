Recent findings indicate that antioxidants may also have more subtle roles, regulating changes in gene expression induced by oxidizing free radical species. There is increasing evidence that free radicals act as signals for cell adaptation in a variety of cell types and the nature of the mechanisms by which free radical species influence gene expression is the subject of much current research. Processes such as these may be particularly important in tissues regularly exposed to varying amounts of oxidative stress as part of their normal physiological functions.
