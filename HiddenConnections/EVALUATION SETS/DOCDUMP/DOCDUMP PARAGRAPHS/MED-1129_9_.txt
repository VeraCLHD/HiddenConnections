Compared with placebo, there was no significant effect of a daily multivitamin on major cardiovascular events (active and placebo multivitamin groups, 11.0 and 10.8 events per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91–1.10; P=0.91). Further, a daily multivitamin had no effect on total MI (active and placebo multivitamin groups, 3.9 and 4.2 events per 1,000 person-years; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80–1.09; P=0.39), total stroke (active and placebo multivitamin groups, 4.1 and 3.9 events per 1,000 person-years; HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91–1.23; P=0.48), or cardiovascular mortality (active and placebo multivitamin groups, 5.0 and 5.1 events per 1,000 person-years; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83–1.09; P=0.47). A daily multivitamin was also not significantly associated with total mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–1.02; P=0.13).
