Principal component analysis and varimax rotation identified seven physician belief constructs. The mean ratings of the constructs indicated that the physicians slightly agreed that pharmaceutical companies give gifts to physicians to influence their prescribing, moderately disagreed that they do so as a form of professional recognition of physicians, and strongly disagreed that their prescribing behaviour could be influenced by the gifts they receive. Physicians slightly disagreed that pharmaceutical companies' sponsoring of CME programmes are only promotional gimmicks.
