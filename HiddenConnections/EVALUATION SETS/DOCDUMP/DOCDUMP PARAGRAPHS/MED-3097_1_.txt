To investigate this, we examined the effect of an experimental inflammatory challenge on the neural correlates of anhedoniaâ€”namely, reduced ventral striatum (VS) activity to reward cues. We also examined whether this altered neural activity related to inflammatory-induced increases in depressed mood. Methods Participants (n = 39) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or low-dose endotoxin, which increases proinflammatory cytokine levels in a safe manner.
