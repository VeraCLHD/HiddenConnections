After ABHR use, handshaking transferred a mean of 30% of the residual C. difficile spores to the hands of recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Hand washing with soap and water is significantly more effective at removing C. difficile spores from the hands of volunteers than are ABHRs. Residual spores are readily transferred by a handshake after use of ABHR.
