The principle actions of fiber are to alter the nature of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract and to modify the absorption of other nutrients and chemicals. Fiber is but one component of plant food, and to neglect the other components--be they proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, or the secondary metabolites--is to seriously limit our understanding. Much of the effort expended in defining fiber and studying the fiber isolate would have been better focused using this whole-plant-food approach.
