Abstract We have recently demonstrated that both antibodies to Gal alpha(1,3)Gal, and the Gal alpha(1,3)Gal binding lectin (IB4), bind a synthetic peptide (DAHWESWL), there being a similar recognition of carbohydrate and peptide structures. We now report that the anti-Gal alpha(1,3)Gal antibodies and IB4 lectin also react with peptides encoded by mucin genes (MUC 1, 3, 4)-sequences known to be rich in serine, threonine and proline. This activity was demonstrated (1) by the ability of mucin derived peptides to block the reaction of anti-Gal alpha(1,3)Gal antibodies and IB4 lectin with a Gal alpha(1,3)Gal+ pig endothelial cell line; the reactions were specific and did not occur with a random peptide containing the same sequences or with other mucin peptides; (2) by the fact that anti-mucin1 antibodies could react with the Gal alpha(1,3)Gal expressed after transfection of COS cells (Gal alpha(1,3)Gal-,Muc1-) with cDNA encoding the pig alpha, 3galactosyltransferase; and (3) that the IB4 lectin and anti-Gal alpha(1,3)Gal antibodies could react with mucin 1 found on the surface of human breast cancer cells.
