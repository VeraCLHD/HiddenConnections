Expression of Apo-E4 likely increases risk of CAD by elevating blood cholesterol and the risk of AD via proposed interactions with beta-amyloid and/or free radicals (FRs). Any Apo-E4 effect is vague, but FRs probably mediate vascular damage in HyperT. Increasing FR content in the blood is related to increasing CAD severity, while the severity of elevated FR level correlates with how deep into a blood vessel there is activation of the FR scavenger enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD).
