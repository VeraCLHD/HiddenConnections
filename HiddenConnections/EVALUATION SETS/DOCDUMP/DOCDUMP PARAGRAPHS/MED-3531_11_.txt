Age was not significantly different for group C versus the 2 other groups. Intensity; mean standardized uptake value, lean (SUV(L MEAN)); or maximum standardized uptake value, lean (SUV(L MAX)), did not allow differentiation between patterns A and C (P > 0.05). Standardized uptake values (SUV(L MAX), 3.1; SUV(L MEAN), 2.1) were significantly lower in group B than in the 2 other groups (P < 0.005).
