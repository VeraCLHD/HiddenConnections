We report on four cases with prenatal DC, presenting at 34, 35, 36 and 37 weeks of gestation. They were referred to fetal echocardiography because of abnormal routine echo scans with unexplained signs of right heart decompensation. Three patients were medicated during pregnancy with either aspirin (low dose), metamizole or ibuprofen.
