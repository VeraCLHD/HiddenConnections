Metabolites in human urine, particularly of the higher-molecular-weight phthalates, have been associated with allergies and asthma in multiple studies. CONCLUSION: Despite mounting evidence implicating phthalates, causation of allergic disease by these compounds cannot currently be established. In utero and early-life exposures and possible transgenerational effects are not well understood.
