When fat is removed from meat, water is generally added to replace it. Water-binding compounds can be added to prevent the added water from cooking out or evaporating and to prevent patty shrinkage. Fat replacers are generally classified by their composition: protein-based replacers including whey, soy and collagen, lipid-based substances such as soy lecithin which function as emulsifiers maintaining the fat that is retained distributed in the product, and carbohydrate-based substances including flours (wheat, soy, oat), starches (potato, modified corn starch, tapioca) and gums (carrageenan, xanthin).
