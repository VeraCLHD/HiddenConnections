GER patients had greater (p less than 0.05) acid exposure than normals in all study periods, but no differences were found between low and high fat meals in either study position. High fat meals induce upright GER in normals, but do not significantly affect the abnormal amount of GER in patients. In addition, progressive increases in acid exposure were found over the 3 postprandial hours in GER patients in a recumbent position.
