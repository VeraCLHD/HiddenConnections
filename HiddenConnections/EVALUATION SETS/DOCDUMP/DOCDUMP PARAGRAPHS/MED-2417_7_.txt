The latter effect was confirmed with an in vitro assay: cells were incubated with or without beta-cryptoxanthin before preparing an extract, which was then incubated with substrate DNA containing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine; incision was more rapid with the extract prepared from carotenoid-preincubated cells. No significant increases were seen in protein content of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 or apurinic endonuclease 1. The apparent cancer-preventive effects of dietary carotenoids may depend on the enhancement of DNA repair as well as antioxidant protection against damage.
