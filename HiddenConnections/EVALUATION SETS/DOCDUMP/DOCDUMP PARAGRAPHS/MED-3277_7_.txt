Participants with moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis had a faster decline in cognition and function relative to participants without such stenosis. The presence of moderate or severe intracranial arterial stenosis significantly increased the risk of dementia progression, even after controlling for age, sex, education, vascular risk factors, and silent MRI lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial arterial stenosis increased the risk of developing AD dementia after MCI.
