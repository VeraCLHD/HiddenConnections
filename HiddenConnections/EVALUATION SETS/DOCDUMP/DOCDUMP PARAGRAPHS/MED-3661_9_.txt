The increase in colonic activity after sight of food without smell or taste was not significantly different from control or basal activity (p = 0.44 and p = 0.34). Food discussion was the strongest colonic stimulus tested. Food discussion and sham feeding significantly (p<0.02) stimulated gastric acid output above control and basal values.
