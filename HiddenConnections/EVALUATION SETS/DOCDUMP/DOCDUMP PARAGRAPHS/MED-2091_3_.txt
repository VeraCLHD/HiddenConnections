The tip of an atomic force microscope was used as a nanosensor to measure stiffness of living endothelial cells incubated for 3 days in a culture medium containing aldosterone at a physiological concentration (0.45 nM). Endothelial cell stiffness was unaffected by acute changes in sodium concentration <135 mM but rose steeply between 135 and 145 mM. The increase in stiffness occurred within minutes.
