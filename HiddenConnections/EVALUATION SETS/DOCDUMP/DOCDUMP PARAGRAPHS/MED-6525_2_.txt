Basal serum prolactin was significantly elevated in patients compared to normals, although within the normal range. Serum oestradiol concentrations did not differ in the two groups and were also within the normal range. A significant positive correlation between oestradiol and prolactin was found in patients and normals, but with larger prolactin levels in patients.
