A cell proliferation assay was used to determine the extent to which Z is capable of enhancing the mitogenic activity of leptin in HBCECs. RT-PCR was used to explore the possible mechanisms by quantifying the transcription of cyclin D1 and ObR genes. Our results demonstrated that when the HBCECs were pre-treated with 3 nM leptin for 24 h, the sensitivity to Z exposure greatly enhanced the mitogenic action of leptin.
