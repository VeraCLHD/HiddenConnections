When compared with patients with CE, patients with NCYST presented altered working and episodic verbal memory, executive functions, naming, verbal fluency, constructive praxis, and visual-spatial orientation. No correlation emerged between cognitive scores and number, localization, or type of NCYST lesions on MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment was ubiquitous in this sample of patients with active neurocysticercosis (NCYST).
