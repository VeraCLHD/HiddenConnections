Opioid blockade also elicits withdrawal signs after chronic UV exposure. This effect was sufficient to guide operant behavioral choices to avoidance of opioid withdrawal (conditioned place aversion). These UV-induced nociceptive and behavioral effects were absent in Î²-endorphin knockout mice and in mice lacking p53-mediated POMC induction in epidermal keratinocytes.
