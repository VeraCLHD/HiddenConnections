Fasting and post-meal blood samples were obtained for 7 h. Large and small triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), low density (LDL), and high density (HDL) lipoproteins were isolated. Compared to the no-fat, no-cholesterol meal, the fat-enriched meals raised (P < 0.05) plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, and free cholesterol and lowered cholesteryl esters postprandially. The meals containing zero or 140 mg cholesterol generally elicited comparable postprandial plasma and lipoprotein lipid responses.
