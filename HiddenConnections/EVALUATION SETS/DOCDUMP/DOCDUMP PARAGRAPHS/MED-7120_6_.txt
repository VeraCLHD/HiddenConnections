Despite lower postnatal exposures, the child's hair mercury level at age 14 years was associated with prolonged III-V interpeak latencies. All benchmark dose results were similar to those obtained for dose-response relationships at age 7 years. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of prolonged I-III interpeak intervals indicates that some neurotoxic effects from intrauterine MeHg exposure are irreversible.
