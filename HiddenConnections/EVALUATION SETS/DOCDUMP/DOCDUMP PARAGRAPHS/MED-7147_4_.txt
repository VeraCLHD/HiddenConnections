The influence of all the investigated peptides on secretion of IL-4, IL-8, IL-13 and IFN-Î³ was determined by the use of the ELISA tests. Incubating the cells with the peptides has not caused any changes to their enzymatic activity, which has been proved by a WST-1 test. When using a BrdU test, however, it has been observed that there appear changes to proliferation of PBMCs correlated to amounts of bromodeoxyuridine incorporated into the cellular DNA.
