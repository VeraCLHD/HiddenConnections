A first full-term pregnancy above age 30 conveyed a risk of 1.63 (95% CI 1.12–2.38) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.02–1.78) in the pre- and postmenopausal groups respectively. A protective effect of high parity was observed only for postmenopausal breast cancer risk (P for trend test =0.001), with point estimates of 0.79 (95% CI 0.60–1.04), 0.69 (95% CI 0.54–0.88), 0.66 (95% CI 0.51–0.85) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.48–0.86) associated to a one, two, three and four or more full-term pregnancies. A history of spontaneous abortion had no significant effect on the risk of breast cancer diagnosed before or after menopause.
