The mass spectrometry-based approach relies on a previous digestion with Achromobacter lyticus protease and LC-MS/MS separation and detection. Sufficient selectivity was obtained by monitoring four different peptides. The orthogonal (complementary and independent), ELISA-based approach relies on two commercially available bacterial transglutaminase-specific antibodies, combined to a sandwich ELISA.
