Considerable formation of PCDD/Fs was observed in both PCNB formulations (by up to 5600%, to a maximum concentration of 57000 μg ∑PCDD/F kg(-1)) as well as the 2,4-D formulation (by 3000%, to 140 μg ∑PCDD/F kg(-1)). TEQ also increased by up to 980%, to a maximum concentration of 28 μg kg(-1) in PCNB, but did not change in the 2,4-D formulation. Assuming similar yields as observed in the present study as a worst case scenario the use of PCNB in Australia may result in the formation of 155 g TEQ annum(-1), contributed primarily by OCDD formation.
