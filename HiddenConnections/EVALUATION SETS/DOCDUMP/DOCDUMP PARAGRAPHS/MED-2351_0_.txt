Abstract We sought to determine whether hepatic cholesterol crystals are present in patients or mice with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and whether their presence or distribution correlates with the presence of NASH as compared with simple steatosis. We identified, by filipin staining, free cholesterol within hepatocyte lipid droplets in patients with NASH and in C57BL/6J mice that developed NASH following a high-fat high-cholesterol diet. Under polarized light these lipid droplets exhibited strong birefringence suggesting that some of the cholesterol was present in the form of crystals.
