The mean pain intensity difference from baseline measured at 2 hours was significantly (P < .001) greater for patients treated with acetaminophen 1000 mg (0.82) compared with those treated with placebo (0.46). A significant difference in favor of acetaminophen 1000 mg over placebo was also observed at 1 hour after treatment for the percentage of patients with mild to no pain and for mean pain intensity difference from baseline. Acetaminophen 1000 mg was significantly more effective than placebo for all but 1 (pain reduced to none at 2 hours) clinically important secondary pain relief outcomes.
