Induction of differentiation by piceatannol was associated with increased bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) production. Addition of purified BMP-2 protein did not increase the upregulation of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin secretion by piceatannol, whereas the BMP-2 antagonist noggin blocked piceatannol and BMP-2-mediated alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteocalcin secretion enhancement, indicating that BMP-2 production is required in piceatannol-mediated osteoblast maturation and differentiation. In conclusion, piceatannol increased BMP-2 synthesis, and this effect may contribute to its action on the induction of osteoblasts maturation and differentiation, followed by an increase of bone mass.
