The antacid tablets (aluminium content 244 mg tablet-1) were chewed and swallowed either with water, with orange juice, or with citric acid solution. There was a marked increase in serum concentration of aluminium when the antacids was ingested with citric acid (P less than 0.001) or with orange juice (P less than 0.05). When antacids were taken with water, a slight, but significant increase in serum aluminium concentration was seen with 4, but not with 1 or with 8 tablets.
