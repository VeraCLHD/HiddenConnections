We found that chronic changes in total cholesterol in plasma lead to changes in ApoE mRNA levels in brain. We also found that cholesterol loading of primary glial cells increases cellular and secreted ApoE levels and that long-term treatment of astrocytes and microglia with statins leads to a decrease in the cellular and/or secreted ApoE. These observations suggest that disrupted cholesterol metabolism may increase the risk of developing AD in part due to the effect of cholesterol on brain ApoE expression.
