METHODS: Forty-four patients with AR and 29 healthy non-allergic subjects were evaluated. CD161 expression was evaluated on CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells by double immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis. Symptom severity was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale.
