There were no between-condition differences in RPE, affect, or task motivation. Perceived enjoyment increased over time and was consistently higher in the music condition (coefficient = 7.00 [SE = 3.05]; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Music enhances in-task performance and enjoyment of an acute bout of SIT.
