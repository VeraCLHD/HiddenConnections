However, additional co-factors have been identified for each complex, and their importance in mediating mTOR signals has been incompletely elucidated. Similarly, there are differences in mTOR function that reflect the tissue of origin. In this review, we present an alternative view to mTOR complex formation and function, which envisions mTOR regulation and signal propagation as a reflection of cell type- and basal state-dependent conditions.
