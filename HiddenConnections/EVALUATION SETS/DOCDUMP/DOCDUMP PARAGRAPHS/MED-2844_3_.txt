Considering the importance of the pro-inflammatory COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in inflammation and cancers, Morris and colleagues found that urinary PGE-M is positively associated with obesity, smoking, and lung metastases in breast cancer patients (beginning on page XXX). Along the same lines, Kim and colleagues showed a potential association between urinary PGE-M and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women (beginning on page XXX). In agreement with previous reports, their findings indicate that urinary PGE-M may serve as a promising biomarker for prognosticating cancer risk and disease progression.
