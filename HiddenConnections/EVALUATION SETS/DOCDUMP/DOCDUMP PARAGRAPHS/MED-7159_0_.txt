Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether nutritional risk factors, especially black tea consumptions, are inversely associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in male smokers. METHODS: Forty male smokers with clinical diagnosis of COPD (Group-I (GI)) and 36 healthy smokers without COPD (Group-II (GII)) were included in this study. We compared the dietary habits and food intakes of the two groups using an adaptation of the Arizona Food Frequency Questionnaire (AFFQ).
