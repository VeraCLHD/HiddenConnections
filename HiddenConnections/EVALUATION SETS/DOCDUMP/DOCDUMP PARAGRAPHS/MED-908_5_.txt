Hypotheses vary regarding the pathogenic contributions of metastasis-associated phenomena such as de novo expression of alpha gal and its unmasking by desialylation. The means by which alpha gal is sporadically expressed in human tissue remain unknown, as the galactosyl transferase which produces this epitope in constitutively expressive animals has undergone significant mutation at the genomic level in humans. Pathological re-expression is presumed to require permissive changes at a cellular level.
