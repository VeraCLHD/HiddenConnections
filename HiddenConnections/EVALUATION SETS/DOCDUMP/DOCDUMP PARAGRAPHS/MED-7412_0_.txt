Abstract Correlations between mating system and various aspects of genital anatomy suggest a strong influence of sexual selection on genital morphology. We test the generality of the influence by examining whether primate taxa in which there might be enhanced sexual selection (those with multi-male mating systems) possess, as expected, relatively more spinous penises than do taxa with other mating systems. As most prosimians, but few anthropoids (monkeys and apes), possess penile spines, and because the predominant mating systems of the two taxa differ, taxonomic constraints are taken into account.
