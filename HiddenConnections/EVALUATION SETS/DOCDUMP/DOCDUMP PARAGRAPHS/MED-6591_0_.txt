Abstract BACKGROUND: Observational and preclinical studies suggest that dietary fiber intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer, but the results are inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association between dietary fiber intake and risk of breast cancer by conducting a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. DESIGN: Relevant studies were identified by a PubMed database search through January 2011.
