Corresponding RRs (95% CIs) for dietary cholesterol were 1.00 (reference), 1.08 (0.84, 1.32), 1.02 (0.78, 1.29), 1.20 (0.93, 1.55), and 1.45 (1.11, 1.89) (P-trend = 0.04). The substitution of 5% of energy from animal fat for an equal percentage of energy from carbohydrates was associated with significantly increased risk of GDM [RR (95% CI): 1.13 (1.08, 1.18); P < 0.0001]. No significant associations were observed between dietary polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, or trans fat intakes and GDM risk.
