Abstract The gastrointestinal tract is the central organ for uptake of fluids and nutrients, and at the same time it forms the main protective barrier between the sterile environment of the body and the outside world. In mammals, the intestine has further evolved to harbor a vast load of commensal bacteria that have important functions for the host. Discrimination by the host defense system of nonself from self can prevent invasion of pathogens, but equivalent responses to dietary or colonizing bacteria can lead to devastating consequences for the organism.
