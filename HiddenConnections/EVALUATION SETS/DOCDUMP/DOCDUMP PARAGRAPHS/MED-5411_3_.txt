Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP) were used as model chemicals. The proliferation rate of S-phase cells after 24 h of exposure to various concentrations of 17beta-estradiol and to model compounds was compared with a positive and a negative control, containing 1 nM 17beta-estradiol and 0.1% ethanol, respectively. DEHP and 4-n-NP increased the frequency of proliferating MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
