Abstract Multiple pregnancy rates remain high after assisted conception because of a misconceived assumption that transferring three or more embryos will maximize pregnancy rates. Maternal morbidity is sevenfold greater in multiple pregnancies than in singletons, perinatal mortality rates are fourfold higher for twins and sixfold higher for triplets, while cerebral palsy rates are 1-1.5% in twin and 7-8% in triplet pregnancies. Therefore, multiple pregnancies must be considered a serious adverse outcome of assisted reproductive techniques.
