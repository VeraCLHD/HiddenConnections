RESULTS: In the healthy volunteer controls, Dtvi and Dtvi x HR increased after food intake with a peak value at 15 min, which indicates the presence of postprandial surge in the CBF. Fasting values and peak values at 15 min were significantly different (Dtvi: 15.1 +/- 4.9 cm/s vs. 18.9 +/- 5.9 cm/s, p = 0.04, Dtvi x HR: 862.2 +/- 261.5 cm/min vs. 1,174.2 +/- 307.5, p = 0.002). In contrast with the controls, despite postprandial increase in double product (HR x blood pressure), Dtvi and Dtvi x HR in the patient group decreased after food intake, with a nadir value at 45 min.
