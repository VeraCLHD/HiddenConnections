Several methods for the assessment ofantioxidant efficacy using free radical scavenging such as oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter assay (TEAC), ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) and 2,2'-diphenyl-11-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay are described. An example of methods based on the assessment of antioxidant efficacy using significant biological substrates is also presented. Critical opinions concerning the proposed methods are presented.
