Abstract Anthocyanins, belonging to the flavonoid family of phytochemicals, have received attention as agents that may have potential in preventing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. In the present study, an anthocyanin-rich extract from Concord grapes [referred to as Concord grape extract (CGE)] and the anthocyanin delphinidin were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit DNA adduct formation due to the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP) in MCF-10F cells, a noncancerous, immortalized human breast epithelial cell line. CGE at 10 and 20 microg/mL and delphinidin at 0.6 microM concentrations significantly inhibited BP-DNA adduct formation.
