Annexin V- and propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by FACS analysis was used to differentiate between apoptotic and necrotic events. SFN and Ox alone inhibited cell growth of Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, an effect, which could be synergistically enhanced, when cells were incubated with the combination of both agents. Co-treated cells further displayed distinctive morphological changes that occurred during the apoptotic process, such as cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, membrane blebbing as well as the occurence of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments.
