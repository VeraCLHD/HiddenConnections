Measurements and Results: During a median follow-up of 14.3 years, there were 1964 deaths (men and women: 1038 and 926) from stroke, 881 (508 and 373) from coronary heart disease, 4287 (2297 and 1990) from cardiovascular disease, 5465 (3432 and 2033) from cancer, and 14,540 (8548 and 5992) from all causes. Compared with a sleep duration of 7 hours, sleep duration of 4 hours or less was associated with increased mortality from coronary heart disease for women and noncardiovascular disease/noncancer and all causes in both sexes. The respective multivariable hazard ratios were 2.32 (1.19–4.50) for coronary heart disease in women, 1.49 (1.02–2.18) and 1.47 (1.01–2.15) for noncardiovascular disease/noncancer, and 1.29 (1.02–1.64) and 1.28 (1.03–1.60) for all causes in men and women, respectively.
