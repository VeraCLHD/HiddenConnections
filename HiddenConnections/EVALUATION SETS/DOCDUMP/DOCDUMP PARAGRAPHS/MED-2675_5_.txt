Rates of each event were calculated, and a Cox Proportional Hazards Model with a competing risk framework was used to examine risk factors for ESRD as compared with death. Predictors included age, gender, race, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, tobacco use, eGFR, and total cholesterol. KEY RESULTS During 9.7Â years of follow-up, 5% of the cohort progressed to ESRD, and 61% of the cohort died.
