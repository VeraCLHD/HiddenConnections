We undertook this cross-sectional observational study to test the hypothesis that regular garlic intake would delay the stiffening of the aorta relating to aging. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied healthy adults (n=101; age, 50 to 80 years) who were taking > or = 300 mg/d of standardized garlic powder for > or = 2 years and 101 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pressure-standardized elastic vascular resistance (EVR) were used to measure the elastic properties of the aorta.
