After short survey of structural diversity represented by plant phenolics, we focus on the compounds which either have obvious dietary significance or rich record of pharmacological studies, or both. It can be seen that apart from growing use of phytochemicals in dietary supplements, slow progress through clinical trials towards new drug registration is observed in that category of natural products. Such waste of resources on the way of transformation from renewable materials to high tech/high value products aimed for improved human healthcare is deplorable and should be reformed in name of sustainability.
