The addition of protein increased the insulin responses to both carbohydrates and slightly reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato (F = 2.04, p less than 0.05). The further addition of fat reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato (F = 14.63, p less than 0.001) without any change in the blood glucose response to spaghetti (F = 0.94, NS). The different responses to coingestion of protein and fat reduced the difference between the glycemic responses to the two carbohydrates.
