(C) Epidemiologic relationships show health benefits if 25(OH)D levels exceed 70Â nmol/L; these include fewer falls, better tooth attachment, less colorectal cancer, improved depression and wellbeing. Some studies of populations at high-latitude relate higher 25(OH)D to risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer or mortality. Those relationships are attributable to the dynamic fluctuations in 25(OH)D specific to high latitudes, and which can be corrected by maintaining 25(OH)D at steady, high levels throughout the year, the way they are in the tropics.
