We examined trends in the age-adjusted incidence of invasive female breast cancer and compared these with trends in the use of EPHT, after grouping all California counties into three groups based on EPHT use in 2001. We also examined CHIS data on trends in screening mammography. Results In 2001, there were large regional differences in EPHT use and breast cancer incidence.
