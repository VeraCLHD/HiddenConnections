The design and potential long-term positive and negative consequences of chemoprevention clinical trials are critically discussed, with the objective of exposing the major differences that exist between clinical trials in cancer chemoprevention and those in cancer chemotherapy. Results of completed prevention trials and details of ongoing trials are presented and discussed. Based on the laboratory, epidemiological, and clinical evidence presented, it is concluded that chemoprevention offers excellent prospects as a means of reducing cancer incidence.
