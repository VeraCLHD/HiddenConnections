Abstract Symptoms of tear dysfunction after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) occur in nearly all patients and resolve in the vast majority. Although dry eye complaints are a leading cause of patient discomfort and dissatisfaction after LASIK, the symptoms are not uniform, and the disease is not a single entity. Post-LASIK tear dysfunction syndrome or dry eye is a term used to describe a spectrum of disease encompassing transient or persistent post-operative neurotrophic disease, tear instability, true aqueous tear deficiency, and neuropathic pain states.
