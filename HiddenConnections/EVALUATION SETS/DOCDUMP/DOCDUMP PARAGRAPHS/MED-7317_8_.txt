Even among those with LDL>130 mg/dL, 50% or less received LLT. Predictors of LLT at discharge included LLT before admission, hyperlipidemia, prior coronary artery disease, increasing body mass index, and in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention. Although there was some temporal improvement in the rate of LLT from 2005 to 2007, a decline in use of LLT was noted in 2008 and 2009.
