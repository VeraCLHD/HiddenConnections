The amount of fruit and vegetable intake did not predict plasma beta-carotene levels in women consuming a raw food diet. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma beta-carotene concentrations differed among the diet groups, with highest plasma levels in women adhering to wholesome nutrition. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations may not reflect beta-carotene intake and the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed.
