METHODS: This study included residents (slightly over 200000) from 30 'aboriginal townships' in Taiwan. The gap in life expectancy between aborigines and the general population was analysed by decomposing these gaps according to major causes of deaths. This analysis quantifies the contribution of different causes of deaths to the gap in life expectancy between the two populations.
