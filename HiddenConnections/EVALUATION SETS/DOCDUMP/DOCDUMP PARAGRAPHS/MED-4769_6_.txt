Fasting blood lipids were measured on day zero and at the end of each phase. RESULTS: Wheat bran had no effect on total, LDL or HDL cholesterol irrespective of particle size or level of gluten in the diet. However, consumption of increased gluten in the metabolic study was associated with a 13+/-4% reduction in serum triglycerides (p = 0.005) which was not seen in the normal-gluten ad libitum study.
