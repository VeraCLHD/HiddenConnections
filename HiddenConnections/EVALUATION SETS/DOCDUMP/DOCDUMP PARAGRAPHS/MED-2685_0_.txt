Abstract INTRODUCTION: Dental caries prevalence in UK children remains high and obesity, closely linked to Type 2 diabetes, is rising. Literature suggests that dentists may not give dietary advice due to a lack of clear and consistent guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether oral health education leaflets with a food and nutritional focus conform to existing UK national nutritional guidelines from the Department of Health (DoH), the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA).
