Abstract It has been demonstrated that nitrates are reduced to nitrites in humans, possibly through bacterial activity. Nitrites, together with ubiquitous amines, can lead to an in-vivo synthesis of carcinogenic nitrosamines. The average daily intake of nitrates depends upon the amount of vegetables consumed and on the nitrate concentration in drinking water.
