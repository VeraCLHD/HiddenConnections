Abstract Diethylstilboestrol (DES) is an endocrine disrupter which causes cancer in rodents. It was prescribed in large amounts to treat women with gynaecological problems; some of the daughters of these women subsequently developed a rare cancer (vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma) while genital abnormalities were found in some of the sons. It was used for decades in livestock feed and this may have contaminated the food chain leading to the exposure of the more general population.
