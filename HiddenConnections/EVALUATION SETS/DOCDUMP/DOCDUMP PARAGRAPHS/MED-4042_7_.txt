Predefined outcome measures were BDG-induced changes in pro and antiinflammatory markers in circulating blood and gene expression in adipose tissue and peripheral insulin sensitivity expressed as M value. The BDG consumption for 4 weeks significantly increased both circulating levels and adipose tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in overweight and obese humans. Insulin sensitivity as well as circulating levels and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines were unaffected by BDG treatment.
