Plaque MPs expressed surface antigens consistent with their leukocyte origin, including major histocompatibility complex classes I and II, and induced a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on T-cell proliferation. Notably, taurine, the most abundant free organic acid in human neutrophils, which scavenges myeloperoxidase-catalyzed free radicals, was highly enriched in plaque MPs. Moreover, fluorescent labeling of proteins on the MP surface suggested immunoglobulins to be trapped inside, which was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis on permeabilized and nonpermeabilized plaque MPs.
