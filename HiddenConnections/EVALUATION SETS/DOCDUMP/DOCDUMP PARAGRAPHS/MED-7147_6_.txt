When using a BrdU test, however, it has been observed that there appear changes to proliferation of PBMCs correlated to amounts of bromodeoxyuridine incorporated into the cellular DNA. Moreover, changes to secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 by the cells under the influence of agonists were detected, as well as changes to secretion of IFN-gamma under the influence of all the examined substances. The obtained results provide information on immunomodulatory effects of food-derived opioid peptides, which may be of clinical significance especially in the case of allergic diseases in newborns.
