Notably, taurine, the most abundant free organic acid in human neutrophils, which scavenges myeloperoxidase-catalyzed free radicals, was highly enriched in plaque MPs. Moreover, fluorescent labeling of proteins on the MP surface suggested immunoglobulins to be trapped inside, which was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis on permeabilized and nonpermeabilized plaque MPs. Colabeling for CD14 and IgG established that more than 90% of the IgG containing MPs were CD14(+), indicating a macrophage origin.
