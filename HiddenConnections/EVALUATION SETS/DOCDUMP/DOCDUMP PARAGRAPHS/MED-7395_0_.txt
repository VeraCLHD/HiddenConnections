Abstract The authors investigated the associations between bowel movement and constipation frequencies and colorectal cancer (CRC) endpoints among men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer (n = 58,279) and explored whether dietary fiber intake may modify associations. After 13.3 years (1986-1999), 1,207 CRC cases and 1,753 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analyses. Multivariate analyses showed a significantly increased hazard ratio for CRC overall and rectal cancer in men who reported having a bowel movement 1-2 times per day (second-highest category) as compared with once a day (CRC: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.53 (P(trend) < 0.001); rectal cancer: HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.95 (P(trend) = 0.001)).
