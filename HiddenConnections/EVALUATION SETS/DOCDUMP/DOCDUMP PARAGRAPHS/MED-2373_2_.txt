METHODS: We analyzed the effect of RHR on end points in the National FINRISK Study; a representative, prospective study using Cox proportional hazards model. Ten-thousand five-hundred nineteen men and 11,334 women were included, excluding those with preexisting coronary heart disease, angina, heart failure, or on antihypertensive therapy. RESULTS: The hazard ratios for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality for each 15 beats/min increase in RHR were 1.24 (1.11-1.40) in men and 1.32 (1.08-1.60) in women, adjusted for age, gender, total cholesterol, physical activity (categorical), SBP, body mass index, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
