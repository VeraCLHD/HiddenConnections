The results indicate that the differential potency for inhibition of cancer cell invasion was BDMC> or =DMC>Cur, whereas the cell migration was not affected. Zymography analysis exhibited that curcumin, DMC and BDMC significantly decreased uPA, active-MMP-2 and MMP-9 but not pro-MMP-2 secretion from the cells in a dose-dependent manner, in which BDMC and DMC show higher potency than curcumin. The suppression of active MMP-2 level correlated with inhibition of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 protein levels involved in pro-MMP-2 activation.
