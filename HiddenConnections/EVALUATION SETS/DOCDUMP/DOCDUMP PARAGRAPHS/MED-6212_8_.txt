CONCLUSIONS: In healthy, middle-aged, moderately overweight men, orange juice decreases DBP when regularly consumed and postprandially increases endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity. Our study suggests that hesperidin could be causally linked to the beneficial effect of orange juice. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00983086.
