Similarly, those that believe almost all doctors accept gifts were more likely to report low physician trust (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.25–2.29) and high health care system distrust (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.82–3.62). CONCLUSIONS Patients perceive physician–industry gift relationships as common. Patients that believe gift relationships exist report lower levels of physician trust and higher rates of health care system distrust.
