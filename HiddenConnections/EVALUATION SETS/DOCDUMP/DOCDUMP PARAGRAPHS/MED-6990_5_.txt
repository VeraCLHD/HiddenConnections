Appetite, insulin resistance, and metabolic parameters were measured. We found an increased level of satiety (overall p-value 0.0079) and sense of fullness (p=0.05) in pre-lunch questionnaires following the walnut breakfast as compared to the placebo breakfast, with the walnut effect achieving significance on day 3 and 4 (p=0.02 and p=0.03). We did not find any change in resting energy expenditure, hormones known to mediate satiety, or insulin resistance when comparing the walnut versus placebo diet.
