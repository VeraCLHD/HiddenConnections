METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 213 subjects from the general population, without liver disease, was studied. Evaluation of medical history, dietary and physical activity habits, fasting blood tests and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD was performed at baseline and after a 7-year follow-up by identical protocols. RESULTS: From 147 patients that did not have NAFLD at baseline, 28 (19%) developed NAFLD at the 7-year follow-up.
