These samples were used to compare the sensitivity of six different laboratory culture methods either in common use or described in the literature with that of a polymerase chain reaction with two primer pairs (multiplex PCR). Then, only PCR was used to examine tonsils, caecum and caecal lymph nodes from two groups of slaughter pigs: 210 from six conventional fattening farms and 200 from three with alternative housing. The results of the multiplex PCR were positive in 28 cases.
