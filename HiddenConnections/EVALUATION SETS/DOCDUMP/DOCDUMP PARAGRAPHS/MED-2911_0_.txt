Abstract Gas-liquid chromatography analyses have been carried out to investigate the composition of esterified fatty acids in the plasma lipids in 130 Greenland Eskimos, compared with those of 32 Greenland Eskimos living in Denmark and of 31 Caucasian Danes in Denmark. While the Eskimos living in Denmark did not differ substantially from other persons living in Denmark and, from what is found in other studies in Western communities, the Greenland Eskimos showed a completely different pattern. They demonstrated a much higher proportion of palmitic, palmitoleic, and timnodonic acids, while they had a markedly lower concentration of linoleic acid.
