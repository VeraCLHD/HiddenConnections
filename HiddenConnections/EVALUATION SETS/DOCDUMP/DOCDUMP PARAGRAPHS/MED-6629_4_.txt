METHODS: Ninety-four overweight adults (body mass index > 25 kg m(-2)) were randomly assigned to add two fruit and nut bars totalling 1421.9 kJ (340 kcal) to their ad libitum diet (intervention group) or to continue with their ad libitum diet (control group). Subjects underwent assessment for weight (primary outcome measure), as well as waist circumference, lipid panel and blood pressure (secondary outcome measures), before and at the end of the 8-week treatment. RESULTS: Weight did not change from baseline after snack bar addition compared to controls (P = 0.44).
