Using densitometry, the results showed that the stem hyperemic flow (Q) and the associated crown lumen volume (V) were related by Q = 159.08 V3/4 (r = 0.98, SEE = 10.59 ml/min). The stem hyperemic flow and the associated crown length (L) using cone-beam CT were related by Q = 2.89 L (r = 0.99, SEE = 8.72 ml/min). These results indicate that measured arterial branch lengths or lumen volumes can potentially be used to predict the expected hyperemic flow in an arterial tree.
