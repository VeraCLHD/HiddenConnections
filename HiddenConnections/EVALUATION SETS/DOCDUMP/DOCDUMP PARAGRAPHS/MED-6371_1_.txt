Confluent monolayers of gastric cell line in microtiter plate wells were exposed to bacterial suspensions prepared from 83 H. pylori isolates from antibiotic-treated and untreated patients in the presence and absence of the cranberry constituent. Urease assay was used to calculate the percentage of adhesion inhibition. In two thirds of the isolates, adhesion to the gastric cells was inhibited by 0.2 mg/mL of the nondialysable material.
