Abstract To examine whether meat intake modifies breast-cancer risk, a case-control study was conducted in Uruguay. Dietary patterns were assessed in detail (for cases, before diagnosis or symptoms occurred) using a food frequency questionnaire involving 64 food items, which allowed total energy intake to be calculated. Nutrient residuals were calculated through regression analysis.
