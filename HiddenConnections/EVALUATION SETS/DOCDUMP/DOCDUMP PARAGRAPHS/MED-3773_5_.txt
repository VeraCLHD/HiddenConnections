RESULTS: Six prospective studies, which contained a total of 131,553 participants and 2,459 CHD cases, met the inclusion criteria. Combined results indicated that participants with higher heme iron intake had a 31% increased risk of CHD, compared with those with lower intake (RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.67), with significant heterogeneity (P(heterogeneity) = 0.05, I(2) = 55.0%). Excluding the only study from Japan (limiting to Western studies) yielded a RR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.21-1.76), with no study heterogeneity (P(heterogeneity) = 0.44, I(2) = 0.0%).
