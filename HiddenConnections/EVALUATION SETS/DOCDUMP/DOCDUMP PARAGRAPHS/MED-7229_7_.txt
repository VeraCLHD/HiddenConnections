During 30 years of follow-up, there were 11 esophageal carcinomas and 10 other malignant tumors (4 hepatic cell carcinomas, 3 lung cancers, 2 breast cancers, and 1 leukemia) documented in the study group, while no cancer developed in the control group. The risk for esophageal carcinoma was significantly increased in the study group compared with the control group (relative risk = 1.26, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.46, chi-square = 116.83, P < 0.001). Long-term exposure to sodium nitrite markedly increases the risk of esophageal carcinoma in human body.
