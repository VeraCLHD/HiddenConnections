CONCLUSIONS: Histologic disc alterations can reliably be graded based on the proposed classification system providing a morphologic framework for more sophisticated molecular biologic analyses of factors leading to age-related disc changes. Diminished blood supply to the intervertebral disc in the first half of the second life decade appears to initiate tissue breakdown.
