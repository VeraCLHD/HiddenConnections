The effects of CRCs on inflammatory signaling pathways of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4, respectively induced by IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, in human aortic smooth muscle cells cultured in vitro were also investigated. HAECs were pretreated with 10 μM of CRCs, Chl a+b, and aspirin (Asp) for 18 h followed by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (2 ng/mL) for 6 h, and U937 cell adhesion was determined. TNF-α–induced monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion was significantly inhibited by CRCs.
