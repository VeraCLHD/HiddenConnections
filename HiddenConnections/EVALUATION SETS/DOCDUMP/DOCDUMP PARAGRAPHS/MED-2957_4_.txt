In a phase I-II trial performed by Riordan et al, none of 24 cancer patients treated with i.v. vitamin C responded. At this point we don't have information as to which is the actual plasma level of vitamin C that can produce tumor shrinkage. We don't have consistent information either regarding what is the clinical dose necessary to yield therapeutic plasma levels.
