Abstract Objective: To compare selected immunohistological features of inflammation in synovial tissue from patients with early and late osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Synovial tissue samples were obtained from 10 patients with knee pain, normal radiographs, and arthroscopic manifestations of OA (early OA), and from 15 patients with OA undergoing knee joint arthroplasty (late OA). Conventional immunohistochemical techniques were used to measure microscopic manifestations of inflammation.
