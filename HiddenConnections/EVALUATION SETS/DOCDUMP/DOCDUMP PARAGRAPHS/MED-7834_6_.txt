The specificity of the reactivity was strongly suggested by competition studies and by ruling out cross-reacting antibodies to other chronic human viruses. Our results suggest that antibodies reactive with the BLV capsid antigen may serve as a biomarker for exposure to BLV and this exposure may be widespread. The results do not necessarily mean that humans are actually infected with BLV; the antibodies could be a response to heat-denatured BLV antigens consumed in food.
