OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare the short-term effect of a high-fat meal and a high-carbohydrate meal, with and without dietary antioxidants, on vasomotor, antiplatelet, and hemostatic functions of the endothelium in healthy subjects. DESIGN: In an observer-blinded, randomized crossover study, 25 (13 men and 12 women) healthy subjects were given each of 3 meals in random order at 1-wk intervals: a high-fat meal (760 kcal), an isoenergetic high-carbohydrate meal, and a high-fat meal with dietary antioxidants from vegetables (865 kcal). Endothelial functions, as assessed by hemodynamic and rheologic responses to L-arginine--the natural precursor of nitric oxide--were evaluated before and 4 h after each meal.
