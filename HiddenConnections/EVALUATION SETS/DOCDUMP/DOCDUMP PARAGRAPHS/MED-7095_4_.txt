On low-cholesterol diets the concentration of each of the major lipoprotein classes were similar during the soy and the casein dietary periods. On cholesterol-enriched diets, the concentration of LDL-C stabilized at a 16% lower level on soy protein than on the casein diet (p less than 0.02), while the concentration of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was 16% higher (p less than 0.01). Since the difference in LDL-C (p less than 0.05) and in HDL-C (p less than 0.025) levels on casein and on soy protein diets were significantly greater on the high than on the low cholesterol intake, the findings indicate that the level of dietary cholesterol may determine whether plant and animal dietary proteins have similar or different effects on plasma LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations.
