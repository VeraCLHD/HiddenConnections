Results Constipation was not associated with an increased risk of diverticulosis. Participants with less frequent bowel movements (BM: <7/wk) had reduced odds of diverticulosis compared to those with regular (7/wk) BM (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40–0.80). Those reporting hard stools also had a reduced odds (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55–1.02).
