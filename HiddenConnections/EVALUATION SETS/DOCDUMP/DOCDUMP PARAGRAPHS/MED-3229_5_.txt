After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1,449 subjects aged 65 to 79 years were reexamined in 1998. RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects, 6.1% of the population (average age, 72 years) met the criteria for MCI. Midlife elevated serum cholesterol level (> or =6.5 mmol/L) was a significant risk factor for MCI (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.0, adjusted for age and body mass index); the effect of systolic blood pressure approached significance.
