METHODS: As part of the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a population-based telephone survey, 299,658 adults reported their use of alcohol in the preceding month and a history of sunburn in the preceding year. RESULTS: Approximately 33.5% of respondents reported a sunburn within the past year. Heavier average alcohol use and binge drinking were both positively associated with prevalence and number of sunburns within the past year.
