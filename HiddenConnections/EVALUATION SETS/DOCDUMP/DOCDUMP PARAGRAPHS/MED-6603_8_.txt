Proliferation rates were significantly lower (P < 0.002) among men assigned to the flaxseed arms. Median Ki-67 positive cells/total nuclei ratios (x100) were 1.66 (flaxseed-supplemented diet) and 1.50 (flaxseed-supplemented, low-fat diet) vs. 3.23 (control) and 2.56 (low-fat diet). No differences were observed between arms with regard to side effects, apoptosis, and most serological endpoints; however, men on low-fat diets experienced significant decreases in serum cholesterol (P=0.048).
