A rapid effect on cells of high bile acid exposure is the generation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, disruption of the cell membrane and mitochondria, induction of DNA damage, mutation and apoptosis, and development of reduced apoptosis capability upon chronic exposure. Here, we review the substantial evidence of the mechanism of secondary bile acids and their role in colon cancer.
