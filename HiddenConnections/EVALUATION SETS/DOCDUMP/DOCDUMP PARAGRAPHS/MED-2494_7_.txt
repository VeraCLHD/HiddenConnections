In rats with experimental diabetic neuropathy nerve blood flow is reduced and oxygen supplementation or vasodilator treatment improved the deterioration in conduction velocity and nerve blood flow. Similarly, in human diabetic neuropathy, there is impaired nerve blood flow, epineurial arterio-venous shunting and a reduction in sural nerve oxygen tension. At what stage during the development of nerve damage these changes occur is yet to be determined.
