We conclude that preclinical activity associated with cetuximab monotherapy does not correlate directly with relative basal levels of total or activated (pY1068) EGFR in a tumor. Moreover, robust single-agent activity by cetuximab may be the best predictor for this agent to potentiate chemotherapy-mediated antitumor activities.
