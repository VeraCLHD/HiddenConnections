Abstract DNA content of gastric aspirates was studied before and after intragastric infusions of three doses of ginger (2, 4, 6 g) and four doses of garlic (0.3, 0.75, 1.5, 3 g) on different days in volunteers. Only one dose was administered on any day. The mean changes of DNA-p/min in gastric aspirates after intragastric infusions of 2 and 4 g ginger were -1.37 +/- 2.3 and 6.74 +/- 3.06 respectively, which were not significant statistically.
