Squatting significantly increased SBP and DBP in all 3 groups (7.1 +/-5.1, 4.6+/-5.8 mmHg in group I, 7.8+/-5.9, 4.3+/-4.7 mmHg in group II, 6.5+/-5.0, 3.7+/-3.9 mmHg in group III; p < 0.05). However, handgrip did not exert any significant influence on the hemodynamics in any group nor did heart rate change significantly during the physical maneuvers in any group. During the repeat HUT, prodromal symptoms with hypotension developed in 13 of the 21 patients and of these 5 fainted immediately after and were not able to do the physical maneuvers.
