Second, thin biological membranes (20-40 microm) were put in the path of growing crystals to determine damage during crystallization. RESULTS: As cholesterol crystallized, the peak volume increased rapidly by up to 45% over 3 min and sharp-tipped crystals cut through and tore membranes. The amount of cholesterol and peak level of crystal growth correlated directly (r = 0.98; p < 0.01), as did the amount of cholesterol and rate of crystal growth (r = 0.99; p < 0.01).
