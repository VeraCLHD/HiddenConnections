Curcumin induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca+2, decreased the levels of mitochondria membrane potential and induced caspase-3 activity. Curcumin also promoted the expression of Bax, cytochrome C, p53 and p21 but inhibited the expression of Bcl-2. These observations suggest that curcumin may have a possible therapeutic potential in colon cancer patients.
