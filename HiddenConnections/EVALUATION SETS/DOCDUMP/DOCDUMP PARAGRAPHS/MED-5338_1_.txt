METHODS: Twenty-seven individuals were placed into one of three treatment groups and longitudinally followed up to examine the effects of diet and hyperlipidemic medications on TC and TG levels. Group 1 (n = 14) received neither dietary nor drug therapy. Group 2 (n = 9) received dietary counseling without concomitant hyperlipidemic medications.
