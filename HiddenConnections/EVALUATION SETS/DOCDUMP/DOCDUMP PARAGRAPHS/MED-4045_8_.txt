Consumption of whole grains was associated with lower likelihood of having histological steatohepatitis (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-1.000), after adjusting for sex and energy intake, but the association became weaker after further adjusting for abdominal fat or interleukin-6 levels. In the case-control analysis, consumption of refined grains was associated with higher odds of having NAFLD (OR 1.021, 95% CI 1.001-1.042), after adjusting for age, sex, energy intake, abdominal fat level, HOMA-IR, LDL, adiponectin and TNF-Î±. CONCLUSIONS: Although refined grain consumption increased the likelihood of having NAFLD, whole-grain consumption favorably affected clinical characteristics of patients with NAFLD and tended to be associated with less severe disease.
