METHODS: Thirty-eight elite America's Cup yacht racing athletes were studied over 50 wk of training. Resting, unstimulated saliva samples were collected weekly (38 h after exercise, consistent time of day, fasted) together with clinically confirmed URI, training load, and perceived fatigue rating. RESULTS: s-IgA was highly variable within (coefficients of variation [CV] = 48%) and between subjects (CV = 71%).
