Abstract Oxidative stress is a key component in linking environmental toxicity to the multistage carcinogenic process. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in response to both endogenous and exogenous stimuli. To counterbalance ROS-mediated injury, an endogenous antioxidants defense system exists; however, when oxidation exceeds the control mechanisms, oxidative stress arises.
