The SCFA butyrate (mean, HRS = 35.1; mean, LRS = 17.6; p < 0.05) and acetate (mean, HRS = 93.9; mean, LRS = 65.8; p < 0.05) were significantly elevated on the stale maize porridge diet when compared with consumption of fresh maize porridge. SCFA propionate (mean, HRS = 43.1; mean, LRS = 24.8; p = 0.05), also increased with stale maize porridge, but was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A high-resistant starch diet and its resultant increase in fermentation products may be partly responsible for protecting the black population against colorectal cancers and other large bowel diseases.
