In this study, we performed a clinical trial to further confirm the effect of HSE. Subjects with a BMI â‰§ 27 and aged 18-65, were randomly divided into control (n = 17) and HSE-treated (n = 19) groups, respectively, for 12 weeks. Our data showed that consumption of HSE reduced body weight, BMI, body fat and the waist-to-hip ratio.
