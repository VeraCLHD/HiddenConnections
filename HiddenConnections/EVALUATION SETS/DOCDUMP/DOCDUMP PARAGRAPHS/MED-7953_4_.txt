Maximum urinary flows insignificantly increased 0.43 +/- 1.57, 1.86 +/- 1.08, and 2.7 +/- 1.93 mL/second (mean +/- SE, no statistical significance reached), and postvoiding urine volume decreased insignificantly by -29.4 +/- 20.46, -19.2 +/- 16.91, and -55.62 +/- 36.45 mL (mean +/- SE, no statistical significance reached). Plasma concentrations of secoisolariciresinol (SECO), enterodiol (ED), and enterolactone (EL) were significantly raised after the supplementation. The observed decreases in IPSS and QOL score were correlated with the concentrations of plasma total lignans, SECO, ED, and EL.
