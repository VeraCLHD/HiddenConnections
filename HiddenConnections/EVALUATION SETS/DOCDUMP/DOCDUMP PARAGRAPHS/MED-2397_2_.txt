Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause mortality in relation to healthy lifestyle factors (not currently smoking, not heavily drinking, walking 1 h or more per day, sleeping 6.5 to 7.4 h per day, eating green-leafy vegetables almost daily and BMI between 18.5 and 24.9) were calculated from proportional-hazards regression models. We also estimated population-attributable fractions of death to address the impact of potential lifestyle modifications on mortality. RESULTS: Until 2003, 8497 deaths were observed.
