Abstract To evaluate effects of acute loading of different proteins on renal function, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin excretion rate (AER), and concentrations of plasma amino acids, 11 normal volunteers and 20 diabetic patients were studied before and after eating 1.0 g/kg body weight of either tuna fish meal or bean curd on separate days. In normal subjects, the mean baseline GFR was 115.8 +/- 9.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, and the mean GFRs after ingestion of tuna fish meal were 134.1 +/- 15.5 (1 hr), 146.2 +/- 18.8 (2 hr), and 157.8 +/- 21.2 (3 hr), respectively. GFR did not significantly increase in normal subjects after ingestion of bean curd.
