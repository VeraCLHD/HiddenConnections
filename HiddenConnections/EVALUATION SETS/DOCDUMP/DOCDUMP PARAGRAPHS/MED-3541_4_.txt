As compared to when working 16-hours shifts, on-call residents have twice as many attentional failures when working overnight and commit 36% more serious medical errors. They also report making 300% more fatigue-related medical errors that lead to a patient's death. CONCLUSION: The weight of evidence strongly suggests that extended-duration work shifts significantly increase fatigue and impair performance and safety.
