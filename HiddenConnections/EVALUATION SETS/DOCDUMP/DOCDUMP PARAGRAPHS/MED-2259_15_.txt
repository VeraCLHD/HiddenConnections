Nerve-sparing (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.16-0.95) reduced the risk of PS. CONCLUSIONS: Orgasm-associated problems, UI during sexual activity, penile sensory changes, PS, and penile deformity are common side effects to RP. Daytime UI, erectile dysfunction, and nerve-sparing status can help identify patients at risk.
