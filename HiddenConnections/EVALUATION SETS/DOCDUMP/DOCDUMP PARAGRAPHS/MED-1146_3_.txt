METHODS: We used a national probability sample of the US population to determine the independent association between reported gout and history of kidney stone disease. RESULTS: Among men and women 20 years and older, 5.6% (10 million) reported the previous passage of a kidney stone and 2.7% (5.1 million) reported a diagnosis of gout by a physician. Moreover, 8.6% of individuals who reported the passage of a kidney stone on two or more occasions had a history of gout.
