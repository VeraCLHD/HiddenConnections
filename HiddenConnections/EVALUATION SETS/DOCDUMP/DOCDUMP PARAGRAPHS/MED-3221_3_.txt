The role of apolipoprotein E and its isoforms, in particular ApoE4, in cholesterol and Abeta binding is presented, in relation to genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol oxidation products are of importance in generation of Alzheimer's disease, possibly induced by Abeta-produced hydrogen peroxide. The body of evidence for a link between cholesterol in atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease is increasing, along with an associated inflammatory response.
