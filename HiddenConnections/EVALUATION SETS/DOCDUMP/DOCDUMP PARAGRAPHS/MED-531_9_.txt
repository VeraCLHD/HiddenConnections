Relationships among lesion depths and physiochemical properties were evaluated using the Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: pH, titratable acidity and fluoride concentrations differed between tea flavors (P < 0.05) and between brands (P < 0.05). Lesion depths produced by the citrus tea (83.1 +/- 10.3 microm) were greater than those produced by the fruity tea (56.5 +/- 6.1 microm); both teas produced greater depths than black (30.1 +/- 7.4 microm), floral (25.0 +/- 3.2 microm) or green (22.3 +/- 6.3 microm) teas (P < 0.05).
