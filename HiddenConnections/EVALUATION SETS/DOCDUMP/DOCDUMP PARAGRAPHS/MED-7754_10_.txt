In an analysis controlling for medication changes, a low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet recommendations. Whether the observed differences provide clinical benefit for the macro- or microvascular complications of diabetes remains to be established. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as {"type":"clinical-trial","attrs":{"text":"NCT00276939","term_id":"NCT00276939"}}NCT00276939.
