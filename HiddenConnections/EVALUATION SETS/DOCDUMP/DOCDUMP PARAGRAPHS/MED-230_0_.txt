Abstract OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to find the threshold of benefit for a hypothetical cholesterol-lowering drug below which the subject would not be prepared to take the drug. We also looked at whether proximity to the target event (myocardial infarction) and the subjects' views on drug taking affected this threshold. DESIGN: We studied 307 subjects using a written questionnaire and interview.
