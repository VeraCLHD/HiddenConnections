A mixed-effects regression model was used to analyze the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and the progression of MCI, which was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Activities of Daily Living scale. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the association between intracranial arterial stenosis and dementia progression. RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up, 116 participants had progressed to dementia due to AD, while 223 remained in the MCI stage.
