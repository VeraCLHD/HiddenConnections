Both triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester (CE) concentrations were higher in the ER(-) cells, but the ability to synthesize CE distinguished the two types of breast cancer cells. Higher baseline, oleic acid- and LDL-stimulated CE concentrations were found in ER(-) compared to ER(+) cells. The differences corresponded to greater mRNA and protein levels of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), higher ACAT activity, higher caveolin-1 protein levels, greater LDL uptake, and lower de novo cholesterol synthesis in ER(-) cells.
