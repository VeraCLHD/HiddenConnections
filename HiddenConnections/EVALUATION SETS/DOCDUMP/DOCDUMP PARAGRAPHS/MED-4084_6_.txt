Results Over follow-up, 1226 hip fractures were identified in women and 490 in men. After controlling for known risk factors and current milk consumption, each additional glass of milk per day during teenage years was associated with a significant 9% higher risk of hip fracture in men (RR=1.09, 95% CI 1.01–1.17). The association was attenuated when height was added to the model (RR=1.06, 95% CI 0.98–1.14).
