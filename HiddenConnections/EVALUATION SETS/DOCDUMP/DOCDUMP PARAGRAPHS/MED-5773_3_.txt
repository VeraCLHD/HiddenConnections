After 84 days of exposure, the liver accumulated three times as much MeHg as the brain and white muscle. Vitamin C content and heme oxygenase, tubulin alpha (TUBA) and Cpt1 transcriptional levels all showed significant effects of MeHg exposure in the liver. TBARS, α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and the transcriptional levels of thioredoxin, heme oxygenase, TUBA, PPARB1, D5D and D6D showed an effect of dietary lipid composition in liver tissue.
