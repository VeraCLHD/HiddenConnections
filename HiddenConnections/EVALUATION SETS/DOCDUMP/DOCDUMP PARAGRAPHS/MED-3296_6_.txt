Results Mean GA was 33±2 weeks. Mean daily maternal estimated polyphenol intake (DMPI) was 1277mg, decreasing to 126mg after dietary orientation (p=0.0001). Significant decreases in systolic (SDV) and diastolic (DDV) ductal velocities, and RV/LV diameters ratio, as well as increase in ductal PI were observed [DSV=1.2±0.4m/s (0.7-1.6) to 0.9±0.3m/s (0.6-1.3) (p=0.018); DDV=0.21±0.09m/s (0.15-0.32) to 0.18±0.06m/s (0.11-0.25) (p=0.016); RV/LV ratio =1.3±0.2 (0.9-1.4) to 1.1±0.2 (0.8-1.3) (p=0.004); ductal PI=2.2±0.03 (2.0-2.7) to 2.4±0.4(2.2-2.9) (p=0.04)].
