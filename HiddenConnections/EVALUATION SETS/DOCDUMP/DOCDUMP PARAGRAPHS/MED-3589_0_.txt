Abstract Diverticular disease of the colon is a new disease that appeared at the beginning of this century. It is now the commonest disease of the colon in the Western world, being found in 1 in 3 people of over 60 years of age. The pathogenesis of the disease involves excessive segmentation, but this does not explain its aetiology.
