However, the plasma folate response of the pooled minced and liquefied spinach groups was greater than that of the whole-leaf spinach group (p = 0.03). Re-addition of dietary fibre to the liquefied spinach to compensate for the fibre broken down during liquefaction did not reduce the plasma folate response. The consumption of the carotenoid supplement did not have an effect on plasma folate concentrations compared with the control group.
