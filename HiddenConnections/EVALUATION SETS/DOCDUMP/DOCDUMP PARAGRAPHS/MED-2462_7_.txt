A 35% (p = 0.02) increase in postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels and a 54% (p = 0.02) increase in insulin levels were observed following RW consumption, compared to water. In conclusion, acute DRW consumption had no effect on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in dyslipidaemic postmenopausal women. However, the consumption of full-compliment RW exacerbated the postprandial lipaemic and insulin response over the 6-h period.
