RESULTS: During the almond feeding period, average body weight increased only 0.40 (kg) (p approximately 0.09). The weight change depended on baseline BMI (p = 0.05), and only those initially in the lower BMI tertiles experienced small and mainly unimportant weight gains with the almonds. We estimated that 54% (recalls) or 78% (diaries) of the extra energy from almonds was displaced by reductions in other foods.
