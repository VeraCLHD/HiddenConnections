Sight and smell of food without taste significantly (p<0.02) increased acid output above basal. Smell of food without sight or taste and sight of food without smell or taste did not significantly (p=0.06, p=0.34) increase acid output. In contrast with the effect on colonic pressures, sham feeding was the best stimulus of acid output.
