From there, they spread into adjoining areas and the hippocampus. Deposits eventually infiltrate all cortical areas, including densely myelinated primary fields of the neocortex (stages A-C). Intraneuronal lesions develop initially in the transentorhinal region, then spread in a predictable manner across other areas (stages I-VI).
