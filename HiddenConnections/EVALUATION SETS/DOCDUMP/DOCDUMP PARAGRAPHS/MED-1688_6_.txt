The OR for the joint exposure of tobacco smoking and low intake of vegetables and fruits was greater (3·86; 95 % CI 1·74, 8·57; P for trend < 0·001) compared with non-smokers with higher intake after adjusting for confounding variables and human papillomavirus status. Similar results were observed for total fruit, serum total carotene (including β-, α- and γ-carotene) and tocopherols. These findings suggest that the effect of nutritional factors on CIN3 is modified by smoking.
