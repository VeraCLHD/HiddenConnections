Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) is an emerging risk factor considered relevant in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which is implicated in the progression of CVD. Consumption of a diet rich in polyphenols may be cardioprotective through its impact on oxidative stress and protecting LDL from oxidation. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test the ability of strawberry phenolic compounds to mitigate the postprandial effects of a high-fat meal on OxLDL as well as investigate the effects of phenolic compounds on lipid metabolism.
