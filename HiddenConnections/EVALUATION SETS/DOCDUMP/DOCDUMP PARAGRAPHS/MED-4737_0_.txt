Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent literature on important topics in pediatric office practice: bullying, screening for the prediabetic state, and pediatric oral health. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature shows that bullying behaviors are common in children as young as kindergarten age, that there is a strong association between being a bully or victim and a range of psychosomatic and depressive symptoms in children, and that interventions including family therapy and school-based programs are effective for bullies and victims. Recent studies have further delineated glucose and insulin metabolism.
