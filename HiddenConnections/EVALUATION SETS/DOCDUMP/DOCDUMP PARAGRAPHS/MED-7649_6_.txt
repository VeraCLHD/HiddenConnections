Gel properties of mince obtained from lizardfish stored in ice for different times (0 to 10 d) with and without MTGase at a level 0.6 units/g were determined. Irrespective of MTGase addition, breaking force and deformation of all gels decreased as the storage time of lizardfish increased (P<0.05). The addition of MTGase was able to increase both breaking force and deformation of the resulting gel produced from lizardfish kept in ice for all storage times used.
