Abstract Total aluminum, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, and nickel were determined in black tea, green tea, Hibiscus sabdariffa, and Ilex paraguariensis (mate) by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry after nitric/perchloric acid digestion. In each case, one ground sample of commercially available leafy material was prepared and three 0.5-g subsamples were run in parallel. The infusions were also analyzed and the percentage of each element leached into the liquor was evaluated.
