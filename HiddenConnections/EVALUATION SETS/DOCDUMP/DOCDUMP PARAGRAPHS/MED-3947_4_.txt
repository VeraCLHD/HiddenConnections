Primary outcome data (the onset of a DSM-IV mood disorder) were collected from 112 participants; 56 per group. RESULTS: The incidence of mood disorder in the folic acid and placebo groups were 14.3% and 17.9% respectively, a non-significant difference. However, there was post-hoc evidence that folic acid delayed the time to onset of mood disorder in those participants who became unwell.
