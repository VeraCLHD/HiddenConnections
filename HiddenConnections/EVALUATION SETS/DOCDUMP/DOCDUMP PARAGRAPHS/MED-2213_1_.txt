Some clinicians believe that consumption of vitamin D is inadequate and, in turn, advocate vitamin D supplementation to increase serum levels of the nutrient. However, evidence concerning the role of vitamin D in health and disease is conflicting, and primary care physicians have little time to sort through the data and may find it difficult to advise their patients. To better understand the challenges that primary care physicians face regarding vitamin D, and to help inform those who provide guidance for clinical decision-making, the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, with co-sponsorship from other federal health agencies, held a conference titled Vitamin D: Moving Toward Evidence-based Decision Making in Primary Care in December 2014.
