We conclude that the RNAâˆ¶DNA heteroduplex is constrained by the telomerase TEN domain through repeated extension cycles and that the TEN domain controls the process by moving the template ahead one base at a time by translation and rotation of the double helix. The RNA region directly following the template can bind complementarily to the newly synthesized telomeric DNA, while the template itself is reused in the telomerase active site during the next reaction cycle. This first structural model of the human telomerase enzyme provides many details of the molecular mechanism of telomerase and immediately provides an important target for rational drug design.
