DESIGN: Twenty adults of both sexes, with mixed (M) or vegetarian (V) diets were studied. Data about the fat intake were obtained by means of a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and the presence of the main salivary fatty acids was determined by gas chromatography. RESULTS: A greater salivary concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) (2.82) was found in V than in M subjects (1.65) (p = 0.001), whilst arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) was lower in V (3.93) than in M (4.52) (p = 0.045).
