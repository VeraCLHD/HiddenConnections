Abstract The authors prospectively examined bowel movement frequency at baseline in relation to future Parkinson’s disease risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) during 2000–2006 (33,901 men) and the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) during 1982–2006 (93,767 women). During the follow-up (6 years for the HPFS and 24 years for the NHS), the authors identified 156 incident male Parkinson’s disease cases (HPFS) and 402 female cases (NHS). In the HPFS, compared with men with daily bowel movements, men with a bowel movement every 3 days or less had a multivariate-adjusted relative risk of 4.98 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.59, 9.57) for developing Parkinson’s disease in the next 6 years.
