RESULTS: Adherence to sunlight exposure was low (median adherence, 26%; IQR, 7%-45%). Serum 25OHD levels were low at baseline (median, 32.9 nmol/L) and increased only slightly depending on the number of sunlight sessions attended over 12 months (P = 0.04). During the study, 327 falls occurred in 111 (54%) subjects in the control group, 326 falls in 111 (58%) subjects in the UV only group and 335 falls in 108 (52%) subjects in the UV+ group.
