A total of twenty-four subjects, aged 30-70 years, completed the randomised, single-blind, controlled, crossover test meal study. Subjects consumed 400 ml of the FVPD, or a fruit-flavoured sugar-matched control, after following a low-flavonoid diet for 5 d. Blood and urine samples were collected throughout the study day, and vascular reactivity was assessed at 90 min intervals using laser Doppler iontophoresis. The FVPD significantly increased plasma vitamin C (P= 0·002) and total nitrate/nitrite (P= 0·001) concentrations.
