In both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects, IL-18 concentrations increased and adiponectin concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) from baseline concentrations after consumption of the high-fat meal. After consumption of the high-carbohydrate, high-fiber meal, serum IL-18 concentrations decreased from baseline concentrations (P < 0.05) in both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects; adiponectin concentrations decreased after the high-carbohydrate, low-fiber meal in diabetic patients. IL-8 concentrations did not change significantly after consumption of any of the 3 meals.
