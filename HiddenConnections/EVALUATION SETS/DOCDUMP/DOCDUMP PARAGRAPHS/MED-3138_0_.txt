Abstract Blood-injury-injection (BII) phobia presents with a unique anxiety response that often involves blood pressure drops and pronounced bradycardia, which can culminate in fainting. The current recommended treatment for BII phobia is Applied Tension (AT), a tension technique that includes in vivo exposure. However, surprisingly little empirical evidence is available on the additive efficacy of tension beyond exposure alone.
