Daily output of urinary ammonia, urea, phenols, and total nitrogen did not change significantly, but pH decreased from 6.4 +/- 0.1 to 6.2 +/- 0.1 (P < 0.05) during the high-RS period. These results suggest that RS significantly attenuates the accumulation of potentially harmful byproducts of protein fermentation in the human colon.
