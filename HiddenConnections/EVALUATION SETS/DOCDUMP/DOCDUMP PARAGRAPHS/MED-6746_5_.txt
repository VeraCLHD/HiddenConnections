Subjects with advanced periodontal disease had lower flow-mediated dilation compared with control patients (7.8+/-4.6% versus 11.7+/-5.3%, P=0.005). Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation was equivalent in the two groups. Subjects with advanced periodontitis exhibited higher serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein compared with healthy controls patients (2.3+/-2.3 versus 1.0+/-1.0 mg/L, P=0.03).
