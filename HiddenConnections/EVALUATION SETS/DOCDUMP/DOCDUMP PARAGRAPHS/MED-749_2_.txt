METHODS: Forty patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized into two groups: the first consumed 4 cups of coffee/day for 30 days, while the second remained coffee "abstinent". At day 30, the groups were switched over for a second month. RESULTS: At baseline, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were lower in patients drinking 3-5 (Group B) than 0-2 cups/day (Group A) (56 ± 6 vs 74 ± 11/60 ± 3 vs 73 ± 7 U/L p=0.05/p=0.04, respectively).
