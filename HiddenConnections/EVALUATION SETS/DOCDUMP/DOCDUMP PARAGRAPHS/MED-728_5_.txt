Similarly, there are differences in mTOR function that reflect the tissue of origin. In this review, we present an alternative view to mTOR complex formation and function, which envisions mTOR regulation and signal propagation as a reflection of cell type- and basal state-dependent conditions. The re-interpretation of mTOR biology in this framework may facilitate the design of therapies most likely to effectively inhibit this central regulator of cell behavior.
