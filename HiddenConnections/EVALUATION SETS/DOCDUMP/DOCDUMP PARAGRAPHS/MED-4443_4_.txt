We assessed antiplatelet activity ex vivo and bleeding time in rats that ingested 0.1 and 1.0â€‰g/kg of pomace each day. In studies in vitro, no significant differences in antiplatelet activity was observed in fresh tomato hybrids. Furthermore, the agro-industrial process did not affect the antiplatelet activity of paste and pomace.
