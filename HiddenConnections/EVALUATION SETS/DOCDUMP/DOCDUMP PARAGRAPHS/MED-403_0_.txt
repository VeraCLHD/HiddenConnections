Abstract Objective To relate dietary fat types to cognitive change in healthy community-based elders. Methods Among 6,183 older participants in the Womenâ€™s Health Study, we related intake of major fatty acids (FAs) (saturated [SFA], mono-unsaturated [MUFA], total poly-unsaturated [PUFA], trans-unsaturated) to late-life cognitive trajectory. Serial cognitive testing, conducted over 4 years, began 5 years post-dietary assessment.
