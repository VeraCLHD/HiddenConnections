Total body zinc content (2.6 mg/100 g live body weight) measured chemically was about 9 times higher than estimates of exchangeable zinc in the body. Whole-body retention of 65Zn was higher and endogenous fecal zinc excretion was lower in rats fed phytate than in those fed the basal diet; these responses to phytate may reflect a homeostatic adjustment to decreased absorption of zinc. Respective values for apparent absorption and true absorption of zinc were 13 and 32% of zinc intake in rats fed phytate, and 19 and 46% of zinc intake in rats fed the basal diet.
