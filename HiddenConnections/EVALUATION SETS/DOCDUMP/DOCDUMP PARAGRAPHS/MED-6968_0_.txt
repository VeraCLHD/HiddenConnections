Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although age, genetics, and sex steroid hormones play prominent roles in the cause of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), recent epidemiological studies suggest that modifiable lifestyle factors also contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of these conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Lifestyle and metabolic factors associated with significantly increased risks of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms include obesity, diabetes, and meat and fat consumption. Factors associated with decreased risks include physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, and vegetable consumption.
