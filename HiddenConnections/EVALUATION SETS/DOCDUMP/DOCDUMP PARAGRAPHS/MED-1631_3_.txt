Question form included a list of 65 food items formed from five main food groups (grain, meat and alternatives, dairy products, vegetables-fruits and fat) and 25 dietary habits. The data were evaluated by binary logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Student's t, Mann-Whitney, and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: When both groups compared, black tea consumptions (GI-700ml; GII-1600ml (OR: 0.635, P<0.001)), vegetable fruits scores (GI-54.30; GII-63.81 (OR: 0.863, P<0.001)), regularly breakfast habit (GI-24 patients; GII-36 cases (OR: 0.549, P<0.001)) and eating salty (GI-22 patients; GII-5 cases (P<0.001)) made significant differences.
