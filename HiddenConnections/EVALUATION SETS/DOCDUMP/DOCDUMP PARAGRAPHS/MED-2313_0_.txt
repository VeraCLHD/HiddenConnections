Abstract Three major sources of flavonoids and phenolic compounds, which are commonly used in food industry, namely loquat leaf (LL), grape skin (GS) and acai puree, were tested in regard to their potential anti-atherosclerotic and anti-diabetic activity. The compounds were evaluated by in vitro antioxidant assay using a macrophage model and for in vivo hypolipidemic activity using zebrafish. In assays in vitro, all extracts demonstrated potent ferric ion reductive capacity, radical-scavenging activity and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml.
