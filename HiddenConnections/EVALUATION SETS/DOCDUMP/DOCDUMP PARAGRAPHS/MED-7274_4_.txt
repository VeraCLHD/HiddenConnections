Endothelial function assessed by FMD has been shown to be affected by cardiovascular risk factors, to be related to structural arterial disease and to cardiovascular outcome, validating its use for studying the pathophysiology of arterial disease. Numerous studies have also demonstrated that it is responsive to physiological and pharmacological interventions. Flow-mediated dilatation provides unique opportunities in drug development programmes to assess an early rapidly responsive signal of risk or benefit, complementing endpoints of structural arterial disease and cardiovascular outcomes that take much longer and are more expensive.
