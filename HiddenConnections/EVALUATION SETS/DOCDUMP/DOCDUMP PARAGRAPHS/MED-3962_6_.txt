MRSA was primarily isolated from nasal swabs with 8 (31%) carcasses testing positive at postbleed, which increased to 14 (54%) positive at postscald tanks. Only one carcass (sampled at postbleed) tested positive for MRSA, with no recovery of the pathogen from environmental samples taken. C. difficile ribotype 078 predominated in the longitudinal portion of the study, accounting for all of the 68 isolates recovered from pigs.
