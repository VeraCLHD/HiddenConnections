We found that yerba mate extract induced a concentration-dependent, statistically significant increase in the level of apoptotic and necrotic cells and a decrease in the nuclear division index (NDI). Mate-exposed lymphocytes had a reduced transcriptional rDNA activity, which may be due to the stress conditions, and showed an elevated production of micronuclei. The FISH technique revealed the appearance of an acrocentric signal in mate-induced micronuclei, which suggests that under these conditions yerba mate extract may display aneugenic activity.
