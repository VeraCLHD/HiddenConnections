The increment in 2 h serum triglyceride level correlated positively with the decrement in postprandial flow-mediated vasodilatation (r = 0.459, P < 0.01). Postprandial triglyceride level was significantly higher in CAD patients than in control participants. Flow-mediated vasodilatation was significantly impaired in CAD patients (from 3.04 +/- 0.39 to 1.69 +/- 0.23%, P < 0.01) and control participants (from 6.58 +/- 0.52 to 4.87 +/- 0.19%, P < 0.05) after a high-fat meal.
