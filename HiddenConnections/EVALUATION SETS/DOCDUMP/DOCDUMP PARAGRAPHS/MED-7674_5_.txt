Reduction of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 protein release from both the cultured cell line and peritoneal cells was further confirmed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays. Rice bran from the LK1-3-6-12-1-1 cultivar was the most effective inhibitor in all assays. This particular rice variety merits further evaluation as part of a human diet to ascertain its potential to protect against allergic diseases such as hay fever and asthma.
