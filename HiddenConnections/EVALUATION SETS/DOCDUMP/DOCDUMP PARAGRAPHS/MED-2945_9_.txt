Similarly, elevated midlife values for serum total cholesterol level (odds ratio, 2.8 [CI, 1.2 to 6.7]) and systolic blood pressure (odds ratio, 2.6 [CI, 1.1 to 6.6]) were independent risk factors for Alzheimer disease, even after adjustment for apoE genotype and other confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the apoE epsilon4 allele and Alzheimer disease does not seem to be mediated by vascular factors. The apoE epsilon4 allele, elevated midlife total cholesterol level, and high midlife systolic blood pressure are independent risk factors for Alzheimer disease.
