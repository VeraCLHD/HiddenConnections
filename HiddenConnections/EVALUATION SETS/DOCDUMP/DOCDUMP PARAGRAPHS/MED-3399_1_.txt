An extrinsic reference method was used to estimate the mass of carotenes and vitamin A derived from various preparations made from the same lot of carrots. Using a repeated-measures design, nine healthy adult subjects consumed test meals of either carrot puree (commercial baby food) or boiled-mashed carrots on separate days; six of the subjects also consumed a test meal of raw-grated carrot. Test meals supplied 34.7 micromol (18.6 mg) carrot beta-carotene (beta C), plus 6 micromol deuterium-labeled retinyl acetate (d(4)-RA) in oil solution.
