Using our model, we estimated that there were 1.4 million nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in the United States, resulting in 168,000 physician office visits per year during 1996-1999. Including both culture-confirmed infections and those not confirmed by culture, we estimated that Salmonella infections resulted in 15,000 hospitalizations and 400 deaths annually. These estimates indicate that salmonellosis presents a major ongoing burden to public health.
