In assays in vitro, all extracts demonstrated potent ferric ion reductive capacity, radical-scavenging activity and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Extracts could also abrogate fructose-mediated protein glycation and mildly inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Cellular uptake of oxidized or acetylated LDL into macrophages was inhibited by acai treatment (final concentration, 0.1 mg/ml) and moderately diminished by GS and LL extracts.
