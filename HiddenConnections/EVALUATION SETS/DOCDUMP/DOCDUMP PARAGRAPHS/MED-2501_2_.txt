Furthermore, there is increasing evidence for additional blood pressure-independent pathways linking excess salt intake to the process of atherosclerosis. Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials showed that moderate reduction of salt intake is associated with reduction of blood pressure and, in perspective, with reduction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in hypertensive individuals. According to the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) guidelines for the management of hypertension, instructions to reduce dietary salt intake to the level of 5 g/day based on the WHO recommendation should be provided to all patients, regardless of their requirement for drug treatment.
