Breast cancer risk was also inversely associated with enterolignan exposure (4 studies; RE: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) but not with blood or urine enterolactone concentrations. The associations were not significantly different between ER-status subgroups (6 studies). CONCLUSIONS: High lignan exposure may be associated with a reduced breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women.
