The high-carbohydrate meal did not modify blood pressure, and platelet aggregation decreased in response to the L-arginine load (-7.1 +/- 2.3 mm Hg and -8.5 +/- 4.5%, respectively). After the high-fat meal, the decrease in blood pressure in response to L-arginine was reduced (-1 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), and platelet aggregation showed a paradoxical increase (4.1 +/- 2.1%; P < 0.01 compared with the high-carbohydrate meal). The high-fat meal with antioxidants partially restored the vascular response to L-arginine.
