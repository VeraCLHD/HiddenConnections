Age-adjusted HR of all-cause mortality for the group with 6 healthy lifestyle factors was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.32-0.56) among men and 0.49 (0.39-0.60) among women, respectively, compared with the group with 0-2 healthy lifestyle factors. Even at ages 60-79 years, a healthy lifestyle has a major impact on mortality. Had the subjects achieved even a 1-point increment in their lifestyle scores, death rates of 24.7% among men and 18.5% among women could have been reduced.
