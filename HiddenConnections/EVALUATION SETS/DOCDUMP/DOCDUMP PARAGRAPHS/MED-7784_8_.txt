In response to reactive hyperaemia after cuff deflation, the endothelium-dependent dilation was significantly different between the meals. There was a marked decrease in endothelium-dependent dilation after the WHF meal compared to the LF meal (8.6 +/- 2.2% vs. -0.8 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.006). There was also a marked decrease in endothelium-dependent dilation after the LHF meal compared to the LF meal (7.7 +/- 2.1% vs. -0.8 +/- 1.1%, P < 0.001).
