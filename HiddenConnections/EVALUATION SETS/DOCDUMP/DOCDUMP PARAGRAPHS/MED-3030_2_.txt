The North American Caucasians were found to have a flora composition intermediate between these two groups. Fifteen bacterial taxa from the human fecal flora were significantly associated with high risk of colon cancer, and five were significantly associated with low risk of colon cancer. Total concentrations of Bacteroides species and, surprisingly, Bifidobacterium species were generally positively associated with increased risk of colon cancer.
