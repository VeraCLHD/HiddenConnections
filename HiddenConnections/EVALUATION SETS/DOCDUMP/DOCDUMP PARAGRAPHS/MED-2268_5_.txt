RESULTS: Five studies were included in our analysis of the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened soda and CKD. The pooled RR of CKD in patients consuming sugar-sweetened soda was 1.58 (95% CI 1.00-2.49). Four studies were selected to assess the association between consumption of artificially sweetened soda and CKD.
