Previous MI, CAD and HyperT often occur in and may increase the risk of AD. Expression of Apo-E4 likely increases risk of CAD by elevating blood cholesterol and the risk of AD via proposed interactions with beta-amyloid and/or free radicals (FRs). Any Apo-E4 effect is vague, but FRs probably mediate vascular damage in HyperT.
