The association was concentrated to women under 50 years of age. The relative risk for these women was 1.74 (95% CI 1.13–2.68), whereas it was 0.97 (95% CI 0.59–1.58) for older women. The relative risk in the younger age-group was 1.47 (95% CI 0.73–2.97) during the first 10 years of follow-up, and 1.93 (95% CI 1.11–3.37) for follow-up times longer than 10 years.
