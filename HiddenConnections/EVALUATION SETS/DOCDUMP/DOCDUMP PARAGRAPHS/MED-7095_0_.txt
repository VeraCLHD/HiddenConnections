Abstract We have compared the effects of dietary soy protein and casein in diets low in cholesterol (less than 100 mg/d) and in diets enriched in cholesterol (500 mg/d) to examine whether the level of cholesterol intake affects the response of plasma lipoproteins to dietary proteins of plant and animal origin. Normal men and women consumed formula diets containing 20% of calories as soy protein or casein, 27% as fat and 53% as carbohydrate in 2 crossover studies. The dietary periods lasted for 31 days and were separated by a month-long interim period on self-chosen food.
