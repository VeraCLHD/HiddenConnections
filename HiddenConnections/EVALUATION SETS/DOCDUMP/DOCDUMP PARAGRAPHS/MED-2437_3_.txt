Processed meat products comprise one of the major sources of sodium in the form of sodium chloride (salt). Salt has an essential function in meat products in terms of flavour, texture and shelf-life. Apart from lowering the level of salt added to products there are a number of approaches to reduce the sodium content in processed foods including the use of salt substitutes, in particular, potassium chloride (KCl) in combination with masking agents, the use of flavour enhancers which enhance the saltiness of products when used with salt and finally optimising the physical form of salt so that it becomes more functional and taste bioavailable.
