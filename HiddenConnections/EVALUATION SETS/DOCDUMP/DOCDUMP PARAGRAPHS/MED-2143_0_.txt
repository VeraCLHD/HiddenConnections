Abstract Because solar UV-radiation represents the most important environmental risk factor for the development of non-melanoma skin cancer, UV protection is important to prevent these malignancies. Consequently, public health campaigns were developed to improve the knowledge of the general population regarding the role of UV-radiation for the development of skin cancer. However, it has to be noted that vitamin D-mediated positive effects of UV light were not adequately considered in most of these campaigns, that often propose a strict 'no sun policy' without giving recommendations how to prevent vitamin D-deficiency.
