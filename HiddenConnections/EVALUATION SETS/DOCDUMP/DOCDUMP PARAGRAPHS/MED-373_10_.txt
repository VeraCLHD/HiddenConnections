Twenty-three (62%) men and seven (50%) women had significant disc degeneration. Disc degeneration was associated with occluded lumbar/middle sacral arteries (P = 0.035). Patients with occluded arteries or significant disc degeneration did not complain more severe symptoms than those without, whereas patients with above normal serum LDL cholesterol scored higher in neurogenic symptoms (P = 0.031) and complained more often severe pain (P = 0.049) than those with normal LDL cholesterol.
