In contrast, CpG island methylation of RARB M4 (P = 0.051), INK4a/ARF (P = 0.042), HIN-1 (P = 0.044), and PRA (P = 0.032), as well as the overall frequency of methylation events (P = 0.004), was associated with abnormal Masood cytology. The association between promoter methylation and familial breast cancer was tested in 40 unaffected premenopausal women in our cohort who underwent BRCA1/2 mutation testing. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations had a low frequency of CpG island promoter methylation (15 of 15 women had â‰¤4 methylation events), whereas women without a mutation showed a high frequency of promoter methylation events (24 of 25 women had 5-8 methylation events; P < 0.0001).
