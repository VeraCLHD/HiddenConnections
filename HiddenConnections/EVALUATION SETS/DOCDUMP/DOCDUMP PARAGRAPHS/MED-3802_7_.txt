Previous studies showed the causes of olfactory impairments in PD and AD patients were attributable to pathological changes and MRI signal abnormalities in limbic areas, including the amygdala (AMG), entorhinal cortex (ENT), hippocampus (HI), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Another study reported that DM1 patients have bilateral lesions in anterior temporal areas, including the subcortical white matter, AMG, ENT and insula. Our findings underscore the need to pay careful attention to significant decreases of odor identification abilities caused by diverse forms of abnormal brain function, especially in the AMG, ENT and HI.
