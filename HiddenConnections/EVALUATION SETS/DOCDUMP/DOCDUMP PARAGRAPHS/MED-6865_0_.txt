Abstract Various methods have been described in the literature for the detection of virulent Yersinia enterocolitica in pigs. The risk factors for pig herd contamination have yet to be determined. The objective of this study was to validate a sensitive method for the detection of Y. enterocolitica and to describe the distribution of the bacteria in pigs at slaughter from conventional and alternative ("organic") housing systems.
