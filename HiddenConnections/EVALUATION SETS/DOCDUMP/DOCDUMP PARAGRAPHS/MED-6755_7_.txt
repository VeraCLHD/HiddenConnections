RESULTS: Among the selected vasculogenic patients with ED, mild-to-moderate vasculogenic ED showed the highest prevalence, whereas prevalence for CP among all vasculogenic patients with ED was highest among severe ED (81.8%). Association of CP and vasculogenic ED was found to be correlated positively, but it showed no statistical significance. Two of five patients were found to have vascular insufficiency.
