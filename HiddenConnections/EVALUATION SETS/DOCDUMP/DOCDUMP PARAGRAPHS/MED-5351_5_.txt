Both a caspase-8 and broad-based caspase inhibitor, but not a caspase-9 specific inhibitor, suppressed curcumin-induced cell death. To further support our hypothesis that curcumin induces activation of a death receptor pathway, we show that curcumin induces Fas receptor aggregation in a FasL-independent manner and that low-temperature incubation, previously shown to inhibit receptor aggregation, prevented curcumin-induced cell death. Moreover, we demonstrate that expression of dominant negative FADD significantly inhibited curcumin-induced cell death.
