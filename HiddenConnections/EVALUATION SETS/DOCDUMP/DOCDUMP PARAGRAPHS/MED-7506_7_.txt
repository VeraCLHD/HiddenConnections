These TEQ values include the 17 dioxin and furan congeners and 3 coplanar PCBs, and were generated substituting ND=(1/2)DL or ND=DL/sq rt (2). Results are provided for ND=0 and analyses conducted to evaluate the impacts of this substitution. A more detailed examination of beef and pork data from similarly designed national statistical surveys show that declines in pork are statistically significant while the beef concentrations appeared to have remained constant between the time periods.
