In adults, elevated BPA concentrations are associated with cardiovascular disease. BPA exposure is plausibly linked to atherosclerosis in adolescents and young adults, but evidence is lacking to date. METHODS: We recruited 886 subjects (12-30 years of age) from a population-based sample of adolescents and young adults based on a mass urine screening to determine the relationship between serum levels of BPA and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).
