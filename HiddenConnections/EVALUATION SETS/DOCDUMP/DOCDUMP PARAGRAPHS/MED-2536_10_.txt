In utero and early-life exposures and possible transgenerational effects are not well understood. However, considering the current evidence, reducing exposures to phthalates by avoiding processed and foods packaged and stored in plastics, personal care products with phthalates, polyvinyl chloride materials indoors, and reducing home dust is advised. Further longitudinal, molecular, and intervention studies are needed to understand the association between phthalates and allergic disease.
