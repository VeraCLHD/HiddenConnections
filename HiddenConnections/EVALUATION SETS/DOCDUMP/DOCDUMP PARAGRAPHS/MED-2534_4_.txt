DCHP stimulated cell proliferation with maximal cell yield at 5 x 10(-5) M. Its estrogenic potency was approximately 1700000 times less than that of 17beta-estradiol. DEHP and BBP stimulated cell proliferation only slightly at >10(-3) M. No other phthalate diesters or monoesters tested were estrogenic. Anti-estrogenic activities were also examined by estimating the suppression of cell proliferation in the presence of 10(-11) M 17beta-estradiol.
