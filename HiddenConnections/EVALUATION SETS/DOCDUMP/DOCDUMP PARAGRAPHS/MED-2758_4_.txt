Recent efficacy and safety data favour lower over higher doses of colchicine, and oral corticosteroids over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with acute gout.

Several other drugs with rational mechanisms of action are in the pipeline, and likely to be introduced over the next few years.
