Males had higher animal and plant protein intakes than females (P < 0·001). Legume and soya protein intakes were low in the whole population (0·101 and 0·174 g/d, respectively). In males, animal protein intake was positively associated with BMI (β = 0·013; P = 0·001) and waist circumference (WC; β = 0·041; P = 0·002).
