Because naive T cells produce only IL-2 in short term culture, IFN-gamma production by this approach is a measure of a memory immune response. Stimulation of human PBLs or purified T lymphocytes with stimulator cells from inbred swine revealed a high frequency of IFN-gamma producers with 5-fold fewer IL-2 producers. In contrast, lymphocytes obtained from neonatal umbilical cord blood contained swine-specific IL-2 producers but few IFN-gamma producers, which is what one would expect to find with a naive phenotype.
