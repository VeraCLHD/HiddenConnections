Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically examine the action of strawberries in preventing platelet activation and thrombus formation. Strawberry extract concentration-dependently (0.1-1 mg/ml) inhibited platelet aggregation induced by ADP and arachidonic acid. At the same concentrations as strawberry inhibits platelet aggregation, it significantly decreased sP-selectin, sCD40L, RANTES, and IL-1β levels.
