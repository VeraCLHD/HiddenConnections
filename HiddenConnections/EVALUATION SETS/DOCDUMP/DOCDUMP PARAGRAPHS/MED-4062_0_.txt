Abstract BACKGROUND: Rice consumption has been associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, but its relation with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is limited. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between rice consumption and risk of CVD incidence and mortality in a Japanese population. DESIGN: This was a prospective study in 91,223 Japanese men and women aged 40-69 y in whom rice consumption was determined and updated from 3 self-administered food-frequency questionnaires, each 5 y apart.
