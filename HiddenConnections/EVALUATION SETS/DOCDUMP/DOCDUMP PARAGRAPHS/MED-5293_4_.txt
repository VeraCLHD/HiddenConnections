This heat- and acid-stable substance is present in high concentration in many food items, including cereal grains, nuts, and seeds. Phytic acid forms chelates with various metals and suppresses damaging iron-catalyzed redox reactions. Inasmuch as colonic bacteria have been shown to produce oxygen radicals in appreciable amounts, dietary phytic acid might suppress oxidant damage to intestinal epithelium and neighboring cells.
