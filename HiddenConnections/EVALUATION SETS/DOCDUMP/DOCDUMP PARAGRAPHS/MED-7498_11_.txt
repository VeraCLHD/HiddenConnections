Administration of PCB-77 increased body weight gain in WT but not AhR−/− mice. ApoE−/− mice injected with PCB-77 exhibited greater body weight, adipocyte hypertrophy, serum dyslipidemia, and augmented atherosclerosis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that PCB-77 may contribute to the development of obesity and obesity-associated atherosclerosis.
