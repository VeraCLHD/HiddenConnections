Abstract Senescent T-cells accumulate with age, lowering the na√Øve T-cell repertoire and increasing host infection risk. As this response is likely to be influenced by certain lifestyle factors, we examined the association between aerobic fitness (VO(2max)) and the age-related accumulation of senescent T-cells. Blood lymphocytes from 102 healthy males (18-61 yr) were analyzed for KLRG1, CD57, CD28, CD45RA, CD45RO surface expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells by 4-color flow cytometry.
