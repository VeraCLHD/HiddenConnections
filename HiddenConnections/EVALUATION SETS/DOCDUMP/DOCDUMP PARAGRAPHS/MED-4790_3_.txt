METHODS: Lists of response genes were analysed with bioinformatics programs to identify common biological pathways induced in vivo as well as in vitro. Furthermore, overlapping genes and pathways were evaluated for possible involvement in the biological processes induced in vivo by datamining and consulting literature. RESULTS: For all three interventions, only a limited number of identical genes and a few common biological processes/pathways were found to be affected by the respective interventions.
