METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE search (1 January 1995 to 31 December 2009) of original studies reporting data on major congenital malformations in women with gestational diabetes and a reference group. Information on pregestational diabetes was collected when available. Two investigators considered studies for inclusion and extracted data; discrepancies were solved by consensus.
