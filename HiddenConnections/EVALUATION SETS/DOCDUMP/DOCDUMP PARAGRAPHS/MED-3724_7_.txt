MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Net differences in systolic and diastolic BP associated with the consumption of vegetarian diets were assessed. RESULTS Of the 258 studies identified, 7 clinical trials and 32 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. In the 7 controlled trials (a total of 311 participants; mean age, 44.5 years), consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with a reduction in mean systolic BP (-4.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -6.6 to -3.1; P < .001; I2 = 0; P = .45 for heterogeneity) and diastolic BP (-2.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, -3.5 to -1.0; P < .001; I2 = 0; P = .43 for heterogeneity) compared with the consumption of omnivorous diets.
