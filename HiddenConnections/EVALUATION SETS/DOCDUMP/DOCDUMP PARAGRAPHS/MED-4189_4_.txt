SIRT1 mRNA and its translated protein correlated negatively with the duration of symptoms (mRNA: r2 = −0.367; protein: r2 = −0.326) and the accumulation of paired helical filament tau (mRNA: r2 = −0.230; protein: r2 = −0.119), but weakly with insoluble amyloid-β(Aβ42 (mRNA: r2 = −0.090; protein: r2 = −0.072). A significant relationship between SIRT1 levels and global cognition scores proximate to death was also found (r2 = +0.09; p = 0.049). In contrast, cortical SIRT1 levels remained unchanged in a triple-transgenic animal model of AD.
