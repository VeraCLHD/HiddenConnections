Therefore, the present experiment was designed to evaluate the performance, carcass traits, hematology and serum biochemical parameters of broilers fed ration containing varying levels of Lepidium satvium (Garden cress) seed powder as feed additive up to the age of 42 days. METHODS: A total of 204 Cobb-500 day-old broiler chicks were randomly distributed into four treatments with three replicates of 17 chicks each. Garden cress (GC) was included in the ration at 0 (0GC), 0.75 (0.75GC), 1.50 (1.5GC) and 2.25 % (2.25GC) in each treatments.
