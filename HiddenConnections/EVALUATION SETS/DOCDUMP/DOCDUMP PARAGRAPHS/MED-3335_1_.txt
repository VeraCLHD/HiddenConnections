Puréed F&V products retain many beneficial components, including flavonoids, carotenoids, vitamin C and dietary fibres. The present study aimed to establish the physiological effects of acute ingestion of a F&V purée-based drink (FVPD) on vasodilation, antioxidant status, phytochemical bioavailability and other CVD risk factors. A total of twenty-four subjects, aged 30-70 years, completed the randomised, single-blind, controlled, crossover test meal study.
