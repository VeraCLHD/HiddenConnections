CER is a proapoptotic signal and CER levels were increased in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by individual treatment with SIT and TAM and the combined treatment raised cellular CER content even further. SIT and TAM raised CER levels by different means. SIT potently activated de novo CER synthesis in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by stimulating serine palmitoyltransferase activity; whereas TAM promoted CER accumulation in both cell types by inhibiting CER glycosylation.
