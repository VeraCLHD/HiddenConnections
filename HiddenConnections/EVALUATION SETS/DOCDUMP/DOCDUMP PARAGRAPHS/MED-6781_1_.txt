The most abundant HCA found in the human diet is 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP). PhIP causes mammary carcinomas in female rats and mice, and is associated with an increased risk of developing colon, breast, and prostate cancer in humans. PhIP is metabolized by cytochrome P-450s producing N-OH-PhIP.
