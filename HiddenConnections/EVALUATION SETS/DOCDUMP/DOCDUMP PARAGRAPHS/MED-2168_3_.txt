DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 192 elderly individuals (mean age, 69.9 yr). MEASURES: We measured ambulatory daylight exposure using a wrist light meter in two 48-h sessions; furthermore, we measured overnight urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, an index of melatonin secretion, on the second night of each session. RESULTS: The median duration of daylight exposure of at least 1000 lux was 72 min (interquartile range, 37-124).
