Before and after completion of each diet, IMCL levels and insulin sensitivity were assessed. After the high-fat diet, IMCL levels increased significantly in TA muscle (to 148.0 +/- 16.9% of baseline; P = 0.005), but not in SOL muscle (to 114.4 +/- 8.2% of baseline; NS). Insulin sensitivity decreased to 83.3 +/- 5.6% of baseline (P = 0.033).
