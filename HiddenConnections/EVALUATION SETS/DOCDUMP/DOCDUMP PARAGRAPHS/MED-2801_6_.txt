The comparison of cases with different congenital abnormalities and malformed controls (including offspring with Down syndrome) as referent, indicated a higher prevalence of the common cold during the second and third month of gestation only in the mothers of cases with cleft lip+/-palate (adjusted POR: 1.7 with 95% CI: 1.2-2.5), however, congenital hydrocephaly, neural-tube defects and multiple CAs had also mothers with a somewhat higher occurrence of the common cold. The possible association between the common cold during early pregnancy and the above mentioned congenital abnormalities may be connected mainly with the indirect effect of secondary complications of maternal common cold, particularly high fever because antifever drugs were able to prevent the possible teratogenic effect of the common cold.
