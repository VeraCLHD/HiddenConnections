The slight excess mortality in smokers without IPD, versus nonsmokers without IPD, appeared insufficient to account for the "missing" incident IPD cases in smokers. These IPD incidence and mortality data are not highly consistent with the "selective mortality" hypothesis, which attributes reduced prior smoking frequency, typically reported by persons with IPD, to accelerated mortality in undiagnosed IPD-affected persons who smoke. The "protective" association of cigarette smoking with IPD occurrence may thus be real, suggesting the need for further study of biologic mechanisms of protection.
