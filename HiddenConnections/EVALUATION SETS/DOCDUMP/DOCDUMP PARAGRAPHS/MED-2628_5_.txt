RESULTS: Compliance with the intervention was corroborated by significant dose-dependent increases in the proportions of EPA and DHA in erythrocyte lipids and a 16.5% reduction in serum triacylglycerol concentrations with 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs/d. FMD was lower in men than in women (P < 0.0001) and decreased with age (ρ = 0.270, P < 0.001) but was not significantly (P = 0.781) related to n-3 LC-PUFA intake. The mean changes in FMD (95% CIs) compared with placebo were 0.1% (-0.9%, 1.1%), -0.3% (-1.3%, 0.6%), and -0.3% (-1.3%, 0.7%) with daily intakes of 0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 g n-3 LC-PUFAs, respectively.
