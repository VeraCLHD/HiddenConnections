This study aimed to determine the association between protein intake and obesity. A cohort of 1,730 employed white men ages 40–55 years from the Chicago Western Electric Study was followed from 1958 to 1966. Diet was assessed twice with Burke’s comprehensive diet history method, at two baseline examinations; height, weight, and other covariates were measured annually by trained interviewers.
