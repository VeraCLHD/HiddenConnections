Here, we report a 63-year-old patient with overt hypothyroidism that developed due to habitual gargling with povidone iodine for more than 10 years. The urinary excretion of iodine was estimated to be greater than 5 mg/day, based on values obtained from 18 normal subjects who gargled three times a day (4.6+/-2.1 mg, mean+/-SD). After discontinuation of the gargling, the patient has been euthyroid for more than 10 months.
