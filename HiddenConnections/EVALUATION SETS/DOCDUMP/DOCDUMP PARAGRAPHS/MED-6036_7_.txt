The relative risk was significantly higher for some job categories. A significant correlation was observed between REV and ALSV antibody levels, which was strong among poultry workers, but weak among the control subjects. CONCLUSION: Antibody levels can be validly used to identify certain job tasks associated with high risk of exposure to REV in the workplace, and the practical implication is recommendations for protection at these job tasks.
