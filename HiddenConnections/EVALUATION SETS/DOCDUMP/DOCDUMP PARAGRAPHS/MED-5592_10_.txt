Risk of major congenital malformations was much higher in offspring of women with PGDM than in those of the reference group: RR 2.66 (2.04-3.47) in cohort studies and OR 4.7 (3.01-6.95) in the single case control study providing information. CONCLUSION: There is a slightly higher risk of major congenital malformations in women with gestational diabetes than in the reference group. The contribution of women with overt hyperglycemia and other factors could not be ascertained.
