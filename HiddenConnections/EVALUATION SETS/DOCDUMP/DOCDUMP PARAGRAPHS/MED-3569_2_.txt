Four drinks were investigated: (i) 200 ml, 12 degrees C, (ii) 200 ml, 37 degrees C, (iii) 500 ml, 12 degrees C, (iv) 500 ml, 37 degrees C. Gastric emptying was measured by real-time ultrasound. 2. After an initial rapid phase of emptying, measured by the volume retained in the stomach at 5 min, emptying was mono-exponential and measured as a half-life.
