The extent of inhibition of these 2 markers of the immune response was accompanied by an influx of calcium ions. The inhibition of the immune process by the pigmented brans was confirmed by the observed modulation of the proinflammatory cytokine gene expressions and cytokine release, as indicated by the reduction in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, and IL-6 mRNA expressions determined with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Reduction of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 protein release from both the cultured cell line and peritoneal cells was further confirmed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays.
