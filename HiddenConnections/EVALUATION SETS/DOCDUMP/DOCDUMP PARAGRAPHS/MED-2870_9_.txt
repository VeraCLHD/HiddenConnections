Their absorption spectra cover the UVB and UVA range, respectively, thus potentially contributing to photoprotective effects of carotenoid-rich food. Because of the physiologic turnover time of skin, several weeks are required for protective effects to appear. Photoprotection through individual dietary components such as Î²-carotene or lycopene in terms of sun protection factor is considerably lower than that achieved by using topical sunscreens.
