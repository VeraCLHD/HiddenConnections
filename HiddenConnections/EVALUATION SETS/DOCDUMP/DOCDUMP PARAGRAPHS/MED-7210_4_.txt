However it decreased cell death in C-28/I2 chondrocytes exposed to stimuli previously reported to promptly trigger apoptosis, that is, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF) plus cycloheximide (CHX) or the polyamine analogue N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine (DENSPM) plus CHX. In particular pre-treatment with SFN reduced effector and initiator caspase activities and the associated activation of JNK kinases. SFN exerted a cytoprotective action even versus H(2)O(2) , which differently from the previous stimuli induced cell death without producing an evident caspase activation.
