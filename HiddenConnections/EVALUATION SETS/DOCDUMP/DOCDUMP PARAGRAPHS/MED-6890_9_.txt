There was some case-control evidence for a positive association between occupational sitting and cancer; however, this was generally not supported by prospective studies. The majority of prospective studies found that occupational sitting was associated with a higher risk of DM and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence was found to support a positive relationship between occupational sitting and health risks.
