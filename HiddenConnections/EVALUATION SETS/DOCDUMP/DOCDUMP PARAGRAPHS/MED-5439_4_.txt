Other investigators, however, sustain that the beneficial effects of lipid lowering and anti-hypertensive treatment are at least, in part, due to their 'antioxidant' properties, in addition to their specific pharmacological properties [20, 21]. Oxidant stress plays a pivotal role in atherogenesis, however, the clinical promise of antioxidant vitamins has failed to translate into clinical benefit. Increasing evidence suggests that more rigorous clinical trial designs are necessary to effectively divulge antioxidant utility and that a multifaceted antioxidant approach to atherosclerosis may yield the most clinical reward.
