Chemical analysis of the component sugars indicated 6-7% possible contamination by non-bacterial polysaccharides. The bacterial pellet was 6% nitrogen, and accounted for 60% of the total faecal nitrogen. When faeces from nine healthy subjects on a metabolically controlled British-type diet were studied, bacteria comprised 54.7 +/- 1.7% of the total solids, fibre 16.7 +/- 0.8% and soluble material 24.0 +/- 1.3%.
