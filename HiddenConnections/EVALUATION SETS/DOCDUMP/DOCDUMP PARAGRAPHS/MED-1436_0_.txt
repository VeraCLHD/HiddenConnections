Abstract Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common, affecting 40% of men over 40 years of age (so-called 40 over 40) and 1 in 3 men over 70 years of age. It is predominantly a vascular condition, often preceding a cardiovascular event by 3-5 years. ED is associated as a consequence with acute coronary syndromes and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.
