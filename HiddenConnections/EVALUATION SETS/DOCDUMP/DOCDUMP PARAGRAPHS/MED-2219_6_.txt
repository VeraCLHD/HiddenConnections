The main outcomes of interest were homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, hemoglobin A1c levels, fasting blood glucose, incident diabetes, and adverse events. Data Synthesis: Thirty-five trials (43 407 patients) with variable risk of bias were included. Vitamin D had no significant effects on insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: MD −0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.30 to 0.22, I-squared statistic (I2) = 45%], insulin secretion (homeostasis model of β-cell function: MD 1.64; 95% CI −25.94 to 29.22, I2 = 40%), or hemoglobin A1c (MD −0.05%; 95% CI −0.12 to 0.03, I2 = 55%) compared with controls.
