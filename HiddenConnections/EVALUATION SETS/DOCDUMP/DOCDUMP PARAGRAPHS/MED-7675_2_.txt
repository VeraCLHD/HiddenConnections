Here, we provided molecular evidence associated with the anti-metastatic effects of peonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside, major anthocyanins extracted from black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica), by showing a marked inhibition on the invasion and motility of SKHep-1 cells. This effect was associated with a reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). Peonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside also exerted an inhibitory effect on the DNA binding activity and the nuclear translocation of AP-1.
