After further adjustment for dietary and other factors, there was a 2.3-fold excess of PD (95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) in the highest intake group (>16 oz/day) vs those who consumed no milk. The effect of milk consumption on PD was also independent of the intake of calcium. Calcium from dairy and nondairy sources had no apparent relation with the risk of PD.
