Following a Latin square design, subjects were divided into three groups, each one receiving a different kind of oil (extra virgin olive oil; EVOO, olive oil; OO or corn oil; CO, together with 150g of potatoes), with 2-week washout periods between treatments. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6h after the meal. A significant decrease in inflammatory markers, namely TXB(2) and LTB(4), after 2 and 6h after EVOO (but not OO or CO) consumption and a concomitant increase of serum antioxidant capacity were recorded.
