Abstract Background Exercise can alter health in children in both beneficial (eg reduced long‐term risk of atherosclerosis) and adverse (eg exercise‐induced asthma) ways. The mechanisms linking exercise and health are not known, but may rest, partly, on the ability of exercise to increase circulating immune cells. Little is known about the effect of brief exercise, more reflective of naturally occurring patterns of physical activity in children, on immune cell responses.
