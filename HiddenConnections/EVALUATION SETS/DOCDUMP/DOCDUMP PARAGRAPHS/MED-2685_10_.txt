Crisps were presented as 'healthy' by two leaflets; another two advised against snacking on dried fruit, conflicting with FSA guidelines that dried fruit contributes to "5 a day". Sixteen leaflets promoted cheese as 'healthy' with no limits on portion size; this could conflict with nutritional guidelines associated with percentage energy contribution of saturated fat to the diet.
