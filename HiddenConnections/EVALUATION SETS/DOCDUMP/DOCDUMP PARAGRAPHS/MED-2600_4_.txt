In a second experiment we investigated a range of fluorescent markers against a basal concentrate and barley straw diet. Ten Cheviot sheep were split into five treatment groups during a duplicate 5 Ã— 5 Latin square design. Four of the groups received a chlorophyll based marker at a rate of 2g/d: i) Mg-Chlorophyllin (MgC), ii) Fe-Chlorophyllin (FeC), iii) Zn-Chlorophyllin (ZnC) or iv) Spirulina (Chlorophyll a extract from blue green algae, Sp).
