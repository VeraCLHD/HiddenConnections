Transient triglyceridemia was induced by infusion of a triglyceride emulsion, Intralipid, which raised free fatty acid concentrations twofold and triglyceride levels fourfold. Flow-induced vasodilatation decreased from 7.1+/-3.0% to 1.6+/-2.6% (P<.0002), whereas nitroglycerin-induced vasodilatation decreased from 20.5+/-5.8% to 11.5+/-3.2% (P<.002) before and after 1 hour of infusion of Intralipid, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Transient triglyceridemia decreases vascular reactivity, presumably by both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent mechanisms.
