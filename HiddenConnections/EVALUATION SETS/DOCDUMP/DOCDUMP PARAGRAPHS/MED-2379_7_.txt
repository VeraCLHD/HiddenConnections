Outcome measurements were performed pre-meal and at specific time points up to 210min post meal. Spinach resulted in an eightfold increase in salivary nitrite and a sevenfold increase in salivary nitrate concentrations from pre-meal (P<0.001) to 120min post meal. Spinach compared with control resulted in higher large artery elasticity index (P<0.001), and lower pulse pressure (P<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (P<0.001).
