The ASA, mean diameter 134±20 μm, is connected at multiple points to repetitive circular epidural arteries with mean diameters of 150±26 μm. The capacity of the paraspinous muscular network is 25-fold the capacity of the circular epidural arterial network and ASA combined. Extensive arterial collateralization is apparent between the intraspinal and paraspinous networks, and within each network.
