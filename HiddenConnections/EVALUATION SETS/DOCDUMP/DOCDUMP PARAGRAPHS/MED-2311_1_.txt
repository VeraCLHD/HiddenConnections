PubMED (1965-May 2010) was searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids for major depressive disorder. Our primary outcome measure was standardized mean difference in a clinical measure of depression severity. In stratified meta-analysis we examined the effects of trial duration, trial methodological quality, baseline depression severity, diagnostic indication, dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in omega-3 preparations, and whether omega-3 fatty acid was given as monotherapy or augmentation.
