METHODS: We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library using the MeSH terms "Barrett's esophagus" and "Barrett esophagus," both alone and combined with the terms "risk factor," "aetiology," "diet," or "prevention." Focus was on original contributions, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. RESULTS: Established risk factors for the development of BO include gastro-esophageal reflux, obesity, male gender, Caucasian ethnicity, and increasing age.
