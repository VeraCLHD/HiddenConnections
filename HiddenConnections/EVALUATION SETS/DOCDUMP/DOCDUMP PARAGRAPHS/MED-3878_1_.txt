Within the male population, recurrent idiopathic stone formers consumed more animal protein than did normal subjects.

A high animal protein intake caused a significant increase in the urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate and uric acid, 3 of the 6 main urinary risk factors for calcium stone formation.
