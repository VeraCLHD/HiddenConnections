Abstract Summary The current intake recommendations of 200 to 600 IU vitamin D/d may be insufficient for important disease outcomes reduced by vitamin D. Introduction To assess the benefit of higher dose and higher achieved 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) versus any associated risk. Results Based on double-blind RCTs, 8 for falls (n=2426) and 12 for non-vertebral fractures (n=42,279), there was a significant dose-response relationship between higher dose and higher achieved 25(OH)D and greater fall and fracture prevention. Optimal benefits were observed at the highest dose tested to date for, 700 to 1000 IU vitamin D/d, or mean 25(OH)D between 75 to 110 nmol/l (30â€“44 ng/ml).
