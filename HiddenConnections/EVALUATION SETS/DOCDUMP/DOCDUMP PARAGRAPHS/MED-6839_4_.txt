Logistic regression was used in calculating odds ratios (ORs) for MetS. RESULTS A vegetarian dietary pattern was associated with significantly lower means for all MRFs except HDL (P for trend < 0.001 for those factors) and a lower risk of having MetS (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30â€“0.64, P < 0.001) when compared with a nonvegetarian dietary pattern. CONCLUSIONS A vegetarian dietary pattern is associated with a more favorable profile of MRFs and a lower risk of MetS.
