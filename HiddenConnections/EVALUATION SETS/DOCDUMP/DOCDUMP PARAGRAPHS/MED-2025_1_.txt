An updated correlation of the most recent data on cancer mortality and food consumption is made. Strong and consistent correlations are reported between death rates of cancers of the colon and breast and the per capita consumption of total fat and of nutrients derived from animal sources, especially beef, pork, eggs, and milk. Similar but less consistent correlations have been reported with cancers of the prostate, ovary, and endometrium.
