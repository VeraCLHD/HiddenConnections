Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 11% (p < 0.05). There was a 13% reduction, though not significant, in the cholesterol efflux from J-774 A.1 macrophages by HDL that was derived after eggs consumption in comparison to HDL that was obtained at baseline. The susceptibility of plasma [using 100 mM of 2,2' azobis 2-amidinopropane (AAPH)] as well as that of LDL (using 10 microM of copper ions) to lipid peroxidation was increased by 42% and 34%, respectively, as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay (p < 0.01).
