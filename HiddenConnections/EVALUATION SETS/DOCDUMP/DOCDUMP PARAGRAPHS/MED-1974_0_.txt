Abstract Fifty-one families of patients affected with Huntington's chorea were interviewed with respect to age at onset, symptoms at onset and course of the disease. The interview further comprised questions pertinent to line of transmission, socio-economic status, housing, previous illnesses and pregnancy and stillbirth. Since the study was set up as a fishing expedition detailed quantitative information was gathered on many life-style factors including eating, drinking and smoking habits.
