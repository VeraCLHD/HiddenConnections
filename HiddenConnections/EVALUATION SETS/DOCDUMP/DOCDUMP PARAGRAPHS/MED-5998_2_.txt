Being an integral supportive component in fungal cell wall, insect cuticle, and nematode egg shell, chitin has been considered as a selective target for pesticide action. Throughout the elaborate processes of chitin formation and deposition, only the polymerization events associated with the cell membrane compartment are so far available for chemical interference. Currently, the actinomycetes-derived nucleoside peptide fungicides such as the polyoxins and the insecticidal benzoylaryl ureas have reached commercial pesticide status.
