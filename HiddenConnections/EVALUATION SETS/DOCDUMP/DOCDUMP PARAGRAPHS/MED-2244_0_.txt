Abstract It is argued that the observed minimum needs for protein and individual amino acids by adult humans and animals may merely reflect the diet that their predecessors consumed in the course of their evolution. The ability to adapt to diets with a lower proportion of protein than was ever encountered in practice would have given no competitive advantage. This can explain the limited ability to reduce rates of amino acid catabolism.
