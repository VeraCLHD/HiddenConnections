We examined the association between dietary TAC and stroke incidence in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free women and in women with CVD history at baseline. METHODS: The study included women (31,035 CVD-free and 5680 with CVD history at baseline), aged 49 to 83 years, from the Swedish Mammography Cohort. Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire.
