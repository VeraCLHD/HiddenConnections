Abstract In western societies, casual consumption of alcohol during such outdoor activities as barbecuing and sunbathing is common. The current literature shows that alcohol drinkers have increased episodes of sunburn and a higher prevalence of skin cancer. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the combination of subcarcinogenic (minimal) ultraviolet (UV) exposure with other behavioural, environmental and xenobiotic factors has resulted in increased incidents of skin-related health problems that also result in skin-cancer formation.
