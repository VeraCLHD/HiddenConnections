METHODS: This review introduces recent articles that have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms by which food factors regulate the AhR transformation and downstream drug-metabolizing enzymes. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The role of classical ligands including dioxins as agonists of the receptor is well documented. As to the food factors, they act as antagonists because they basically suppress the AhR transformation by different mechanisms.
