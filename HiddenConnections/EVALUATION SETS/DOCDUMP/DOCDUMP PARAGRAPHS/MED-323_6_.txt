Nitrite from processed meats and other animal sources were associated with increased clear cell adenocarcinoma risk (HR=1.33, 95% CI, 1.01–1.76 and HR=1.78, 95% CI, 1.34–2.36, respectively). We found no association for nitrite intake from plant sources or nitrate intake overall. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that nitrite from animal sources may increase the risk of RCC, particularly clear cell adenocarcinomas.
