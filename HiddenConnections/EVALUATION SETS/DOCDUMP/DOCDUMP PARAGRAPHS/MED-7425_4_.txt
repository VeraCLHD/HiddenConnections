Design and Setting: This was a cross-sectional assessment of urinary iodine, perchlorate, and thiocyanate concentrations and serum thyroid function in Boston-area vegetarians and vegans. Subjects: One hundred forty-one subjects (78 vegetarians, 63 vegans) were recruited; one vegan was excluded. Results: Median urinary iodine concentration of vegans (78.5 μg/liter; range 6.8–964.7 μg/liter) was lower than vegetarians (147.0 μg/liter; range 9.3–778.6 μg/liter) (P < 0.01).
