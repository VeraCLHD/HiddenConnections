Renal vascular resistance was lower on the animal than vegetable protein diet (82 +/- 5 vs. 97 +/- 5 mmHg/min/liter; P less than 0.001). Fiber supplementation to APD did not have any effect on the renal variables measured which were indistinguishable from APD. In the acute study, GFR and RPF both rose significantly by approximately 16% (P less than 0.005) and approximately 14% (P less than 0.05), respectively, after the meat load, while RVR fell by approximately 12% (P less than 0.05).
