Abstract Consumption of eggs for a long period was shown to result in hypercholesterolemia and is generally restricted for this reason. In the present study we analyzed the effect of eggs consumption for 3 weeks on lipoprotein atherogenicity. Consumption of 2 eggs per day with the meals, for 3 weeks resulted in a minor elevation in plasma glucose and urea concentrations.
