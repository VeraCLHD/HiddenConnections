Sildenafil (Viagra(R)), tadalafil (Cialis(R)), and vardenafil (Levitra(R)) are from the same class of drugs that inhibit PDE5. Transient visual symptoms such as change in color perception and increased light sensitivity are well-known adverse effects of these drugs and occur in 3-11% of sildenafil users. Vision-threatening (serious) ocular complications, such as nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy and cilio-retinal artery occlusion have rarely been reported in PDE5 inhibitor users.
