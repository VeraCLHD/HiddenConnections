Isolated SPs were seen in only 3 brains (6%); SPs and NFTs coexisted in 13 (25.5%). The distribution patterns of NFTs and SPs differed. NFTs were seen in discrete, mostly single neurons of the structure, already noted, whereas SPs occurred in a more generalized distribution over the base and convexity of the cerebrum.
