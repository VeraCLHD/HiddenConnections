Abstract BACKGROUND: Ultrafine and fine particles are potent adjuvants in antigen-mediated immune responses, and cause inflammation in susceptible individuals. Following recent findings that microparticles accumulate in the phagocytes of intestinal lymphoid aggregates, this study is the first investigation of whether their reduction in the diet improves the symptoms of Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a double blind study, 20 patients with active corticosteroid-treated ileal or ileo-colonic Crohn's disease randomly received either a low microparticle diet (trial group; n = 10) or a control diet (n = 10) for 4 months.
