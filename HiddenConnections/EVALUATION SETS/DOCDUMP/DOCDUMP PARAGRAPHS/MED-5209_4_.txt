METHODS: Induced sputum and peripheral blood samples were collected from subjects with asthma (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 16). Dietary carotenoid intakes were estimated using the 24-hour recall method and analysed using a modified version of the Foodworks 210 Nutrient Calculation Software. Another group of healthy controls (n = 9) were supplemented with 20 mg/day lycopene for 4 weeks.
