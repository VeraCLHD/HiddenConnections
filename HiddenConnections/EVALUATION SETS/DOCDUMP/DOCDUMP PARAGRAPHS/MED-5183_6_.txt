Human LDL stimulated proliferation of ER(-) MDA-MB-231 cells, but had little effect on proliferation of ER(+) MCF-7 cells. The functional significance of these findings was demonstrated by the observation that the ACAT inhibitor CP-113,818 reduced proliferation of breast cancer cells, and specifically reduced LDL-induced proliferation of ER(-) cells. Taken together, our studies show that a greater ability to take up, store and utilize exogenous cholesterol confers a proliferative advantage to basal-like ER(-) breast cancer cells.
