In vivo patterns of change in the intracranial space, whole brain, and GM-WM ratio agreed with published postmortem data. CONCLUSION: MR images accurately depict normal patterns of age-related change in intracranial space, whole brain, GM, WM, and CSF. These quantitative MR imaging data can be used in research studies and clinical settings for the detection of abnormalities in fundamental neuroanatomic parameters.
