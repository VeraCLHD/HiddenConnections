Only 13 isolates (16%) were resistant to both the nondialysable material and metronidazole, and 30 (36%) were resistant to the nondialysable material alone. There was no cross-resistance to the nondialysable material and metronidazole. These data suggest that a combination of antibiotics and a cranberry preparation may improve H. pylori eradication.
