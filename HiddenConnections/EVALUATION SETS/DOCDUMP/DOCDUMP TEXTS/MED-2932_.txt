Abstract Despite our knowledge that atherogenesis begins in childhood and is attributable to dietary fat, pediatricians and dietitians generally frown on low-fat diets for children. It is the responsibility of clinicians to dispel the myths that make this conventional wisdom persist and encourage the adoption of a plant-based, low-fat diet. The consumption of adequate calories derived from plant-based foods will provide adequate minerals, protein, and calcium.
