Abstract Serum antioxidant vitamins A (retinol) and E (alpha-tocopherol), beta-carotene, zinc, and selenium, and cholesterol and related proteins for 170 children with newly diagnosed malignancy were measured at diagnosis and 6 months after initiation of treatment, and compared with those of 632 cancer-free controls. Incident cancer cases and controls were 1-16 years old and recruited between 1986 and 1989. At diagnosis, age- and sex-adjusted serum concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, zinc, and alpha-tocopherol were significantly inversely associated with cancer. No significant decreases in mean values were observed at 6 month, except for the alpha-tocopherol-to-cholesterol ratio in patients with bone tumors and serum zinc in bone tumors and central nervous system malignancies. An increase during the period of treatment was found for retinol and selenium in leukemia patients. beta-carotene was maintained at the initial concentrations determined prior to therapy. These findings provide further information about micronutrient requirements in children with cancer.
