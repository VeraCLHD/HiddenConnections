Abstract PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of raisins and raisin-containing cereals on plaque acidogenicity in young children. METHODS: Twenty 7- to 11-year-olds participated in this randomized controlled study. The test food groups were raisins, bran flakes, commercial raisin bran cereal (cRB) and experimental raisin bran cereal (eRB). Ten percent sucrose and sorbitol were used as positive and negative controls. The in vivo plaque pH was measured with a touch microelectrode (Beetrode) prior to (baseline) and 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after consuming a test food or rinsing with a control solution. RESULTS: All test foods reduced plaque pH over the 30-minute period, with the largest reduction noted between 10 to 15 minutes. Consumption of cRB produced the largest pH drop compared to the other food groups at 10 minutes (P < .001). Addition of raisins to bran flakes (eRB) promoted a less pronounced pH drop beyond 10 minutes when compared to bran flakes alone (P < .001). Consumption of raisins or eRB did not reduce plaque pH below 6 over the 30-minute testing period. CONCLUSION: The ranking in order of study test foods in promoting plaque acidogenicity is: (1) commercial raisin bran cereal; (2) bran flakes; (3) raisins; and (4) experimental raisin bran cereal.
