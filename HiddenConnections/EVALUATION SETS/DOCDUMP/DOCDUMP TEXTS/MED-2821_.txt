Abstract We evaluated the effect of an herbal tea preparation on infantile colic in a prospective double-blind study. The use of tea eliminated the colic in 19 (57%) of 33 infants, whereas placebo was helpful in only 9 (26%) of 35 (p < 0.01). The mean colic score was significantly improved in tea-treated infants. No significant differences were noted between groups regarding number of night wakings.
