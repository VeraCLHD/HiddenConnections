Abstract This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary pomegranate seed pulp (PSP) on meat color and lipid stability of kids. Thirty-two Mahabadi male kids were randomly assigned to one of four diets with different levels of PSP: 1 - diet without PSP (Control), 2 - diet containing 5% PSP (PSP5), 3 - diet containing 10% PSP (PSP10), and 4 - diet containing 15% PSP (PSP15). The kids were slaughtered at the end of the study and m. longissimus lumborum (LL) was sampled. The TBARS values of both raw and cooked meat were decreased (P<0.0001) by increasing levels of PSP in the diet. The meat of kids fed PSP15 showed higher a* and C* values (P<0.01) and lower H* and b* values (P<0.001), than kids fed with Control diet. The results of this experiment indicated that replacing barley and corn grains with PSP in the diet may improve the color and lipid stability of kid meat. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
