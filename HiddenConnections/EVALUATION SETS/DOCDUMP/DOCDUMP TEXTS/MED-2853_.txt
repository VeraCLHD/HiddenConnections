Abstract BACKGROUND Weight loss is recommended for overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes based on short-term studies, but long-term effects on cardiovascular disease remain unknown. We examined whether intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS We randomly assigned 5,145 overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes recruited at 16 US centers to intensive lifestyle intervention (the intervention group), which promoted weight loss through decreased calorie intake and increased physical activity, or diabetes support and education (the control group). The primary outcome was the first post-randomization occurrence of a composite cardiovascular outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalized angina) over a planned maximum follow-up of 13.5 years. RESULTS The trial was stopped early based on a futility analysis when median follow-up was 9.6 years. Weight loss was greater in the intervention group than the control group throughout (8.6% vs. 0.7% at 1 year; 6.0% vs. 3.5% at study end). Intensive lifestyle intervention also produced greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c and greater initial improvements in fitness and all cardiovascular risk factors, except LDL cholesterol. The primary outcome occurred in 403 patients in the intervention group and in 418 in the control group (1.83/100 person-years and 1.92/100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, p=0.505). CONCLUSION In our study, intensive lifestyle intervention focused on weight loss did not reduce cardiovascular events in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes.
