Abstract Obesity has a multifactorial etiology. Although obesity is widespread and associated with serious health hazards, its effective prevention and treatment have been challenging. Among the currently available treatment approaches, lifestyle modification to induce a negative energy balance holds a particularly larger appeal due to its wider reach and relative safety. However, long-term compliance with dietary modifications to reduce energy intake is not effective for the majority. The role of many individual nutrients, foods, and food groups in inducing satiety has been extensively studied. Based on this evidence, we have developed sample weight-loss meal plans that include multiple satiating foods, which may collectively augment the satiating properties of a meal. Compared to a typical American diet, these meal plans are considerably lower in energy density and probably more satiating. A diet that exploits the satiating properties of multiple foods may help increase long-term dietary compliance and consequentially enhance weight loss. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
