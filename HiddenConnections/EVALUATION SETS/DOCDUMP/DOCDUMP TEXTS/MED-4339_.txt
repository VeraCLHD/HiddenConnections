Abstract Objective Based on the hypothesis that high-meat diets may increase breast cancer risk through hormonal pathways, this analysis compared estrogens in serum and urine by meat-eating status. Design Intervention with repeated measures. Setting Two randomized soy trials (BEAN1 and BEAN2) among premenopausal healthy women. Subjects BEAN1 participants completed 7 unannounced 24-hour dietary recalls and donated 5 blood and urine samples over 2 years. BEAN2 women provided 7 recalls and 3 samples over 13 months. Serum samples were analyzed for estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) using radioimmunoassays. Nine estrogen metabolites were measured in urine by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Semi-vegetarians included women who reported <30 g/day of red meat, poultry, and fish and pescatarians who consumed <20 g/day of meat/poultry but >10 g/day of fish. All other women were classified as non-vegetarians. We applied mixed models to compute least-square means by vegetarian status adjusted for potential confounders. Results The mean age of the 272 participants was 41.9Â±4.5 years. Serum E1 (85 vs 100 pg/mL, p=0.04) and E2 (140 vs 154 pg/mL, p=0.04) levels were lower in the 37 semi-vegetarians than in the 235 non-vegetarians. The sum of the 9 urinary estrogen metabolites (183 vs 200 pmol/mg creatinine, p=0.27) and the proportions of individual estrogens and pathways did not differ by meat-eating status. Restricting the models to the samples collected during the luteal phase strengthened the associations. Conclusions Given the limitations of this study, the lower levels of serum estrogens in semi-vegetarians than non-vegetarians need confirmation in larger populations.
