Abstract Numerous scientific papers have suggested health-promoting effects of resveratrol, including claims in the prevention of diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, it was proposed that the scientific community needed to express recommendations on the human use of resveratrol. Such recommendations were formulated after the first international resveratrol conference in Denmark, Resveratrol2010. The working group stated that the evidence was "not sufficiently strong to justify recommendation for the chronic administration of resveratrol to human beings, beyond the dose which can be obtained from dietary sources." It was a disappointing conclusion relative to the positive claims about the therapeutic potential of resveratrol made by the media. However, since 2010, results from the first clinical trials on resveratrol have been made available. Because of these emerging results, it is necessary to formulate updated versions of the recommendations. Â© 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.
