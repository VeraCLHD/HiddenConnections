Abstract The effects of several types of whole fruits and vegetables on human lymphocytic DNA were investigated by using two versions of the comet assay. The total antioxidative capacity, as the FRAP value, and ascorbic acid (AA) content were also measured to explore the relationship between the effect and antioxidant content.
