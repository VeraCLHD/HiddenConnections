Abstract Behavioral studies of ultraviolet light exposure behavior have provided insight into motivations for tanning, which include not only the desire for a tanned appearance but also the physiologic response to ultraviolet light. Many frequent tanners continue to tan despite knowledge or personal experience of adverse consequences. Efforts to reduce tanning behavior need to account for the interplay between physiologic effects of tanning and psychosocial drives behind tanning behavior.
