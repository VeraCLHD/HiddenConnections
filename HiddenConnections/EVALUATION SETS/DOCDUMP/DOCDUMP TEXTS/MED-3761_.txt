Abstract Coronary vasospasm is well documented as a side effect of injectable subcutaneous forms of sumatriptan; only one such case has been reported so far with oral ingestion of sumatriptan in a patient with underlying coronary artery disease. This report describes a case of coronary vasospasm induced by oral sumatriptan even in normal coronary arteries. Physicians and patients should be aware of a small and unpredictable risk of the serious cardiac side effects of this drug.
