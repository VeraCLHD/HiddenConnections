Abstract PURPOSE: To assess the anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% copolymer and 0.243% (1,100 ppm) sodium fluoride in subjects with moderate plaque-induced gingivitis. METHODS: This was a single center, monadic study. Subjects had at least 20 teeth remaining in the functional dentition, excluding third molars. Following a baseline examination for plaque, gingival inflammation and bleeding, 75 qualified healthy adult males and females, ages 18-70 were selected to participate in the study. Dental prophylaxis was performed and subjects were provided with two tubes of toothpaste (Colgate Total) and a soft-bristle toothbrush (Colgate Wave Toothbrush). The subjects were instructed to brush twice daily using a modified Bass brushing technique. At the end of the 6- to 8-week period subjects returned for collection of clinical and subjective data. RESULTS: 75 subjects completed the study. Both clinical and subjective reductions were significant. The results showed statistically significant reductions in plaque index, gingival inflammation and bleeding on probing. The overall conclusion was that Colgate Total was a comprehensive dentifrice that produced a significant reduction in gingivitis, plaque, and bleeding.
