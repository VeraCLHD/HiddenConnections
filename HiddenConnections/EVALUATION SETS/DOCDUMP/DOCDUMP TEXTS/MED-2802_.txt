Abstract Objective The study evaluated the association between fruit and vegetable intake and upper respiratory infection (URI) incidence during pregnancy. Design In a cohort of 1034 North American women, each subject was asked retrospectively about their fruit and vegetable intake during the six months before the pregnancy and their occurrences of URI during the first half of pregnancy. Multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) were calculated with Cox proportional hazards models. Results The adjusted HRs of URI for women in the highest quartile (median = 8.54 servings/day) vs. lowest quartile (median = 1.91 servings/day) of total fruit and vegetable intake were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-1.05) for the 5-month follow-up period and 0.61 (95% CI = 0.39-0.97) for the 3-month follow-up period, respectively. A dose-related reduction of URI risk according to the quartiles of intake was found in the 3-month (p for trend = 0.03) but not the 5-month follow-up. No association was found between either fruit or vegetable intake alone in relation to the 5-month or the 3-month risk of URI. Conclusions Women who consume more fruits and vegetables have a moderate reduction in risk of URI during pregnancy, and this benefit appears to be derived from both fruits and vegetables, instead of either alone.
