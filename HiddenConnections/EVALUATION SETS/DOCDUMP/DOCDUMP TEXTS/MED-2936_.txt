Abstract Prediabetes mellitus (PDM) is defined as a state of abnormal glucose homeostasis in which deficiency or resistance to insulin is the hallmark. PDM precedes the development of overt type 2 DM. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and thus fits well with the criteria of a disease condition. Framing PDM as a disease and not a risk or a 'pre' stage for diabetes is needed to facilitate early management. AIM: This review aims therefore to increase awareness of PDM as a disease state. METHODS: To do so, we shall preview guidelines for its diagnosis. Its prevalence and hazards will be then discussed. Finally, we shall elaborate on the current treatment guidelines. RESULT: Enough evidence support the notion that PDM is a curable disease state. CONCLUSIONS: The current recommendations for the treatment of PDM should be adhered. In addition, there is a room for the use of other pharmacological agents.
