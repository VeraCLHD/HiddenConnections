Abstract Rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) is a well‐documented but uncommon clinical condition. It is usually a self‐limiting condition but can present as a life‐threatening emergency. RSH after non‐contact vigorous exercise is unknown. Two such cases secondary to yoga and laughter therapy sessions, respectively, are reported. One of them required surgical intervention, whereas the other was successfully treated conservatively.
