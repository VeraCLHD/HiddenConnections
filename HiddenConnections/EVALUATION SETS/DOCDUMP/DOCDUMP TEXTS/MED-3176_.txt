Abstract Renal and hormonal responses were studied in a group of healthy individuals fed, in random order, for three weeks, a vegetable protein diet (N = 10), an animal protein diet (N = 10), or an animal protein diet supplemented with fiber (N = 7), all containing the same amount of total protein (chronic study). In seven additional subjects the acute renal, metabolic and hormonal response to ingestion of a meat or soya load of equivalent total protein content was investigated (acute study). In the chronic study GRF, RPF and fractional clearance of albumin and IgG were significantly higher on the animal than the vegetable protein diets (GFR: 121 +/- 4 vs. 111 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.001; RPF: 634 +/- 29 vs. 559 +/- 26 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.001; theta alb: 19.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 10.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(-7), P less than 0.01; theta IgG: 11.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 x 10(-7), P less than 0.05). Renal vascular resistance was lower on the animal than vegetable protein diet (82 +/- 5 vs. 97 +/- 5 mmHg/min/liter; P less than 0.001). Fiber supplementation to APD did not have any effect on the renal variables measured which were indistinguishable from APD. In the acute study, GFR and RPF both rose significantly by approximately 16% (P less than 0.005) and approximately 14% (P less than 0.05), respectively, after the meat load, while RVR fell by approximately 12% (P less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in these parameters following the soya load.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
