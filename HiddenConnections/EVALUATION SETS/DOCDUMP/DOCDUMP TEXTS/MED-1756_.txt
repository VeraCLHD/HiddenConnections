Abstract Background Little is known about vitamin D status in breast cancer survivors. This issue is important since vitamin D influences pathways related to carcinogenesis. Objective The objective of this report is to describe and understand vitamin D status in a breast cancer survivor cohort. Design Data are from the HEAL (Health, Eating, Activity and Lifestyle) Study. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined serum concentrations of [25(OH)D] in 790 breast cancer survivors from western Washington, New Mexico and Los Angeles County. Cancer treatment data were obtained from SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) registries and medical records. Fasting blood, anthropometry and lifestyle-habits were collected post-diagnosis and treatment. We examined distributions of [25(OH)D] by race/ethnicity, season, geography and clinical characteristics. Multivariate regression tested associations between [25(OH)D] and stage of disease. Results 597 (75.6%) of women had low serum [25(OH)D] suggesting vitamin D insufficiency or frank deficiency. The overall mean (SD) was 24.8 (10.4) ng/ml, but lower for African-Americans [18.1 (8.7) ng/ml] and Hispanics [22.1 (9.2) ng/ml]. Women with localized (n=424) or regional (n=182) breast cancer had lower serum [25(OH)D] than women with in situ disease (n=184), (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Multivariate regression models controlled for age, BMI, race/ethnicity, geography, season, physical activity, diet and cancer treatments demonstrated that stage of disease independently predicted serum [25(OH)D] (p=0.02). Conclusion In these breast cancer survivors, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was high. Clinicians might consider monitoring vitamin D status in breast cancer patients, together with appropriate treatments, if necessary.
