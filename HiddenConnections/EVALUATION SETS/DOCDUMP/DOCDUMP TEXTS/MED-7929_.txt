Abstract BACKGROUND: A number of recent studies indicate that antioxidants reduce the oxidative stress associated with the development of coronary heart diseases (CHD). OBJECTIVE: (i) To investigate whether the erythrocyte catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total glutathione, reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and lipid peroxidation (LPO), and serum uric acid and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) are modified at increased CHD-risk individuals consuming walnut-enriched meat (WM), (ii) to evaluate whether these changes were influenced by basal serum cholesterol, body mass index or smoking habit. DESIGN: The study was a non blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial in which 22 volunteers (60% overweight and 40% obese) with increased CHD-risk were randomly assigned to receive WM or control meat (CM) during two different periods of 5 weeks. RESULTS: A significant interaction time*treatment (p < 0.05) was observed in all enzymes and substrates tested except HDL-C, uric acid and LPO. The treatment significantly increased CAT activity, total glutathione and GSSG (p < 0.05). Significant gender*time*treatment interaction (p = 0.043) for total glutathione was found increasing at the end of the WM period in male but not changing in female. Total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio (p < 0.05) were lower in smokers. Hypercholesterolemics presented higher uric acid (p < 0.05) but no enzyme activities or substrate concentrations were different from those of normocholesterolemics. CONCLUSIONS: The WM tested appears to be a functional food as it improved the antioxidant status of increased CHD-risk volunteers. Despite its high energy content, it also appears adequate for overweight and obese people because did not exert negative effect upon body weight.
