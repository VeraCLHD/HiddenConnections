Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the basic mechanisms of caloric intake reduction of bariatric surgery and its clinical and metabolic outcomes. To describe novel bariatric procedures, their effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and to explain the proposed mechanisms for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) resolution. RECENT FINDINGS: The effects of surgically induced weight loss on T2DM have elucidated in part the role of proximal and distal gastrointestinal bypass on insulin sensitivity. A dual mechanism for improvement in glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery has been proposed that appears to be weight loss independent. SUMMARY: Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for obesity and obesity-related comorbidities today that provide high rates of resolution of T2DM with improvements in insulin resistance and Î²-cell function. Novel bariatric procedures offer a unique opportunity to understand the pathophysiology of T2DM and to identify potential pharmacologic targets for effective T2DM treatments and a potential cure.
