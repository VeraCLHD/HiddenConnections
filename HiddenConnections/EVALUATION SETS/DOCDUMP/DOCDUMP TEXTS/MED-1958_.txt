Abstract OBJECTIVE: In this randomized clinical trial ginger efficacy for prevention of antiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting (N/V) was investigated. METHODS: From July 2011 until the end of June 2013, 102 HIV positive patients attending the HIV clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital participated in the study. In a double blinded manner, participants randomly received either 500 mg ginger or placebo two times per day, 30 min before each dose of antiretroviral regimen for 14 days. The severity of nausea was assessed based on the visual analogue scale. The number of vomiting episodes were also recorded during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 46 (90.2%) and 29 (56.4%) of the patients in placebo and ginger groups experienced some degree of nausea during the first 2 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively (p = 0.001). Frequency of mild, moderate and severe nausea were significantly lower in the ginger than placebo group (p = 0. 001). Also, 24 (47.1%) and 5 (9.8%) of the patients in the placebo and ginger groups reported at least one episode of vomiting during their time on ART, respectively (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Ginger was effective in ameliorating of antiretroviral-induced N/V.
