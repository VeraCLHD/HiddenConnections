Abstract OBJECTIVES: To study the presentations and treatment outcome of 8 consecutive patients for whom cod liver oil was injected in the subcutaneous area of their penises by a lay person for purpose of augmentation. METHODS: Various amounts of cod liver oil were injected in the subcutaneous area of the penis of 8 low socioeconomic class patients by a nonmedical person. They presented by various complications ranging from paraphimosis up to abscess formation and necrosis of penile skin. All the patients underwent emergency initial surgical intervention ranging from dorsal preputial slit to skin debridement. Definitive surgical treatment was carried out using local penile flap and V-Y plasty. RESULTS: The severity of complications was correlated to the amount of oil injected and the time interval between injections and presentation. All the 8 patients were cured after different staged surgical procedures. The postoperative course was uneventful in 6 patients, and 2 patients suffered from wound infection after the secondary treatment. All patients had acceptable cosmetic and functional outcome, and were satisfied regarding the length of the penis. None reported erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Increased public awareness is indicated to avoid this problem. Early detection and prompt treatment give acceptable anatomic and functional results. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.
