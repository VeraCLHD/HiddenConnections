Abstract 1. The degree to which disruption by mastication affects the glycaemic response to four different carbohydrate foods was investigated in healthy human volunteers; each food was eaten by six subjects. 2. Subjects ate meals of sweetcorn, white rice, diced apple or potato on two occasions; on one occasion they chewed the food thoroughly, on the other occasion they swallowed each mouthful without chewing it. 3. When the foods were chewed the postprandial blood glucose levels rose to levels which varied according to the food ingested. 4. Swallowing without chewing reduced the glycaemic response to each food, achieving a similar effect as administration of viscous polysaccharides or 'slow-release' carbohydrates.
