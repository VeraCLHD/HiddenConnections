Abstract The authors questioned the directors of 13 protected-environment installations on the psychological effects of protected environment treatment. Psychological problems reported included anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, withdrawal, regression, and hallucinations. Children seemed to adapt better than adults to protected environments. Respondents recommended the use of preentry orientation, structured recreation programs, steps to prevent time disorientation, and psychological support for both patients and staff to minimize the psychological effects of treatment in protected environments.
