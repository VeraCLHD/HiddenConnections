Abstract Background and Objectives As shown in previous studies, pentraxin 3 (PTX3) can be a useful inflammatory marker for metabolic syndrome and central obesity. Serum PTX3 levels are also an independent factor associated with visceral fat area. The aim of this study was to assess the role of PTX3 as an inflammatory maker in patients with central obesity undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) following an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Subjects and Methods From December 2007 to June 2008, 40 subjects (mean age: 61Â±11 years, M : F=34 : 6) with STEMI who underwent primary PCI were enrolled. We determined waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, body mass index (BMI), and visceral and total fat area via fat computed tomography (FAT-CT), and compared them with serum PTX3 concentrations. Results The serum PTX3 concentration was closely related to FAT-CT-estimated visceral fat area (r=0.41, p<0.01) and total fat area (r=0.38, p=0.01), respectively. The serum PTX3 concentration was not related to waist circumference (r=0.27, p=0.20), waist circumference/hip ratio (r=0.25, p=0.16), BMI (r=0.04, p=0.80) and lipid profiles, respectively. Among the parameters determining metabolic syndrome, an increasing visceral fat area had the strongest association with PTX3 concentrations. Conclusion In patients with STEMI, PTX3 is associated with central obesity and it is significantly and independently correlated with visceral fat area. FAT-CT-estimated visceral fat area is the most reliable factor associated with serum PTX3 levels in patients with STEMI and central obesity.
