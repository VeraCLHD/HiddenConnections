Abstract INTRODUCTION: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. The economic and social cost of disease is very high and there is a need for effective treatments. AREAS COVERED: The available and potential future treatments for NAFLD are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Weight loss remains the cornerstone of treatment of hepatic steatosis, but difficult to pursue. A pragmatic approach relies on generic recommendations for weight loss and physical activity in the whole population and limiting interventions to subject at risk of disease progression, but the type of preferred treatment remains a matter of debate. The large number and mechanistic diversity of drugs that have so far been investigated bear testimony to the lack of a specific, effective agent. Insulin resistance remains the pivotal alteration responsible for liver disease and its progression and insulin sensitizers are regarded as the treatment of choice. Several ongoing studies are testing the effectiveness of new approaches on histological outcomes and new metabolic pathways are under scrutiny.
