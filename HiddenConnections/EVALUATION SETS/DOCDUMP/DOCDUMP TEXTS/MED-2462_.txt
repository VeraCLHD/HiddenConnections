Abstract Postprandial lipoproteins are potentially atherogenic. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether acute consumption of red wine (RW) and dealcoholised red wine (DRW) regulates postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in 17 dyslipidaemic postmenopausal women. A mixed meal accompanied by either water, RW or DRW was consumed on three separate visits, in random order, 2 weeks apart. One fasting and 6 hourly postprandial blood samples were taken for lipid analysis. Results showed no significant quantitative changes in postprandial apolipoprotein (apo) B48 levels following the consumption of DRW or RW compared to water. However, qualitatively, DRW may reduce arterial exposure to apoB48-containing lipoproteins over the 6-h postprandial period measured. DRW consumption did not significantly change postprandial TG or insulin levels. A 35% (p = 0.02) increase in postprandial triglyceride (TG) levels and a 54% (p = 0.02) increase in insulin levels were observed following RW consumption, compared to water. In conclusion, acute DRW consumption had no effect on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in dyslipidaemic postmenopausal women. However, the consumption of full-compliment RW exacerbated the postprandial lipaemic and insulin response over the 6-h period. Collectively, our findings suggest that neither polyphenols nor red wine reduce atherosclerotic risk by acutely modulating postprandial lipaemia over a 6-h period.
