Abstract OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of an evidence-based practice project that will evaluate less restrictive dietary practices and focus on hand washing in adult patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. DATA SOURCES: Guidelines, protocols, and published articles. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of scientific basis for food restrictions, a wide variation in policies related to low-microbial diets, and inconsistent compliance with restricted diets. Furthermore, lack of consistent practice has not been related to incidence of infection. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Evaluation of an evidence-based project such as this can lead to change in practice and institutional policy.
