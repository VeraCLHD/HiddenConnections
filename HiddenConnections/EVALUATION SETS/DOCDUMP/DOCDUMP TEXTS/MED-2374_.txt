Abstract Background Higher levels of resting heart rate (HR) have been associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) but mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and rate-modulating drugs explain the HR-SCD relationship. Objective We evaluated the relationship between HR, severe LVSD, rate-affecting medications and SCD in the community, using a case-control approach. Methods From the ongoing Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study, SCD cases (n=378) aged ≥35 years and with EKG-documented resting HR, were compared to 378 age- and gender-matched control subjects with coronary artery disease (68±13 years, 69% male). Associations with SCD were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results Mean resting HR was significantly higher among SCD cases compared to controls (7.5bpm difference, p<0.0001). Heart rate was a significant determinant of SCD after adjustment for significant co-morbidities and medications [OR for 10 bpm increase = 1.26; 95% CI (1.14 – 1.38); p<0.0001]. After considering LVSD, resting HR was slightly attenuated but remained significantly associated with SCD (p=0.005). In addition to diabetes, and digoxin as well as pulmonary and renal disease, LVSD was also independently associated with SCD (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.11–2.87, p=0.02). Conclusion Contrary to expectations, the significant relationship between increased resting HR and SCD persisted even after adjustment for LVSD and rate-modulating drugs. These findings suggest a potential role for additional, novel interventions/therapies that modulate autonomic tone.
