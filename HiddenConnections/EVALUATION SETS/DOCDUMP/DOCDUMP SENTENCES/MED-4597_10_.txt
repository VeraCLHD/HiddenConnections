conclusions: these findings suggest a role of aluminium in early neurotoxic effects that can be detected at a pre-clinical stage by p300, mmse, mmse-time, cdt-time and cdt score, considering a 10 micrograms/l cut-off level of serum aluminium, in aluminium foundry workers with concomitant high blood levels of iron.
