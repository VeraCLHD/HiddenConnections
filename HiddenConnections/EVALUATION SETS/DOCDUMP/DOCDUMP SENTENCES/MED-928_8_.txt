after pooling our results with those of six published prospective studies that included 842 diabetes cases in total, we found that hcb and total pcbs both were associated with diabetes: the pooled ors were 2.00 (95% ci: 1.13, 3.53; i2 = 21.4%, pheterogeneity = 0.28) and 1.70 (95% ci: 1.28, 2.27; i2 = 16.3%, pheterogeneity = 0.30) for hcb and total pcbs, respectively.
