we also observed reduced insulin concentrations (1.4 μu/ml vs. 4.4μu/ml in unaffected relatives) and a very low homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (homa-ir) index (0.34 vs. 0.96 in unaffected relatives) in ghrd individuals, indicating increased insulin sensitivity, which could explain the absence of diabetes in these subjects.
