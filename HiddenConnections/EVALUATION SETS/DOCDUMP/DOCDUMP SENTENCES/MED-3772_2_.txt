design: we calculated the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dl at <24 mo, <11.1 g/dl at 24-59 mo, and <12.0 g/dl for women), iron deficiency anemia (anemia plus abnormal value >or=2: serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin), and high blood lead (>or=10 microg/dl) with anemia among children 12-59 mo and women 20-49 y in both surveys.
