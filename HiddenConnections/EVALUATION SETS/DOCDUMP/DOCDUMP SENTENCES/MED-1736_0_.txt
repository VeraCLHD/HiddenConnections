abstract vole pups were maintained from the time of conception in the same short-day (sd) photoperiod (10 h light/day, ld 10:14); groups differed only with respect to sd photoperiodic histories of dams before gestation, which simulated those experienced by dams breeding in autumn (sd-2, 2 wk of short days), midwinter (sd-21), or late winter (sd-26).
