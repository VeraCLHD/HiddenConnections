design: human fetal testes (14-20 wk gestation; n=12) were xenografted into castrate male nude mice that were treated for 4-21 d with vehicle, or 500 mg/kgÂ·d dbp, or monobutyl phthalate (active metabolite of dbp); all mice were treated with human chorionic gonadotropin to mimic normal human pregnancy.
