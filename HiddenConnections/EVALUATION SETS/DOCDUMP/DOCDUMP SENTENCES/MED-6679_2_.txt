it was found to have exceptional activity against superoxide in the superoxide scavenging (sod) assay, the highest of any food reported to date against the peroxyl radical as measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe (oracfl), and mild activity against both the peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical by the peroxynitrite averting capacity (norac) and hydroxyl radical averting capacity (horac) assays, respectively.
