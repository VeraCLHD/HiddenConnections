our reanalysis of published data shows that for both somatic and germ-line mutations there is an opposite, inverse dr effect, with reduction from low to very low dr, the overall dependence of induced mutations being parabolically related to dr, with a minimum in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 cgy/min (rule 1).
