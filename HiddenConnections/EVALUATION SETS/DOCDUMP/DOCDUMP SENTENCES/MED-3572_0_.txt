abstract the kinetic parameters of absorption and distribution of ingested water (300 ml labeled with d2o; osmolality <20 mosm kg−1) in the body water pool (bwp) and of its disappearance from this pool were estimated in 36 subjects from changes in plasma or urine deuterium to protium ratio (d/h) over 10 days using one- and two-compartment and a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic models (1-cm, 2-cm and n-cm which applied well to 58, 42 and 100% of the subjects, respectively).
