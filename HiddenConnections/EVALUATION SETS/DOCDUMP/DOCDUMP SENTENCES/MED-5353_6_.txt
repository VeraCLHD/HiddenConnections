we show that curcumin modulates growth of tumor cells through regulation of multiple cell signaling pathways including cell proliferation pathway (cyclin d1, c-myc), cell survival pathway (bcl-2, bcl-xl, cflip, xiap, c-iap1), caspase activation pathway (caspase-8, 3, 9), tumor suppressor pathway (p53, p21) death receptor pathway (dr4, dr5), mitochondrial pathways, and protein kinase pathway (jnk, akt, and ampk).
