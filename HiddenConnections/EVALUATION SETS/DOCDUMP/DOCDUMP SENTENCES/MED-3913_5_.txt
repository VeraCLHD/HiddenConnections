childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure (or = 2.09; 95% ci, 1.51–2.88); this association was slightly stronger for studies with high exposure-measurement-quality scores (or = 2.45; 95% ci, 1.68–3.58), higher confounder control scores (or = 2.38; 95% ci, 1.56–3.62), and farm-related exposures (or = 2.44; 95% ci, 1.53–3.89).
