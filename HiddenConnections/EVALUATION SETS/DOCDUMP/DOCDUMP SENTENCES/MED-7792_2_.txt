we evaluated renal function, pathological changes in kidney tissues and apoptotic effects using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labeling (tunel) assay in four groups of rats -- a control group (cg), fed with tap water (1); a star fruit group (sg), fed with star fruit juice naturally containing 0.2m oxalate (2); and oxalate groups (oxg), fed with 0.2m (3) or 0.4m (4) oxalate solution.
