a substantial effect on lowering concentrations of fasting plasma glucose was also noted in the 600 mg sdg group at weeks 6 and 8, especially in the subjects with baseline glucose concentrations > or = 5.83 mmol/l (lowered 25.56 and 24.96 %; p = 0.015 and p = 0.012 compared with placebo, respectively).
