here we demonstrate, based on a recently developed extraction and hplc-ms/ms method and long-term monitoring of bmaa in cyanobacterial populations of a temperate aquatic ecosystem (baltic sea, 2007â€“2008), that bmaa is biosynthesized by cyanobacterial genera dominating the massive surface blooms of this water body.
