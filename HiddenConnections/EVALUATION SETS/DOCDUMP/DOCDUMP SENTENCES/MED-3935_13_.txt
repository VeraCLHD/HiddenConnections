combining our results with those from two other studies (the meta-analyses of blood pressure cohort studies and of trials determining the blood pressure lowering effects of drugs according to dose) showed that in people aged 60-69 with a diastolic blood pressure before treatment of 90 mm hg, three drugs at half standard dose in combination reduced the risk of chd by an estimated 46% and of stroke by 62%; one drug at standard dose had about half this effect.
