associations between reduced cancer risk and increased intake of total fruits and vegetables combined and total vegetables for the entire cohort were similar (200 g/d increased intake of fruits and vegetables combined, hr = 0.97, 95% ci = 0.96 to 0.99; 100 g/d increased intake of total vegetables, hr = 0.98, 95% ci = 0.97 to 0.99); intake of fruits showed a weaker inverse association (100 g/d increased intake of total fruits, hr = 0.99, 95% ci = 0.98 to 1.00).
