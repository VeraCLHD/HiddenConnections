summary to assess sources of variability in platelet function tests in normal subjects, 64 healthy young adults were tested on 2â€“6 occasions at 2 week intervals using 4 methods: platelet aggregation (agg) in platelet-rich plasma (prp) in the bio/data pap-4 aggregometer (bd) and chrono-log lumi-aggregometer (cl); and agg in whole blood (wb) in the cl and multiplate platelet function analyzer (mp), with atp release (rel) in cl-prp and cl-wb.
