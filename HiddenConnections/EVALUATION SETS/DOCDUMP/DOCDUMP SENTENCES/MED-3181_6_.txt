a similar depression of the fractional dextran-clearance profile was observed also in group i. applying the fractional clearances of relatively permeant dextrans (radii less than or equal to 44 a) to a model of hindered solute transport through an isoporous membrane, we estimate that transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference increased by 12% in group i and by between 0 to 12% in group ii after protein ingestion.
