the mechanism through which ffa induces insulin resistance involves intramyocellular and intrahepatocellular accumulation of triglycerides and diacylglycerol, activation of several serine/threonine kinases, reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (irs)-1/2, and impairment of the irs/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway of insulin signaling.
