hazard ratios (hrs) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for estimated enterolignans, lignan-rich foods, and dietary fibre in relation to overall survival (os) and breast cancer-specific survival (bcss) were assessed using cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic/confounding factors.
