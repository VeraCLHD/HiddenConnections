materials and methods real-time qrt-pcr was used to validate the transcription level of selected mmp and timp genes in caco-2 cells after treatment with 1 ng/ml of il-1β, 2.5 mm of ip6, and both for 6, 12, and 24 h. results stimulation of cells with il-1β only resulted in an overexpression of mmp and their timp mrnas.
