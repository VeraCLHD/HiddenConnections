using random effects models, we found that compared with never/rare consumers of whole grains, those consuming 48-80 g whole grain/d (3-5 serving/d) had an ~26% lower risk of t2d [rr = 0.74 (95% ci: 0.69, 0.80)], ~21% lower risk of cvd [rr = 0.79 (95% ci: 0.74, 0.85)], and consistently less weight gain during 8-13 y (1.27 vs 1.64 kg; p = 0.001).
