in contrast to normal gastric mucosa which requires simultaneous inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2 for breakdown of mucosal resistance, in the acid-challenged rat stomach inhibition of cox-1 alone results in dose-dependent injury which is further increased by additional inhibition of cox-2 enzyme activity or prevention of acid-induced up-regulation of cox-2 expression by dexamethasone.
