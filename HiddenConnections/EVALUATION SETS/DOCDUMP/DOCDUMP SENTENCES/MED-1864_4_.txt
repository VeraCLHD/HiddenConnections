results: in the present study, healthy colostomy subjects fed stale maize porridge had significantly more production of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) (mean scfa, hrs = 182.6; mean scfa, lrs = 116.1; p < 0.05) in their colostomy effluent together with a significant drop in stool ph (mean ph, hrs = 5.91; mean ph, lrs = 6.70; p < 0.001).
