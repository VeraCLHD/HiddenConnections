results: independent of total sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity time, increased breaks in sedentary time were beneficially associated with waist circumference (standardized beta = -0.16, 95% ci -0.31 to -0.02, p = 0.026), bmi (beta = -0.19, -0.35 to -0.02, p = 0.026), triglycerides (beta = -0.18, -0.34 to -0.02, p = 0.029), and 2-h plasma glucose (beta = -0.18, -0.34 to -0.02, p = 0.025).
