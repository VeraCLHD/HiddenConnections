the proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories (rr per 1·0 mmol/l reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0·62 [99% ci 0·47–0·81], 0·69 [99% ci 0·60–0·79], 0·79 [99% ci 0·74–0·85], 0·81 [99% ci 0·77–0·86], and 0·79 [99% ci 0·74–0·84]; trend p=0·04), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events (rr 0·57, 99% ci 0·36–0·89, p=0·0012, and 0·61, 99% ci 0·50–0·74, p<0·0001) and in coronary revascularisations (rr 0·52, 99% ci 0·35–0·75, and 0·63, 99% ci 0·51–0·79; both p<0·0001).
