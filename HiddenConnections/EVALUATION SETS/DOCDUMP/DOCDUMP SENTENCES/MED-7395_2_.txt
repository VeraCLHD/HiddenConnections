multivariate analyses showed a significantly increased hazard ratio for crc overall and rectal cancer in men who reported having a bowel movement 1-2 times per day (second-highest category) as compared with once a day (crc: hazard ratio (hr) = 1.29, 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.09, 1.53 (p(trend) < 0.001); rectal cancer: hr = 1.50, 95% ci: 1.15, 1.95 (p(trend) = 0.001)).
