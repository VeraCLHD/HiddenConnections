we review the epidemiological data, as well as data from animal models and cell lines, and propose a model for pathogenesis we have termed the 'bacterial penetration cycle', whereby dietary components such as animal fat, high sugar intake and gliadin, and consumption of emulsifiers, maltodextrin as well as low-fiber diets may be able to cause a localized acquired bacterial clearance defect, leading to bacterial adhesion and penetration, and subsequently inflammation in the gut.
