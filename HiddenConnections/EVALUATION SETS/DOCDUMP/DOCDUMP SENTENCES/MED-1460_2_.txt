markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, muscle soreness and isometric strength), inflammation [interleukin-6 (il-6), c-reactive protein (crp) and uric acid], total antioxidant status (tas) and oxidative stress [thiobarbituric acid reactive species (tbars) and protein carbonyls] were examined before and following the race.
