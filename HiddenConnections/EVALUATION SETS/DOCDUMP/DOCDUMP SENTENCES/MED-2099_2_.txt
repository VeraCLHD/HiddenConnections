in a sample of 167 postmenopausal women, we found that increased serum levels of a lipid peroxidation marker, hydroperoxides, were negatively and independently associated with decreased bone mineral density (bmd) in total body (r = −0.192, p < 0.05), lumbar spine (r = −0.282, p < 0.01), and total hip (r = −0.282, p < 0.05), as well as with increased bone resorption rate (r = 0.233, p < 0.05), as assessed by the serum concentration of c-terminal telopeptide of type i collagen (ctx-1).
