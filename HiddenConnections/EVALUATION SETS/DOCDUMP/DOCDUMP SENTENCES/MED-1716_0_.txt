abstract to examine the mechanism by which lipids cause insulin resistance in humans, skeletal muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were measured every 15 min by simultaneous 13c and 31p nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in nine healthy subjects in the presence of low (0.18 +/- 0.02 mm [mean +/- sem]; control) or high (1.93 +/- 0.04 mm; lipid infusion) plasma free fatty acid levels under euglycemic (approximately 5.2 mm) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 400 pm) clamp conditions for 6 h.
