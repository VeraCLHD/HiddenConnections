significant decreases in systolic (sdv) and diastolic (ddv) ductal velocities, and rv/lv diameters ratio, as well as increase in ductal pi were observed [dsv=1.2±0.4m/s (0.7-1.6) to 0.9±0.3m/s (0.6-1.3) (p=0.018); ddv=0.21±0.09m/s (0.15-0.32) to 0.18±0.06m/s (0.11-0.25) (p=0.016); rv/lv ratio =1.3±0.2 (0.9-1.4) to 1.1±0.2 (0.8-1.3) (p=0.004); ductal pi=2.2±0.03 (2.0-2.7) to 2.4±0.4(2.2-2.9) (p=0.04)].
