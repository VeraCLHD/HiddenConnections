most ca-mrsa isolates are attributed to clonal lineages different from ha-mrsa; there are, however, clonal lineages from which both ha-mrsa and ca-mrsa have been reported (e.g. st1, st5, st8, and st22); ca-mrsa st8 (usa300), which is most frequent in the usa, has meanwhile been reported from europe.
