to characterise these agents, various chemical properties, e.g. ph, concentrations of ca, pi and f, titratable acidity to ph 7·0 and buffering capacity at the original ph value (β), as well as degree of saturation (pk - pi) with respect to hydroxyapatite (hap) and fluorapatite (fap), were determined.
