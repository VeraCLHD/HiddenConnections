il infusion was associated with a significant increase in imcl, which was comparable between aa (δ 105%; ns: 1.9 ± 0.8 vs. il: 3.9 ± 1.6 mmol/kg wet weight) and caucasian (δ 86%; ns: 2.8 ± 2.1 vs. il: 5.2 ± 2.4 mmol/kg wet weight), with similar reductions (p<0.01) in insulin sensitivity between the groups (δ −44%: ns: 9.1 ± 3.3 vs. il: 5.1 ± 1.8 mg/kg/min per µu/ml in aa) and (δ−39%: ns: 12.9 ± 6.0 vs. il: 7.9 ± 3.8 mg/kg/min per µu/ml in caucasian) adolescents.
