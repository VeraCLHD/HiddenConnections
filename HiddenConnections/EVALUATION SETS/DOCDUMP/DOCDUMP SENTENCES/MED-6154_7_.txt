in addition, lower pbf, evaluated both in flaccid (before) and dynamic (after prostaglandin-e1 stimulation) conditions, was associated with an increased risk of mace (hr = 2.67 [1.42-5.04] and 1.57 [1.01-2.47], respectively, for flaccid [<13 cm/second] and dynamic [<25 cm/second] peak systolic velocity; both p < 0.05).
