the structure-activity relationship revealed that the planar flavones and flavonols with a 7-hydroxyl group such as chrysin, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and isorhamnetin inhibited xanthine oxidase activity at low concentrations (ic50 values from 0.40 to 5.02 microm) in a mixed-type mode, while the nonplanar flavonoids, isoflavones and anthocyanidins were less inhibitory.
