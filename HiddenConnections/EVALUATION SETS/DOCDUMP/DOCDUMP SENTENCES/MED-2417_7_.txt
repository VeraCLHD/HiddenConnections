the latter effect was confirmed with an in vitro assay: cells were incubated with or without beta-cryptoxanthin before preparing an extract, which was then incubated with substrate dna containing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine; incision was more rapid with the extract prepared from carotenoid-preincubated cells.
