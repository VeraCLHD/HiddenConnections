results: evening cortisol levels in children from anthroposophic families were lower than in comparisons at 12 months of age (geometric means: anthroposophic 1.7, partly anthroposophic 1.9, non-anthroposophic 3.6 nmol/l; p = 0.024) and at 24 months of age (1.1, 1.8 and 2.9 nmol/l, respectively; p = 0.002).
