we studied leg blood flow responses to graded intrafemoral artery infusions of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator methacholine chloride (mch) or the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside during the infusion of saline and after raising systemic circulating ffa levels exogenously via a low- or high-dose infusion of intralipid plus heparin or endogenously by an infusion of somatostatin (srif) to produce insulinopenia in groups of lean healthy humans.
