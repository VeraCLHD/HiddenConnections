there was no overall association between childhood leukemia and any paternal occupational pesticide exposure (or = 1.09; 95% ci, 0.88–1.34); there were slightly elevated risks in subgroups of studies with low total-quality scores (or = 1.39; 95% ci, 0.99–1.95), ill-defined exposure time windows (or = 1.36; 95% ci, 1.00–1.85), and exposure information collected after offspring leukemia diagnosis (or = 1.34; 95% ci, 1.05–1.70).
