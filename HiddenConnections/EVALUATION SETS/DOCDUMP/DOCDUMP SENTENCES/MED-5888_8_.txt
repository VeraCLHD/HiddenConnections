in the pooled analysis, consumption of ≥10 mg isoflavones/d was associated with a nonsignificant reduced risk of all-cause (hr: 0.87; 95% ci: 0.70, 1.10) and breast cancer–specific (hr: 0.83; 95% ci: 0.64, 1.07) mortality and a statistically significant reduced risk of recurrence (hr: 0.75; 95% ci: 0.61, 0.92).
