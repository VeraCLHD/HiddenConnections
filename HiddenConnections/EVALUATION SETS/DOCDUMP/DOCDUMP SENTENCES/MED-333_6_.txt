considering the clear increments (p < .01) in urinary c-peptide excretion with diet p (20.4 +/- 10.3 nmol/d) versus diets b and m (12.6 +/- 5.1 and 13.2 +/- 3.6 nmol/d), respectively, our results suggest that a moderately strong diet-induced increase in daily insulin secretion does not alter urinary and plasma levels of dheas.
