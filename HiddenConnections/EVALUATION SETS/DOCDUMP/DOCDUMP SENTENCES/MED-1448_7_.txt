the main findings show an exercise-induced increase in dna damage and lipid peroxidation over both acute and chronic control supplementation phases (p< 0.05 v. supplementation), while acute and chronic watercress attenuated dna damage and lipid peroxidation and decreased h₂o₂ accumulation following exhaustive exercise (p< 0.05 v. control).
