protective glove use modified the associations of paraquat and permethrin with pd: neither pesticide was associated with pd among protective glove users, while both pesticides were associated with pd among non-users (paraquat or 3.9 [95% ci 1.3, 11.7], interaction p=0.15; permethrin or 4.3 [95% ci 1.2, 15.6] interaction p=0.05).
