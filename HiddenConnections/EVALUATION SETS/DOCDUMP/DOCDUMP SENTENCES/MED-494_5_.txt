after multivariable adjustment and combination of data for men and women, pancreatic cancer risk was directly related to the intakes of total fat (highest vs lowest quintile, 46.8 vs 33.2 cases per 100 000 person-years, hr = 1.23, 95% ci = 1.03 to 1.46; ptrend  = .03), saturated fat (51.5 vs 33.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, hr = 1.36, 95% ci = 1.14 to 1.62; ptrend < .001), and monounsaturated fat (46.2 vs 32.9 cases per 100 000 person-years, hr = 1.22, 95% ci = 1.02 to 1.46; ptrend = .05) but not polyunsaturated fat.
