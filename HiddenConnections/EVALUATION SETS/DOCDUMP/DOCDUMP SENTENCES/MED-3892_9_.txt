in multivariate models (after accounting for confounders, including level of adherence to nutritional guidelines), compared to those not interested in organic products, rcop participants showed a markedly lower probability of overweight (excluding obesity) (25≤body mass index<30) and obesity (body mass index ≥30): −36% and −62% in men and −42% and −48% in women, respectively (p<0.0001).
