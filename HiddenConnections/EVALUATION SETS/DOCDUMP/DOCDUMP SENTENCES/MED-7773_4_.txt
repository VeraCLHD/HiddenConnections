results: high tofu consumption was associated with worse memory (beta = -0.18, p < 0.01, 95% ci = -0.34 to -0.06), while high tempe consumption (a fermented whole soybean product) was independently related to better memory (beta = 0.12, p < 0.05, 95% ci = 0.00-0.28), particularly in participants over 68 years of age.
