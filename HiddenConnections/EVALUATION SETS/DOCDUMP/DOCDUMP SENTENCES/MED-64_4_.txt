after first removing free amino acids from tissue samples of various trophic levels (cyanobacteria, root symbioses, cycad seeds, cycad flour, flying foxes eaten by the chamorro people, and brain tissues of chamorros who died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism dementia complex), we then hydrolyzed the remaining fraction and found bmaa concentrations increased 10- to 240-fold.
