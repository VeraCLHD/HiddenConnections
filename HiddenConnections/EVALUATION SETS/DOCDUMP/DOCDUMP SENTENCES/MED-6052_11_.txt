cases were more likely than warm-room controls to have ever worked at the head-table (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 6.6; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6–26.7), removed brains or removed muscle from the backs of heads (aor, 10.3; 95% ci, 1.5–68.5), and worked within 0–10 feet of the brain removal operation (aor, 9.9; 95% ci, 1.2–80.0).
