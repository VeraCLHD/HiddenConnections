three distinct patterns of abnormal (18)f-fdg uptake were noted: pattern a (uptake localizing to supraclavicular area fat [usa-fat], i.e., without corresponding lymph node or muscle uptake on ct), pattern b (uptake localizing to muscle on ct), and pattern c (uptake localizing to lymph nodes or soft-tissue masses on ct).
