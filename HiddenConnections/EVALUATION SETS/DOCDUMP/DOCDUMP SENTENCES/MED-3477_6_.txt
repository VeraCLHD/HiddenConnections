results: the intake of the polyphenol-rich breakfast was associated with an improvement in endothelial function, as well as a greater increase in concentrations of no(x) (p < 0.001) and a lower increase in lpo (p < 0.005) and 8-epi prostaglandin-f2alpha (p < 0.001) than the ones induced by the low polyphenol fat meal.
