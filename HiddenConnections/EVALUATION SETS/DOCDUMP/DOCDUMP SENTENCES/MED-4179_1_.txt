because advanced glycation end products (ages) promote ms and neurotoxicity, we conducted studies of c57bl6 mice fed isocaloric diets containing defined ages [methyl-glyoxal derivatives (mg)] to determine whether food ages promote ad and ms. mg+-fed, but not mg−-fed, mice developed brain sirt1 deficiency, amyloid-β deposits, cognitive and motor deficits, and ms. these findings were validated in older healthy humans with high baseline circulating mg levels by a time-dependent decline in cognition and insulin sensitivity.
