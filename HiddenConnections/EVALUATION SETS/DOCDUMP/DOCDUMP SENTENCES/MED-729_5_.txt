many of the "weak" mrnas coding for proteins that promote malignant behavior or chemoresistance are regulated transcriptionally by nf-kappab and/or stat3, which are active in a high proportion of cancers; thus, regimens concurrently targeting eif4e, nf-kappab, and stat3 may suppress these proteins at both the transcriptional and translational levels, potentially achieving a very marked reduction in their expression.
