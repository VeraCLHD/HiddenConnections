by using a surrogate analyte approach, which was developed in the authors' previous studies, and extensive sample preparation procedure, which successfully eliminates many of the interfering compounds and resulting in a cleaner extract, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and selectivity of the method for the determination of steroids in complex matrices such as meat, liver and testis were improved.
