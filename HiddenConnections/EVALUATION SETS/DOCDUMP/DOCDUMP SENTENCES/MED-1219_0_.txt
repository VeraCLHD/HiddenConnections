abstract objective: determine 1) if consumption of a meal of different fruits or berries increases plasma hydrophilic (h-) or lipophilic (l-) antioxidant capacity (aoc) measured as oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac(fl)); 2) if including macronutrients in the meal alters postprandial changes in aoc; and 3) if preliminary recommendations can be developed for antioxidant intake.
