the meta-analysis for all studies with a random-effects model that was conducted after the inclusion of these recent studies showed that a 2-point increase in adherence to the mediterranean diet was associated with a significant reduction of overall mortality [relative risk (rr) = 0.92; 95% ci: 0.90, 0.94], cardiovascular incidence or mortality (rr = 0.90; 95% ci: 0.87, 0.93), cancer incidence or mortality (rr = 0.94; 95% ci: 0.92, 0.96), and neurodegenerative diseases (rr = 0.87; 95% ci: 0.81, 0.94).
