results: there was significant heterogeneity in cancer risk between groups for the following four cancer sites: stomach cancer, rrs (compared with meat eaters) of 0.29 (95% ci: 0.07–1.20) in fish eaters and 0.36 (0.16–0.78) in vegetarians, p for heterogeneity=0.007; ovarian cancer, rrs of 0.37 (0.18–0.77) in fish eaters and 0.69 (0.45–1.07) in vegetarians, p for heterogeneity=0.007; bladder cancer, rrs of 0.81 (0.36–1.81) in fish eaters and 0.47 (0.25–0.89) in vegetarians, p for heterogeneity=0.05; and cancers of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues, rrs of 0.85 (0.56–1.29) in fish eaters and 0.55 (0.39–0.78) in vegetarians, p for heterogeneity=0.002.
