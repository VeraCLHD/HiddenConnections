design: a randomized crossover trial (n = 20 men) compared the effects of 3 meals containing 54 g fat provided as whole almond seed macroparticles (wa), almond oil and defatted almond flour (ao), or a sunflower oil blend as control (co) on postprandial changes in oxidative stress (8-isoprostane f(2)alpha concentrations), vascular tone (peripheral augmentation index), and plasma triacylglycerol, glucose, and insulin concentrations.
