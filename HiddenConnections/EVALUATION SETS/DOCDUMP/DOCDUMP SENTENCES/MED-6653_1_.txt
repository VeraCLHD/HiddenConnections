the biokinetic variables were the areas under the curve (auc) of plasma frap, ascorbic acid and urate that are above the pre-dose concentration, and the amounts excreted into urine within 24 h (ae(0-24) ) of antioxidants as assayed by frap, ascorbic acid, uric acid, malondialdehyde (biomarker for oxidative stress), and hippuric acid (metabolite and potential biomarker for total polyphenol intake).
