in addition to the four target fluorochemicals measured, qualitative analysis of selected blood samples showed the presence of other perfluorochemicals such as perfluorodecanesulfonate (pfds), perfluoroheptanoic acid (pfhpa), perfluorononanoic acid (pfna), perfluorodecanoic acid (pfda), perfluorododecanoic acid (pfdoa), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (pfunda) in serum samples, at concentrations approximately 5- to 10-fold lower than the concentration of pfos.
