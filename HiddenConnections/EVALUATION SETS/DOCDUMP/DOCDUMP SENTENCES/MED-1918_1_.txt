the present article reviews the history of our evolving understanding of physiological ph, the physiological support for the concept of 'acidosis', the causes of acidosis, how it is recognised, its short-term effects as well as the long-term clinical relevance of preventative measures, and the research support for normalisation of ph. further, we suggest differentiation of the terms 'acidosis' and 'acidaemia' as a way to resolve the conflation of these topics which has led to confusion and controversy.
