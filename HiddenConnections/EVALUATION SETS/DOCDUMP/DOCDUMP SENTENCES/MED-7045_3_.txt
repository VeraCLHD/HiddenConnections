high-level monounsaturated fatty acid oils gave a linear relationship between 100 times the reciprocal of the induction period against the total unsaturated fatty acid content obtained as %c18:2 + 0.08 x c18:1 + 2.08 x %c18:3, while the polyunsaturated fatty acid oils gave an exponential relationship.
