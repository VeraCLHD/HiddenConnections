sitting for 5 h (1st vs. 5th h) resulted in an increase in calf venous pooling (17%) and a decrease in calf bf (13%), a reduction in gravitational pooling in the thigh (corresponding to increased pooling in the calf), increases in diastolic and mean arterial pressures (6 and 7.3 mmhg, respectively), and minor changes in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output.
