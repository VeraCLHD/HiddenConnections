results: significant reductions in ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by adp and collagen were observed 3 h after supplementation with doses of tomato extract equivalent to 6 (6te) and 2 (2te) tomatoes [3 micromol adp/l: 6te (high dose), -21.3%; 2te (low dose), -12.7%; p < 0.001; 7.5 micromol adp/l: 6te, -7.8%, 2te, -7.6%; p < 0.001; 3 mg collagen/l: 6te, -17.5%; 2te, -14.6%; p = 0.007].
