research, however, reveals that: 1) very small amounts of al are needed to produce neurotoxicity and this criterion is satisfied through dietary al intake, 2) al sequesters different transport mechanisms to actively traverse brain barriers, 3) incremental acquisition of small amounts of al over a lifetime favors its selective accumulation in brain tissues, and 4) since 1911, experimental evidence has repeatedly demonstrated that chronic al intoxication reproduces neuropathological hallmarks of ad.
