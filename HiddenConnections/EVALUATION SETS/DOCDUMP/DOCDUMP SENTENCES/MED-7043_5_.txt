results: with a mean daily consumption of 67 g of nuts, the following estimated mean reductions were achieved: total cholesterol concentration (10.9 mg/dl [5.1% change]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (ldl-c) (10.2 mg/dl [7.4% change]), ratio of ldl-c to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (hdl-c) (0.22 [8.3% change]), and ratio of total cholesterol concentration to hdl-c (0.24 [5.6% change]) (p < .001 for all) (to convert all cholesterol concentrations to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259).
