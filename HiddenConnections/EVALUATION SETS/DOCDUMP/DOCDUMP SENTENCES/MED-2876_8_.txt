analysis using extended cox models for the neap groups adjusted for baseline characteristics (referring to group 1 showing the lowest neap) showed that high neap was associated with a high risk of ckd progression; group 2, adjusted hazard ratio (hr) 3.930 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.914, 8.072); group 3, adjusted hr 4.740 (95% ci 2.196, 10.288); group 4, adjusted hr 4.303 (95% ci 2.103, 8.805).
