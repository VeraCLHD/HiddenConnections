published cases of vitamin d toxicity with hypercalcemia, for which the 25(oh)d concentration and vitamin d dose are known, all involve intake of > or = 1000 microg (40000 iu)/d. because vitamin d is potentially toxic, intake of >25 microg (1000 iu)/d has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted, no observed adverse effect limit of 50 microg (2000 iu)/d is too low by at least 5-fold.
