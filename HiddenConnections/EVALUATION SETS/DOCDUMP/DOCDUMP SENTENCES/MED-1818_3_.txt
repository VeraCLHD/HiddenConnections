results: participants with rbc dha levels in the lowest quartile (q1) when compared to others (q2–4) had lower total brain and greater white matter hyperintensity volumes (for model a: β ± se = −0.49 ± 0.19; p = 0.009, and 0.12 ± 0.06; p = 0.049, respectively) with persistence of the association with total brain volume in multivariable analyses.
