compared with the lowest quintile of acrylamide intake (mean intake, 8.9 mug/day), multivariable-adjusted hazard rate ratios (hr) for endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer in the highest quintile (mean intake, 40.2 mug/day) were 1.29 [95% confidence interval (95% ci), 0.81-2.07; p(trend)=0.18], 1.78 (95% ci, 1.10-2.88; p(trend)=0.02), and 0.93 (95% ci, 0.73-1.19; p(trend)=0.79), respectively.
