with ingested amounts found in foods, vitamin c plasma concentrations do not exceed 100 μmol/l. even with supplementation approaching maximally tolerated doses, ascorbate plasma concentrations are always <250 μmol/l and frequently <150 μmol/l. by contrast, when ascorbate is i.v. injected, tight control is bypassed until excess ascorbate is eliminated by glomerular filtration and renal excretion.
