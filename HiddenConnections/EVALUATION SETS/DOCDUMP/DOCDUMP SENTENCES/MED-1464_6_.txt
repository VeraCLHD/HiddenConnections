results: consumption of 750 ml but not of 250 or 500 ml orange juice daily increased hdl-cholesterol concentrations by 21% (p: < 0.001), triacylglycerol concentrations by 30% (from 1.56 +/- 0.72 to 2.03 +/- 0.91 mmol/l; p: < 0.02), and folate concentrations by 18% (p: < 0.01); decreased the ldl-hdl cholesterol ratio by 16% (p: < 0.005); and did not affect homocyst(e)ine concentrations.
