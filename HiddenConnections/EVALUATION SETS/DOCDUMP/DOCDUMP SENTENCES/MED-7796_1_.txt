the reversed-phase ods cartridge/silica gel combination were effective and the optimal wash and elution conditions were: h(2)o (wash), 20% methanol in water (wash), and 90% methanol in water (elution) for the reversed-phase ods cartridge, followed by 80% methanol in water elution in the silica gel cartridge.
