the animal low-carbohydrate score was associated with a higher all-cause mortality (pooled hr comparing extreme deciles=1.23, 95% ci=1.11-1.37, p-trend=0.05), cardiovascular mortality (corresponding hr=1.14, 95% ci=1.01-1.29, p-trend=0.029), and cancer mortality (corresponding hr=1.28, 95% ci 1.02-1.60, p for trend = 0.09).
