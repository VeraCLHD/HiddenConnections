multivariable-adjusted relative risks (rr), controlled for known stroke risk factors and fish consumption, were 1.67 [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.29-2.17] for total stroke, 1.61 (95% ci, 1.19-2.17) for ischaemic stroke and 2.80 (95% ci, 1.42-5.55) for haemorrhagic stroke for women in the highest quartile of dietary pcb exposure (median 288 ng day(-1) ) compared with women in the lowest quartile (median 101 ng day(-1) ).
