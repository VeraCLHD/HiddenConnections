in order to provide simple guidance on nitrate intake from different vegetables, we have developed the nitrate ‘veg‐table’ with ‘nitrate units’ [each unit being 1 mmol of nitrate (62 mg)] to achieve a nitrate intake that is likely to be sufficient to derive benefit, but also to minimize the risk of potential side effects from excessive ingestion, given the current available evidence.
