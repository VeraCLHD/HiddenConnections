methods: using data from 274 us counties, from 2002 to 2008, we regressed county influenza-related hospitalization rates on county prevalence of obesity (bmi â‰¥ 30), low fruit/vegetable consumption (<5 servings/day), and physical inactivity (<30 minutes/month recreational exercise), while adjusting for community-level confounders such as insurance coverage and the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 population.
