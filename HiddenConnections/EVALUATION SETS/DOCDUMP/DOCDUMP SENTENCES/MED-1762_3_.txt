results: over 2–7 years of duration, vitamin d supplementations had little effect on total cancer incidence (400–1100 iu per day, summary relative risk (rr)=1.00, 95% confidence interval (ci)=0.94–1.06, i2=0% four rcts with combined 4333 cases), but significantly reduced total cancer mortality (400–833 iu per day, summary rr=0.88, 95% ci=0.78–0.98, i2=0%, three rcts with combined 1190 deaths).
