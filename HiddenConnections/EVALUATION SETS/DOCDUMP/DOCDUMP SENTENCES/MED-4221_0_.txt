abstract the initial effects of free fatty acids (ffas) on glucose transport/phosphorylation were studied in seven healthy men in the presence of elevated (1.44 +/- 0.16 mmol/l), basal (0.35 +/- 0.06 mmol/l), and low (<0.01 mmol/l; control) plasma ffa concentrations (p < 0.05 between all groups) during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps.
