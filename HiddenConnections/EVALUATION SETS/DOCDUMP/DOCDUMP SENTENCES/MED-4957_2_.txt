for the in vivo studies, female 7-week-old nude mice were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: bikunin-treated groups (n = 9 in each group) received 3, 10, or 30 microg/g body weight per day bikunin for 7 days via gastrointestinal gavage, and a control group (n = 9) received the vehicle solution (phosphate-buffered saline) via gastrointestinal gavage.
