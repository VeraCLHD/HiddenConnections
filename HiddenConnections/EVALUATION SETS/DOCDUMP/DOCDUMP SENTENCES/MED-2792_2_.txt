the phylogenetically related 7-transmembrane (7tm) receptors free fatty acid receptor 2 (ffa2) and ffa3 are activated by these scfas, and several lines of evidence indicate that ffa2 and ffa3 mediate beneficial effects associated with a fiber-rich diet, and that they may be of interest as targets for treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.
