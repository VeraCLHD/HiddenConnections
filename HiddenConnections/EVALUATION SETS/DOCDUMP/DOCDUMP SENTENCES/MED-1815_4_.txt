results: whole brain and intracranial space grew by 25%-27% between early childhood (mean age, 26 months; age range, 19-33 months) and adolescence (mean age, 14 years; age range, 12-15 years); thereafter, whole-brain volume decreased such that volunteers (age range, 71-80 years) had volumes similar to those of young children.
