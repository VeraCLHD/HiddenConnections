we identify areas of interest for future research, including time-trends in the incidence and prevalence of als; the meaning of lifetime risk; the phenotypic description of als; the definition of familial versus sporadic als, syndromic aspects of als; specific risk factors such as military service, life style factors such as smoking, the use of statins, and the presence of Î²-n-methylamino-l-alanine (bmaa), an excitotoxic amino acid derivative possibly produced by cyanobacteria found in almost every terrestrial and aquatic habitat; the emergence and disappearance of an endemic als in areas of the pacific; and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of als.
