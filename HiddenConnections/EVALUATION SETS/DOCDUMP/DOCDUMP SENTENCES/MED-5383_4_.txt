test methods included direct binding to the estrogen receptor (er), proliferation of mcf-7 cells, transient reporter gene expression in mcf-7 cells, reporter gene expression in yeast strains stably transfected with the human er and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene, and vitellogenin production in juvenile rainbow trout.
