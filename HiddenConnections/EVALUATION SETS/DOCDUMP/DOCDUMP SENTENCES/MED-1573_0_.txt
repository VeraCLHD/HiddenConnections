abstract on the basis of copious preclinical data supporting the preventive efficacy of small fruits such as berries and grapes, chen and colleagues conducted a randomized (noncomparative) phase ii trial evaluating two doses of strawberry powder (60 g/d or 30 g/d for six months) to prevent esophageal cancer in china (reported in this issue of the journal, beginning on page 41); 60 g/d reduced the histologic grade of dysplastic lesions and reduced localized biomarkers, whereas 30 g/d was not effective.
