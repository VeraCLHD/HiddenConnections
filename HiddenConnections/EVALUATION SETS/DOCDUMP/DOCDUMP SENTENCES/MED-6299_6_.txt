we screened narms isolates for the presence of blacmy, determined whether the gene was plasmid-encoded, examined pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns to assess the genetic diversities of the isolates, and categorized the blacmy plasmids by plasmid incompatibility groups and plasmid multi-locus sequence typing.
