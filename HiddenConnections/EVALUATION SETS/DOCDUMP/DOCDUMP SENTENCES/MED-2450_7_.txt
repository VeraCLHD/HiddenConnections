acetic acid treatment (5 mmol/l and 15 d) significantly decreased the activities of disaccharidases (sucrase, maltase, trehalase and lactase) and angiotensin-i-converting enzyme, whereas the activities of other hydrolases (alkaline phosphatase, aminopeptidase-n, dipeptidylpeptidase-iv and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) were not affected.
