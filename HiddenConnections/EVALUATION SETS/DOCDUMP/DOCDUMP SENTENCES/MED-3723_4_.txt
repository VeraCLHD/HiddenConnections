multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that the daily intake of 80 g of fruits per 4184 kj (1000 kcal) (or 0·781; 95 % ci 0·617, 0·987; p = 0·039) or 50 g of vegetables per 4184 kj (1000 kcal) (or 0·781; 95 % ci 0·618, 0·988; p = 0·040) reduced the chance of the presence of high mean bp (mbp ≥ 92 mmhg) by 22 % each, adjusted for possible confounders.
