by utilizing the doubling time assay, soft agar assay, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay, we showed that 10 repeated estradiol-17beta or zeranol treatment cycles to mcf-10a cells decrease the doubling time of the cells by 30 to 40% and stimulate colony formation in soft agar and induce estrogen receptor beta (er-beta) mrna expression, all of which are not dose related in our tested dose range.
