the ingestion of nitrite-preserved meats (85-170 g per meal), including canned, rolled or yunnan ham, cured pork, luncheon meat, and various chinese and european-style sausages, led to urinary npro excretion levels ranging from 2.5 to 78.5 micrograms/24 h, whereas the consumption of non-preserved meat and fish products, including chicken, herring, salmon, shrimp, ground beef (hamburger), pork chops and beef liver, led to relatively low npro excretion levels, ranging from 0.0 to 0.8 micrograms/24 h.
