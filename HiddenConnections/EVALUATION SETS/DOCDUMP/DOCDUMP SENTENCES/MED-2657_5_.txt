results: compared to control, consumption of gt with milk, caseinate, or soy protein significantly reduced the bioavailability (mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve) of total catechins (means ± sem; gt + m, 87 ± 5%; gt + cs, 79 ± 5%; gt + s, 88 ± 4%), epigallocatechin gallate (gt + m, 68 ± 4%; gt + cs, 63 ± 5%; gt + s, 76 ± 5%), and epicatechin gallate (gt + m, 68 ± 5%; gt + cs, 66 ± 6%; gt + s, 77 ± 6%), while the bioavailability of non-galloylated catechins such as epigallocatechin (gt + m, 134 ± 9%; gt + cs, 118 ± 9 %; gt + s, 123 ± 8%) and epicatechin (gt + m, 125 ± 10%; gt + cs, 114 ± 11%; gt + s, 110 ± 8%) significantly increased.
