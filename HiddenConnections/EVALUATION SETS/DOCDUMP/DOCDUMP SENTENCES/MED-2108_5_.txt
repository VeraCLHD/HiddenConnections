nevertheless, predicted dietary intake rates for all four investigated phthalates were far below the corresponding tolerable daily intake (tdi) values (i.e. p99 intake values were 6.4% of the tdi at most), which is reassuring because adults are also exposed to phthalates via other contamination pathways (e.g. dust ingestion and inhalation).
