there was significant heterogeneity between dietary groups in risks of the following cancers: stomach cancer [rrs (95% cis) compared with meat eaters: 0.62 (0.27, 1.43) in fish eaters and 0.37 (0.19, 0.69) in vegetarians; p-heterogeneity = 0.006], colorectal cancer [rrs (95% cis): 0.66 (0.48, 0.92) in fish eaters and 1.03 (0.84, 1.26) in vegetarians; p-heterogeneity = 0.033], cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue [rrs (95% cis): 0.96 (0.70, 1.32) in fish eaters and 0.64 (0.49, 0.84) in vegetarians; p-heterogeneity = 0.005], multiple myeloma [rrs (95% cis): 0.77 (0.34, 1.76) in fish eaters and 0.23 (0.09, 0.59) in vegetarians; p-heterogeneity = 0.010], and all sites combined [rrs (95% cis): 0.88 (0.80, 0.97) in fish eaters and 0.88 (0.82, 0.95) in vegetarians; p-heterogeneity = 0.0007].
