particularly, the mixed meal postprandial adiponectin showed stronger correlations with most traits of the metabolic syndrome than fasting adiponectin: postprandial adiponectin with hdl (r 0.30) v. fasting adiponectin with hdl (r 0.23); with postprandial insulin (area under the curve): r - 0.20 v. r - 0.16; with fasting insulin: r 0.10 v. r 0.14; with bmi: r - 0.23 v. r - 0.20; with waist: r - 0.18 v. - 0.16; with systolic blood pressure: r - 0.14 v. r - 0.12; with diastolic blood pressure: r - 0.18 v. r - 0.15.
