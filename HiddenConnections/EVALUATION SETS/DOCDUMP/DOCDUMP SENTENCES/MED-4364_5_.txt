endogenous sulfate availability (as reflected by renal sulfate output per 24 hours) approximately doubled with diets p and m. however, plasma levels (6.3 +/- 1.5, 6.8 +/- 1.8, and 6.9 +/- 2.1 micromol/l for b, p, and m, respectively) and urinary excretion (8.8 +/- 9.8, 9.4 +/- 11.2, 8.0 +/- 8.3 micromol/d) of dheas remained unaffected.
