the present study showed that such supplements (strawberry, spinach, or blueberry at 14.8, 9.1, or 18.6 gm of dried aqueous extract per kilogram of diet, respectively) fed for 8 weeks to 19-month-old fischer 344 rats were also effective in reversing age-related deficits in several neuronal and behavioral parameters including: oxotremorine enhancement of k(+)-evoked release of dopamine from striatal slices, carbachol-stimulated gtpase activity, striatal ca(45) buffering in striatal synaptosomes, motor behavioral performance on the rod walking and accelerod tasks, and morris water maze performance.
