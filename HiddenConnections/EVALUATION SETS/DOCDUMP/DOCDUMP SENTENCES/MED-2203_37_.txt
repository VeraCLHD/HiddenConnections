we did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin d on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin d level below 20 ng/ml at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin d levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/ml at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 iu per day compared with trials using doses above 800 iu per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men.
