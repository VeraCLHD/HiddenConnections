the noncovalent binding of the inhibitory flavonoids to alpha-synuclein and the covalent modification by the flavonoid quinone led to the restriction of the conformational changes in this natively unfolded protein and to the stabilization of soluble flavonoid-modified species of alpha-synuclein (monomers and oligomers).
