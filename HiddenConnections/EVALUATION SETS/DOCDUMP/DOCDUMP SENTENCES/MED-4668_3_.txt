by application of computational methods for distant homology detection, comparative modeling, and molecular docking, guided by available experimental data, we have generated a three-dimensional structural model of a partial telomerase elongation complex composed of three essential protein domains bound to a single-stranded telomeric dna sequence in the form of a heteroduplex with the template region of the human rna subunit, ter.
