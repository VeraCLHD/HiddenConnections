results: dietary manipulation provided no added effect to corticosteroid treatment on any of the outcome measures during the dietary trial (16 weeks) or follow-up (to 1 year); e.g., for logistic regression of crohn's disease activity index based rates of remission (p=0.1) and clinical response (p=0.8), in normal versus low microparticle groups.
