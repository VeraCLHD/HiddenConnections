a nonsignificant increase in the risk of endometrial cancer was associated with increased consumption of red meat [hazard ratio (hr)=1.62, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=0.86-3.08, for high vs. low intake; p trend=0.13)], processed meat (hr=1.45, 95% ci=0.80-2.61, for high vs. low intake; p trend=0.058), and all meat combined (hr=1.50, 95% ci=0.78-2.89, for high vs. low intake; p trend=0.14).
