abstract in this study, six common tests for measuring antioxidant activity were evaluated by comparing four antioxidants and applying them to beverages (tea and juices): trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (teac i-iii assay), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter assay (trap assay), 2,2-diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl assay (dpph assay), n,n-dimethyl-p-phenylendiamine assay (dmpd assay), photochemiluminescence assay (pcl assay) and ferric reducing ability of plasma assay (frap assay).
