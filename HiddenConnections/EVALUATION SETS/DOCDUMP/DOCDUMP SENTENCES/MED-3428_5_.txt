results: posm was higher in de than control (con), indicating suboptimal hydration when using the 316 mosm/l tosm cutoff for de (mean posm + 11 mosm/kg versus con, p = 0.004, cohen's effect size [d]) = 0.83) and the more conservative tosm classification for de where tosm >324 and con <308 mosm/l (mean posm + 12 mosm/kg versus con, p = 0.006, d = 0.94).
