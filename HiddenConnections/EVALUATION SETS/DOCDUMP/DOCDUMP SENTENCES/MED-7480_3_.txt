however, unlike nonpickled vegetables, pickled vegetable intake and its proportion relative to total vegetables were positively associated with the risk of breast cancer, and this association was more profound and consistent when pickled vegetable intake was considered as a proportion relative to total vegetables (odds ratio [or] = 6.24, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 3.55-10.97; p for trend <0.001 for highest vs. lowest quartiles of intake) than as the absolute consumed amount (or = 2.47, 95% ci = 1.45-4.21; p for trend = 0.015 for highest vs. lowest quartiles of intake).
