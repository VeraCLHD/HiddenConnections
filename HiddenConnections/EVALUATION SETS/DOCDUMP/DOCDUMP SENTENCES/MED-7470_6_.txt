under the oxidative action of aaph, all methanolic extracts significantly protected the erythrocyte membrane from hemolysis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, although leaf extract inhibitory efficiency was much stronger (ic(50) of 0.060 mg/ml) than that observed for green husks and seeds (ic(50) of 0.127 and 0.121 mg/ml, respectively).
