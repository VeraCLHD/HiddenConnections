when the risks were adjusted for each other and other risk factors, the only persistent significant associations were for children's intake of hot dogs (odds ratio [or] = 9.5, 95 percent confidence interval [ci] = 1.6-57.6 for 12 or more hot dogs per month, trend p = 0.01), and fathers' intake of hot dogs (or = 11.0, ci = 1.2-98.7 for highest intake category, trend p = 0.01).
