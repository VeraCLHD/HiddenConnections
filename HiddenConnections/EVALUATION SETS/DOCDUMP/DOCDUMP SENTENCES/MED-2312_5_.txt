mechanistically, [6]-gingerol down-regulated phorbol myristate acetate (pma) induced phosphorylation of erk1/2 and jnk map kinases and activation of ap-1 transcription factor, but had only little effects on phosphorylation of p38 map kinase and activation of nf-kappa b. additionally, it complemented the inhibitors of either erk1/2 or jnk map kinase in bringing down the pma-induced cell proliferation in sw-480 cells.
