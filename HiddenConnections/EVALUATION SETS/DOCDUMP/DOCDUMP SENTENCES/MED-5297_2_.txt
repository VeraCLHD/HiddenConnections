the authors found a positive association with total meat intake (risk ratio (rr) for > or =1 time/week vs. no meat intake = 1.85, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.19-2.87; p for trend = 0.01) and, among subjects who favored specific types of meat, positive associations with red meat intake (rr for > or =1 time/week vs. no red meat intake = 1.90, 95% ci 1.16-3.11; p for trend = 0.02) and white meat intake (rr for > or =1 time/week vs. no white meat intake = 3.29, 95% ci 1.60-6.75; p for trend = 0.006).
