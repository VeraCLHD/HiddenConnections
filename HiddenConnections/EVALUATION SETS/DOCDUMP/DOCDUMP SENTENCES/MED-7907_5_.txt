a doubling in holotc concentrations (from 50 to 100 pmol/l) was associated with a 30% slower rate of cognitive decline (-0.137 to -0.083), whereas a doubling in thcy (from 10 to 20 micromol/l) or mma (from 0.25 to 0.50 micromol/l) was associated with >50% more rapid cognitive decline (-0.090 to -0.169) and (-0.104 to -0.169), respectively.
