recent discoveries that found that bmaa is produced by symbiotic cyanobacteria within specialized roots of the cycads; that the concentration of protein-bound bmaa is up to a hundred-fold greater than free bmaa in the seeds and flour; that various animals forage on the seeds (flying foxes, pigs, deer), leading to biomagnification up the food chain in guam; and that protein-bound bmaa occurs in the brains of guamanians dying of als/pdc (average concentration 627 microg/g, 5 mm) but not in control brains have rekindled interest in bmaa as a possible trigger for guamanian als/pdc.
