abstract the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), total antioxidant capacities (tac), as measured by three different analytical assays [trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (trap), ferric reducing antioxidant power (frap)] and physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and broccoli).
