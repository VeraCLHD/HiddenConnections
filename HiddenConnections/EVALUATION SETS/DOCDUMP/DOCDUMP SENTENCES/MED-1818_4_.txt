participants with lower dha and ω-3 index (rbc dha+epa) levels (q1 vs q2–4) also had lower scores on tests of visual memory (β ± se = −0.47 ± 0.18; p = 0.008), executive function (β ± se = −0.07 ± 0.03; p = 0.004), and abstract thinking (β ± se = −0.52 ± 0.18; p = 0.004) in model a, the results remaining significant in all models.
