the tumors of diet-treated patients were compared with those of historic cases (matched by age, race, prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, and biopsy gleason sum) with respect to apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [tdt]-mediated dutp-biotin nick end-labeling [tunel]) and proliferation (mib-1).
