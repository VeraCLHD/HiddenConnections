the cardiovascular risk biomarkers such as endothelial function, using flow-mediated dilation (fmd) technique, low-density lipoprotein (ldl) oxidation products and inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (svcam-1) as well as lipids and lipoprotein levels were monitored.
