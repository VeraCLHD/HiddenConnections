in a model including fbg and 2h-bg simultaneously, hazards ratios (95% confidence intervals) in subjects with diabetes on 2h-bg were 1.73 (1.45-2.06) for all causes, 1.40 (1.02-1.92) for cardiovascular disease, 1.56 (1.03-2.36) for coronary heart disease, and 1.29 (0.66-2.54) for stroke mortality, compared with the normal 2h-bg group.
