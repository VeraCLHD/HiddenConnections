aebr reduced the viability of breast cancer cell lines mcf-7 (er(+), her2/neu(-)), mda-mb-231 (er(-), her2/neu(-)), and mda-mb-453 (er(-), her2/neu(+)) and induced apoptosis in mda-mb-453 cells via the intrinsic pathway in vitro by activating caspase cascade, cleaving poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp), depolarizing mitochondrial membrane potential, and releasing cytochrome c. oral administration of aebr (100 mg/kg/day) to balb/c nude mice bearing mda-mb-453 cell xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis by suppressing the expression of angiogenesis factors mmp-9, mmp-2, and upa in tumor tissue.
