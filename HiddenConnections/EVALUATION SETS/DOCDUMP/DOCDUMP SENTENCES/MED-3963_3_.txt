we compared single-nucleotide variants (snvs) between the isolates, using c. difficile evolution rates estimated on the basis of the first and last samples obtained from each of 145 patients, with 0 to 2 snvs expected between transmitted isolates obtained less than 124 days apart, on the basis of a 95% prediction interval.
