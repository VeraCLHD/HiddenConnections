in hyperglycemic and oxidative conditions, sulforaphane has the potential to activate the nf-e2-related factor-2 (nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response-signaling pathway, induces phase 2 enzymes, attenuates oxidative stress, and inactivates nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-Îºb), a key modulator of inflammatory pathways.
