peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (pbmcs), as well as purified monocytes and cd4 and cd8 t cells, were isolated from healthy volunteers and cultured in the presence of cocoa flavanol fractions that differ from another by the degree of flavanol polymerization: short-chain flavanol fraction (scff), monomers to pentamers; and long-chain flavanol fraction (lcff), hexamers to decamers.
