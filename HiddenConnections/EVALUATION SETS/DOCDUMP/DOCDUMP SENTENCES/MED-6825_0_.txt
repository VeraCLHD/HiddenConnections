abstract objective: to determine whether (1) rapid consumption of 1 l of apple juice increases blood antioxidant capacity, measured as ferric-reducing ability of plasma (frap) and serum 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical-scavenging activity, and (2) apple polyphenols or fructose-induced elevation of plasma uric acid contributes to post-juice increase of blood antioxidant activity.
