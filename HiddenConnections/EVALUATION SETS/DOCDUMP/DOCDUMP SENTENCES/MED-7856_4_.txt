we have used the ht29, ht115 and caco-2 cell lines as in vitro models to examine the effect of apple phenolics (0.01-0.1% apple extract) on key stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, namely; dna damage (comet assay), colonic barrier function (ter assay), cell cycle progression (dna content assay) and invasion (matrigel assay).
