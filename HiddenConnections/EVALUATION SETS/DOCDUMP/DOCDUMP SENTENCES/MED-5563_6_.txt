curcumin has the ability to inhibit carcinogenicity through the modulation of the cell cycle by binding directly and indirectly to molecular targets including transcription factors (nf-kb, stat3, Î²-catenin, and ap-1), growth factors (egf, pdgf, and vegf), enzymes (cox-2, inos, and mmps), kinases (cyclin d1, cdks, akt, pkc, and ampk), inflammatory cytokines (tnf, mcp, il-1, and il-6), upregulation of proapoptotic (bax, bad, and bak) and downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins (bcl(2) and bcl-xl).
