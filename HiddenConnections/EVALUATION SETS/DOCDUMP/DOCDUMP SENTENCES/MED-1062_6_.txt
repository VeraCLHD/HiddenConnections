in addition, changes in metabolism of endogenous hormones, cross-talk between genomic and nongenomic pathways, cross talk with estrogen receptors after binding on other receptors, interference with feedback regulation and neuroendocrine cells, changes in dna methylation or histone modifications, and genomic instability by interference with the spindle figure can play a role.
