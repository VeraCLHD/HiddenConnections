we examined the impact of these changes on cellular replicative lifespan and found that caregivers had significantly shorter telomere lengths in pbmc than controls (6.2 and 6.4 kb, respectively, p < 0.05) with similar shortening in isolated t cells and monocytes and that this telomere attrition in caregivers was not due to an increase of shorter telomere possessing t cell subsets in pbmc.
