all urine void events were captured in full, and measured for metabolites of the high molecular weight (hmw) di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (dehp), di-isononyl phthalate (dinp) and di-isodecyl phthalate (didp), and the low molecular weight (lmw) di-n-butyl phthalate (dnbp), di-iso-butyl phthalate (dibp), butylbenzyl phthalate (bbzp), dimethyl phthalate (dmp), and diethyl phthalate (dep).
