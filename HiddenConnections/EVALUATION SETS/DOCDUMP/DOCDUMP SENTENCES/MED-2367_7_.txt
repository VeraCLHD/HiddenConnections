subjects from the top quintile of rhr (>79 bpm) had respectively a 74% (95% ci, 1.3-2.3), a 87% (95% ci: 0.98-3.6, p = 0.06) and a 72% (95% ci, 1.3-2.3) increased risk of total, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality compared to those from the lowest quintile (<62 bpm), after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and beta-blocker (bb) use in a cox regression analysis.
