only four of the patients who improved on the cmp-free diet had concomitant symptoms of suspected cmpa, but a medical history of cmpa was found in 15 of the 21 patients cured and in only one of the six patients whose condition had not improved (p < 0.05); in addition, in 15 of the 21 cured patients, results of one or more laboratory tests (specific ige, igg, anti-beta-lactoglobulin, circulating eosinophils) were positive at the time of diagnosis, indicating hypersensitivity, compared with one of the six patients whose condition did not improve (p < 0.05).
