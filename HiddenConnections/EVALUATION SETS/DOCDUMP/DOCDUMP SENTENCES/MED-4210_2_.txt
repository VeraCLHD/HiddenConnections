to test this hypothesis, 14 young lean offspring of type 2 diabetic parents, a model of in vivo insulin resistance with increased risk to develop diabetes, and 14 healthy subjects matched for anthropomorphic parameters and life habits were studied with 1) euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to assess whole body insulin sensitivity, 2) localized 1h nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy of the soleus (higher content of fiber type i, insulin sensitive) and tibialis anterior (higher content of fiber type iib, less insulin sensitive) muscles to assess intramyocellular triglyceride content, 3) 13c nmr of the calf subcutaneous adipose tissue to assess composition in saturated/unsaturated carbons of triglyceride fatty acid chains, and 4) dual x-ray energy absorption to assess body composition.
