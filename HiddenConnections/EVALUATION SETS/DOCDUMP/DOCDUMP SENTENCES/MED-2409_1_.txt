we assessed whether dietary nitrate might provide sustained blood pressure lowering in hypertensive patients.we randomly assigned 68 hypertensive patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to receive daily dietary supplementation for 4-weeks with either dietary nitrate (250ml daily, as beetroot juice) or a placebo (250ml daily, as nitrate-free beetroot juice) following a 2-week run-in period and followed by a 2-week wash-out.
