notably increased relative risks were observed for anencephalus (odds ratio [or] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.0 to 7.7), spina bifida (or = 4.1, 95% ci = 1.7 to 9.7), hydrocephalus (or = 2.3, 95% ci = 1.1 to 5.1), cleft lip (or = 2.2, 95% ci = 1.4 to 3.4), and undescended testicle (or = 1.8, 95% ci = 1.0 to 3.0).
