serum triglyceride levels (p = 0.01), fasting insulin concentrations (p < 0.01), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (p < 0.01) were significantly lower and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p < 0.01), circulating adiponectin (p < 0.01), mitochondrial dna copy number (p < 0.01), and telomere length (p < 0.01) were significantly higher in the habitual exercise group than in the sedentary group.
