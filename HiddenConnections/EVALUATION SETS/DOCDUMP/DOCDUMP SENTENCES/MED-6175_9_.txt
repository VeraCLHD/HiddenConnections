after stratification analysis was performed according to menopausal status, premenopausal women (5th v. 1st quintile, or, 0.44; 95 % ci, 0.24, 0.80; p for trend, 0.007) and postmenopausal women (5th v. 1st quintile, or, 0.32; 95 % ci, 0.13, 0.80; p for trend, 0.06) showed similar inverse associations between gim intake and the risk of breast cancer after an adjustment for potential confounders except dietary factors.
