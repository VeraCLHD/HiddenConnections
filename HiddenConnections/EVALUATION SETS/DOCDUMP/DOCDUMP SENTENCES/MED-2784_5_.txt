the meta-analyses showed that positive psychological well-being was associated with reduced mortality in both the healthy population (combined hazard ratio (hr) = 0.82; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.76-0.89; p < .001) and the disease population (combined hr = 0.98; ci = 0.95-1.00; p = .030) studies.
