after adjusting for multiple potential confounders, an inverted u-shaped association between sleep duration and delayed word recall test (dwrt) score, a validated measure of memory impairment, was found, with 7 to 8 h of habitual sleep duration showing the highest score (p-values for trend from 3 to 7 h and from 7 to ≥ 10 h were all ≤ 0.001).
