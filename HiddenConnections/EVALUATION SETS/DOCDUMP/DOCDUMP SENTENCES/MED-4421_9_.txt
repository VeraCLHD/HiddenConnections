multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that older age (or 1.048, 95% ci 1.004-1.094, p=0.03), severe necroinflammatory activity (or 3.325, 95% ci 1.347-8.209, p=0.009), moderate-severe steatosis (or 2.421, 95% ci 1.017-6.415, p=0.04), and industrial fructose intake (or 1.147, 95% ci 1.047-1.257, p=0.003) were independently linked to severe fibrosis.
