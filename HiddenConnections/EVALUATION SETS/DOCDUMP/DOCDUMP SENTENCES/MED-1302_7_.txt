results exercise decreased spirometry only in children with asthma, but increased (p<0.001) most types of leucocytes (eg lymphocytes (controls, mean (sd) 1210 (208) cells/μl; children with asthma, 1119 (147) cells/μl) and eosinophils (controls, 104 (22) cells/μl; children with asthma, 88 (20) cells/μl)) to the same degree in both groups.
