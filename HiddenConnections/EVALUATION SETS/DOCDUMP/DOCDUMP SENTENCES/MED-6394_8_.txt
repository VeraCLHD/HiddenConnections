finally, although the triptans are effective antimigraine agents producing selective cranial vasoconstriction, efforts are being made to develop other effective antimigraine alternatives acting via the direct blockade of vasodilator mechanisms (e.g. antagonists at cgrp receptors, antagonists at 5-ht7 receptors, inhibitors of nitric oxide biosynthesis, etc).
