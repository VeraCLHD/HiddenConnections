in a mean clinical follow-up of 4.6 ± 1.8 years, the composite cv events (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure or angina pectoris, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary interventions) were significantly more common in subjects with fmd ≤11.3% rather than >11.3% (15.2% vs 1.2%, p = 0.0001, respectively).
