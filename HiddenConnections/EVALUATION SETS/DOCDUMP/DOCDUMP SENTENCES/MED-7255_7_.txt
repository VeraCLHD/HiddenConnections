the o(2) cost of walking (0.87 ± 0.12 and 0.70 ± 0.10 l/min in pl and br, respectively, p < 0.01), moderate-intensity running (2.26 ± 0.27 and 2.10 ± 0.28 l/min in pl and br, respectively, p < 0.01), and severe-intensity running (end-exercise o(2) uptake = 3.77 ± 0.57 and 3.50 ± 0.62 l/min in pl and bl, respectively, p < 0.01) was reduced by br, and time to exhaustion during severe-intensity running was increased by 15% (7.6 ± 1.5 and 8.7 ± 1.8 min in pl and br, respectively, p < 0.01).
