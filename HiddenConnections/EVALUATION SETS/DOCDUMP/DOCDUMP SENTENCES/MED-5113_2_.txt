this activity was demonstrated (1) by the ability of mucin derived peptides to block the reaction of anti-gal alpha(1,3)gal antibodies and ib4 lectin with a gal alpha(1,3)gal+ pig endothelial cell line; the reactions were specific and did not occur with a random peptide containing the same sequences or with other mucin peptides; (2) by the fact that anti-mucin1 antibodies could react with the gal alpha(1,3)gal expressed after transfection of cos cells (gal alpha(1,3)gal-,muc1-) with cdna encoding the pig alpha, 3galactosyltransferase; and (3) that the ib4 lectin and anti-gal alpha(1,3)gal antibodies could react with mucin 1 found on the surface of human breast cancer cells.
