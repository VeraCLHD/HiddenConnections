main outcome measure: harmine labeled with carbon 11, a radioligand selective for mao-a and positron emission tomography, was used to measure mao-a dvs (specific distribution volume), an index of mao-a density, in different brain regions (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus, anterior temporal cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampus).
