serum ferritin and plasma hepcidin were correlated (r = 0.66; p<0.001) and both were significant predictors of iron bioavailability, but their combined effect explained only 30% of the inter-individual variation (p<0.001) and illustrates the current lack of understanding of mechanisms responsible for the fine-tuning of iron absorption.
