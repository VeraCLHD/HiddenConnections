in some taxa, spines might stimulate reproductive readiness and synchrony in situations in which the sexes live apart and do not have other means of communicating reproductive state (dispersed social systems and 'stolen' extra-pair copulations), but problems exist with the hypothesis, as they do with the idea that spines are involved with scent marking.
