an increase in adherence to an animal‐based lcd prospectively assessed from the pre‐ to post‐mi period was associated with higher all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratios of 1.30 [95% ci: 1.03 to 1.65] for all‐cause mortality and 1.53 [95% ci: 1.10 to 2.13] for cardiovascular mortality comparing extreme quintiles).
