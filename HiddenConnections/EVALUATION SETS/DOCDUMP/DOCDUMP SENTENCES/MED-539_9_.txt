in the 7 controlled trials (a total of 311 participants; mean age, 44.5 years), consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with a reduction in mean systolic bp (-4.8 mm hg; 95% ci, -6.6 to -3.1; p < .001; i2 = 0; p = .45 for heterogeneity) and diastolic bp (-2.2 mm hg; 95% ci, -3.5 to -1.0; p < .001; i2 = 0; p = .43 for heterogeneity) compared with the consumption of omnivorous diets.
