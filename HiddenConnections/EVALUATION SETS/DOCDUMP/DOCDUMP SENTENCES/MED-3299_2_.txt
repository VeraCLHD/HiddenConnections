result: in the exposed fetuses, ductal velocities were higher (systolic: 0.96±0.23 m/s; diastolic: 0.17±0.05 m/s) and right-to-left ventricular ratio was higher (1.23±0.23) than in unexposed fetuses (systolic: 0.61±0.18 m/s, p<0.001; diastolic: 0.11±0.04 m/s, p=0.011; right-to-left ventricular ratio: 0.94±0.14, p<0.001).
