we have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) with significant differences in allele frequencies between broilers and layers in each of the following six candidate genes: adrenergic, beta-2-, receptor, surface (adrb2); melanocortin 5 receptor (mc5r); leptin receptor (lepr), mckusick-kaufman syndrome (mkks), milk fat globule-egf factor 8 protein (mfge8) and adenylate kinase 1 (ak1).
