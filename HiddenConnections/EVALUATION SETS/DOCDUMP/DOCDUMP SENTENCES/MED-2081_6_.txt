low sodium markedly enhanced no- mediated edd (greater δfbfach with endothelial no synthase [enos] inhibition) without changing enos expression/activation (ser1177 phosphorylation), restored bh4 bioactivity (less δfmdba with acute bh4), abolished tonic superoxide suppression of edd (less δfmdba and δfbfach with ascorbic acid infusion), and increased circulating superoxide dismutase activity (p<0.05).
