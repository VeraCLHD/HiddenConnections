mechanism studies were performed using rat liver s9 in assays for methoxyresorufin o-demethylase (mrod), a marker for the enzyme cytochrome p4501a2 that activates heterocyclic amines, as well as salmonella assays with the direct-acting mutagen 2-hydroxyamino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (n-hydroxy-iq).
