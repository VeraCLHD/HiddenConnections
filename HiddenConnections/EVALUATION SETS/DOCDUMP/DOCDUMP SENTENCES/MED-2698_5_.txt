results compared with the control condition, sucralose ingestion caused 1) a greater incremental increase in peak plasma glucose concentrations (4.2 ± 0.2 vs. 4.8 ± 0.3 mmol/l; p = 0.03), 2) a 20 ± 8% greater incremental increase in insulin area under the curve (auc) (p < 0.03), 3) a 22 ± 7% greater peak insulin secretion rate (p < 0.02), 4) a 7 ± 4% decrease in insulin clearance (p = 0.04), and 5) a 23 ± 20% decrease in si (p = 0.01).
