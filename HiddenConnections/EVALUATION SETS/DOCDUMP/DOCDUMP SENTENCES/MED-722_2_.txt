metabolic signals of western diet are sensed by the nutrient-sensitive kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), which integrates signals of cellular energy, growth factors (insulin, igf-1) and protein-derived signals, predominantly leucine, provided in high amounts by milk proteins and meat.
