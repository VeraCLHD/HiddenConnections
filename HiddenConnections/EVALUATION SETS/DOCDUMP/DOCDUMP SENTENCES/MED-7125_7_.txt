the inverse association between ala and depression was stronger in women with low linoleic acid (la) intake (p for interaction = 0.02): a 0.5-g/d increment in ala was inversely associated with depression in the first, second, and third la quintiles [rr (95% ci): 0.57 (0.37, 0.87), 0.62 (0.41, 0.93), and 0.68 (0.47, 0.96), respectively] but not in the fourth and fifth quintiles.
