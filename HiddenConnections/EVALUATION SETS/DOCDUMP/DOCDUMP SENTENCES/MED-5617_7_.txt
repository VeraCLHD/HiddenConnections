in contrast, after exposure to 2500 (sd 500) lx light (420-800 nm) for 12 h, rpe cells in the positive control (light exposure, no bae treatment) exhibited premature senescence, low (p < 0·01) cell viability and increased (p < 0·01) vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) release compared with negative control cells, which were not subjected to light irradiation and bae exposure.
