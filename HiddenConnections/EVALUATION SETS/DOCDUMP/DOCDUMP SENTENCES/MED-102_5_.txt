among rct, weighted mean differences in post-intervention circulating concentrations of fasting glucose and total and ldl-cholesterol comparing whole-grain intervention groups with controls indicated significantly lower concentrations after whole-grain interventions [differences in fasting glucose: -0.93 mmol/l (95% ci: -1.65, -0.21), total cholesterol: -0.83 mmol/l (-1.23, -0.42); and ldl-cholesterol: -0.82 mmol/l (-1.31, -0.33)].
