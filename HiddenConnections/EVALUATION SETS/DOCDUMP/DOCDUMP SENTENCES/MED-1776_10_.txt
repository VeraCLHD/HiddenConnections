in the other blood pressure difference trials (excluding chd events in trials of Î² blockers in people with chd), there was a 22% reduction in chd events (17% to 27%) and a 41% (33% to 48%) reduction in stroke for a blood pressure reduction of 10 mm hg systolic or 5 mm hg diastolic, similar to the reductions of 25% (chd) and 36% (stroke) expected for the same difference in blood pressure from the cohort study meta-analysis, indicating that the benefit is explained by blood pressure reduction itself.
