exogenous addition of antioxidants, glutathione (gsh) and n-acetyl-cysteine (nac) inhibited the anti-proliferative ability of tpl in both mcf 7 and t47 d. annexin-v and propidium iodide double staining of cells treated with tpl for 2h revealed that tpl induced significant apoptosis in both the cell lines in a dose dependant manner but magnitude of apoptosis was significantly higher in mcf 7 than in t 47-d cells.
