fecal concentrations of total and secondary bile acids were significantly lower during the high-rs than during the low-rs period [a decrease of 30% (p < or = 0.05) and 32% (p < or = 0.01), respectively, in total and secondary bile acids] whereas concentrations of primary bile acids were unaffected by rs consumption.
