prostate cancer risk was, respectively, 14% and 16% greater in the highest fifth of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) (or = 1.14, 95% ci = 1.01 to 1.29, p trend = .001) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) (or = 1.16, 95% ci = 1.02 to 1.33, p trend = .003), but in each case there was heterogeneity between studies (p = .022 and p < .001, respectively).
