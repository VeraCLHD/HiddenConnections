results: multivariate cox regression analyses showed that the inclusion of fbg did not add significant information on the prediction of 2h-bg alone (p>.10 for various causes), whereas the addition of 2h-bg to fbg criteria significantly improved the prediction (p<.001 for all causes and p<.005 for cardiovascular disease).
