in an initial, randomized controlled study on elderly subjects with increased dementia risk (mild cognitive impairment according to 2004 petersen criteria), we showed that high-dose b-vitamin treatment (folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin b6 20 mg, vitamin b12 0.5 mg) slowed shrinkage of the whole brain volume over 2 y. here, we go further by demonstrating that b-vitamin treatment reduces, by as much as seven fold, the cerebral atrophy in those gray matter (gm) regions specifically vulnerable to the ad process, including the medial temporal lobe.
