abstract routine exposure to artificial light at night (alan) in work, home, and community settings is linked with increased risk of breast and prostate cancer (bc, pc) in normally sighted women and men, the hypothesized biological rhythm mechanisms being frequent nocturnal melatonin synthesis suppression, circadian time structure (cts) desynchronization, and sleep/wake cycle disruption with sleep deprivation.
