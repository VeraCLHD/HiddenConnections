the average particle size distribution curves of raw and cooked carrots, which were chewed by 15 persons, could be mimicked by mixing 50 g of carrots using a grindomix (retsch) at 2500 rpm during 5 s. based on this scientific knowledge, the identified in vitro mastication technique was successfully integrated in the in vitro digestion procedure determining the all-e-Î²-carotene bioaccessibility of carrot samples.
