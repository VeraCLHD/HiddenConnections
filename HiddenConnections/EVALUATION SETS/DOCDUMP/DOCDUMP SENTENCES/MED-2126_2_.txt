results the strongest associations with later diagnosis of pd were found for having a first-degree or any relative with pd (odds ratio [or], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.65–3.93 and or, 4.45; 95% ci, 3.39–5.83) or any relative with tremor (or, 2.74; 95% ci, 2.10–3.57), constipation (relative risk [rr], 2.34; 95% ci, 1.55–3.53), or lack of smoking history (current vs never: rr, 0.44; 95% ci, 0.39–0.50), each at least doubling the risk of pd.
