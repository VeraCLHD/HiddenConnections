methods: heart rate (hr), brachial systolic bp (bsbp), brachial pulse pressure (bpp), aortic sbp (asbp), aortic pp (app), augmentation index (aix), aix adjusted for hr of 75 beats/min (aix@75), amplitude of the first (p1) and second (p2) systolic peaks, reflection time (tr), and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (pwv) were evaluated in the supine position in nine subjects (four men/five women, age 54 ± 3 years) with prehypertension (134/77 ± 5/3 mm hg).
