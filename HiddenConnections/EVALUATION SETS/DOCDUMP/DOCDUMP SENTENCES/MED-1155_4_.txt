fibroblast-like synoviocytes (fls) were isolated from early and late oa tissue samples to compare in vitro production of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) results: synovial tissue from patients with early oa demonstrated significantly greater cd4+ (p = 0.017) and cd68+ (p<0.001) cell infiltration, blood vessel formation (p = 0.01), vascular endothelial growth factor (p = 0.001), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression (p<0.001).
