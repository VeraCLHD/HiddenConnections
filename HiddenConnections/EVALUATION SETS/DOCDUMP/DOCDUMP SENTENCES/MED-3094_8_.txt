potential mechanisms involved include, but are not limited to, direct effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on monoamine levels, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, pathologic microglial cell activation, impaired neuroplasticity and structural and functional brain changes.
