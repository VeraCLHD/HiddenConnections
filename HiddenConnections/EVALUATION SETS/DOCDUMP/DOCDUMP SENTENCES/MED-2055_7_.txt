taking the amplitude-dependent speed of sound as a dependent variable, and age, bmi, gonadal status, intake of beer and wine, and number of cigarettes per day as independent variables, we found age (beta = -1.52), bmi (beta = -3.86), gonadal status (beta = -27.47), and beer intake (beta = 1.06) to be significant.
