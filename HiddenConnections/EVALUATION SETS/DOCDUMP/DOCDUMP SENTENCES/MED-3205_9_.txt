results: increases were found in natural killer cell activity (p < .01); immunoglobulins g (p < .02), a (p < .01), and m (p < .09), with several immunoglobulin effects lasting 12 hours into recovery from initiation of the humor intervention; functional phenotypic markers for leukocyte subsets such as activated t cells (p < .01), active cytotoxic t cells (p < .01), natural killer cells (p = .09), b cells (p < .01), helper t cells (p < .02), uncommitted t cells with helper and suppressor markers (p < .02), helper/suppressor ratio (p = .10) with several leukocyte subset increase effects lasting 12 hours after the humor experience; the cytokine interferon-gamma (p = .02), with increases lasting 12 hours; total leukocytes (p < .05), with specific subpopulation lymphocytes during the intervention (p < .01) and 90 minutes into recovery (p < .05); and granulocytes during the intervention (p < .05) and 90 minutes following the intervention (p < .01).
