in the 32 observational studies (a total of 21,604 participants; mean age, 46.6 years), consumption of vegetarian diets was associated with lower mean systolic bp (-6.9 mm hg; 95% ci, -9.1 to -4.7; p < .001; i2 = 91.4; p < .001 for heterogeneity) and diastolic bp (-4.7 mm hg; 95% ci, -6.3 to -3.1; p < .001; i2 = 92.6; p < .001 for heterogeneity) compared with the consumption of omnivorous diets.
