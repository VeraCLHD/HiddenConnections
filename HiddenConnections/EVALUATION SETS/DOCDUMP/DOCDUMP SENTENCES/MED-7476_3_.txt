exposure of cells to licorice or la resulted in several confirmed characteristics of autophagy, including the appearance of autophagic vacuoles revealed by monodansylcadaverine (mdc) staining, formation of acidic vesicular organelles (avos), and autophagosome membrane association of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (lc3) characterized by cleavage of lc3 and its punctuate redistribution, as well as ultrastructural observation of autophagic vacuoles by transmission electron microscopy.
