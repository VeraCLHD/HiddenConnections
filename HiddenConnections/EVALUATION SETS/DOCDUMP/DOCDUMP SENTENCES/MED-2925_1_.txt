in the belgian salt intervention trial, a controlled 5-y intervention in two belgian towns resulted in a reduction in urinary sodium of 17 mmol/24 h (p < 0.001) in adult (aged > or = 20 y) women in the intervention town, which differed from the concurrent trend (an increase of 8 mmol/24 h) in the control town (p = 0.01).
