in a regression model of predictors of weight change, including diet group and changes in energy intake, thermic effect of food, resting metabolic rate, and reported energy expenditure, significant effects were found for diet group (p < .05), thermic effect of food (p < .05), and resting metabolic rate (p < .001).
