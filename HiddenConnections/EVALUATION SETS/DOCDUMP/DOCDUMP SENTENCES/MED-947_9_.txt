while the content of hcas in dishes consumed in ordinary life is low and not sufficient in itself to explain human cancer, the coexistence of many other mutagens/carcinogens of either autobiotic or xenobiotic type and the possibility that hcas induce genomic instability and heightened sensitivity to tumor promoters suggest that avoidance of exposure to hcas or reduction of hcas' biological effects as far as possible are to be highly recommended.
