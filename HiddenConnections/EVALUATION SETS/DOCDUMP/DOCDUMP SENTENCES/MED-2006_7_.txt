eight derivatives of bpa (three diphenylalkanes with different substituents at the central carbon atom, three diphenylalkanes with ester bonds on hydroxyl groups in the phenolic rings, one bisphenol consisting of a sulphur atom at the central position, one chemical with cyanic groups, instead of hydroxyl groups, in the phenolic rings) accelerated terminal adipocyte differentiation and their potencies to increase tg accumulation were 73-97% of that of bpa.
