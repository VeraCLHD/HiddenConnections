experiments were carried out on primary cultures of human granulosa-luteal (gl) cells after they had been exposed to phytoestrogens for 48 h. aromatase activity was measured by the ability of cells to convert testosterone to estradiol over a 4h period and aromatase mrna expression (mrna(arom)) was subsequently measured from the same cells using quantitative real-time pcr.
