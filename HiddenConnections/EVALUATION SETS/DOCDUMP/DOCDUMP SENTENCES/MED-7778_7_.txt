strong inverse associations with adiponectin were observed for bmi (-10.72%; 95% ci: -13.78, -7.55), total (-6.89%: 95% ci: -10.34, -3.30; p < 0.05), and central fat mass (-12.50%; 95% ci: -15.82, -9.05; p < 0.05); these relationships were significant both when twins were analyzed as individuals and when characteristics were contrasted within-twin pairs, suggesting a direct effect.
