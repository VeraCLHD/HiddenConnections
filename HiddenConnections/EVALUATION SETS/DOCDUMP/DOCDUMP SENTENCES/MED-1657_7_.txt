results: adjusted means of tc, ldlc, tc/hdlc, ldlc/hdlc, and non-hdlc (defined as tc-hdlc) were significantly higher in subjects with nps, even in sparse to moderate stages (cerad = 1 or 2), compared to subjects without nps in multivariate models including apoe Îµ4 carrier and other confounding factors.
