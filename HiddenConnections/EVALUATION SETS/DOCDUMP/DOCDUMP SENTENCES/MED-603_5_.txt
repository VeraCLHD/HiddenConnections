compared with the starch-based and low-fat diets, the high-fiber vegetable diet resulted in the largest reduction in low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol (33% +/- 4%, p <.001) and the greatest fecal bile acid output (1.13 +/- 0.30 g/d, p =.002), fecal bulk (906 +/- 130 g/d, p <.001), and fecal short-chain fatty acid outputs (78 +/- 13 mmol/d, p <.001).
