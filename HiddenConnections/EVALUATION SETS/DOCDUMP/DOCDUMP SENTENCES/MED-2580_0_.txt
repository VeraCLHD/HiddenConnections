abstract long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa) namely arachidonic acid (ara, 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (dha, 22:6n-3) are highly concentrated in the phospholipid bilayer of biologically active brain and retinal neural membranes and are important in phototransduction and neuronal function.
