results: we observed linear increase in risk of death associated with increasing number of high-risk practices: compared with men who had no high-risk practices, multivariate rrs for men who had 1 to 4 practices were 1.20, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.96, respectively (p for trend<0.001), and corresponding rrs for women were 1.31, 2.14, 3.98, 5.56, respectively (p for trend<0.001).
