in people aged 50-59 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol (about 3 g of salt), attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would, after a few weeks, lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm hg, and by 7 mm hg in those with high blood pressure (170 mm hg); diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as much.
