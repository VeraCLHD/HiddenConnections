the ability of whole bran fractions of differing particle size distributions to inhibit free radicals was assessed using four in vitro models, namely, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, ferric reducing/antioxidant power (frap) assay, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac), and total antioxidant capacity.
