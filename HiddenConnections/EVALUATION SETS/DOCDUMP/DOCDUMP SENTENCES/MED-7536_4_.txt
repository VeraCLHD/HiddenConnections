here we show, using a sensitive assay we developed, that the reduction of folic acid by dhfr per gram of human liver (n = 6) obtained from organ donors or directly from surgery is, on average, less than 2% of that in rat liver at physiological ph. moreover, in contrast to rats, there was almost a 5-fold variation of dhfr activity among the human samples.
