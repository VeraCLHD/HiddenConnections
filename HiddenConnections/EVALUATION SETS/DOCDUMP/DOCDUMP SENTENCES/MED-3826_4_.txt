conversely, total meat intake was associated with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (or = 1.43, 95% ci = 1.11, 1.83), gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (or = 1.37, 95% ci = 1.08, 1.73), and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (or = 1.39, 95% ci = 1.12, 1.71), with red meat most strongly associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma risk (or = 2.49, 95% ci = 1.39, 4.46).
