after adjustment for mrsa risk factors, the highest quartile of swine crop field exposure was significantly associated with community-associated mrsa, healthcare-associated mrsa, and skin and soft tissue infection case status (adjusted odds ratio, 1.38 [95% ci, 1.13–1.69], 1.30 [95% ci, 1.05–1.61], and 1.37 [95% ci, 1.18–1.60], respectively); and there was a trend of increasing odds across quartiles for each outcome (all p for trend ≤0.01).
