in pooled multivariate-adjusted analyses, participants in the highest quintile of anthocyanin intake (predominantly from blueberries and strawberries) had an 8% reduction in risk of hypertension [relative risk (rr): 0.92; 95% ci: 0.86, 0.98; p < 0.03] compared with that for participants in the lowest quintile of anthocyanin intake; the risk reduction was 12% (rr: 0.88; 95% ci: 0.84, 0.93; p < 0.001) in participants â‰¤60 y of age and 0.96 (0.91, 1.02) in participants >60 y of age (p for age interaction = 0.02).
