the results of molecular analyses indicated that the expression of the adipogenesis-associated genes dual leucine zipper-bearing kinase (dlk (map3k12)), igf1, ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha (c/ebpα (cebpa)), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pparγ (pparg)), and lipoprotein lipase (lpl) was temporally accelerated and increased by bpa.
