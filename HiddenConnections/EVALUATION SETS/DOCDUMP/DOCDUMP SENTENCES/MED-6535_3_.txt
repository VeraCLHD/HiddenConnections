ch(3)-cv was shown to cause a significant induction of oxidative stress, as revealed by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (ldcl) and to alter dramatically the expression of cyp2e1, inos and mn-sod, indicating that the toxic effect of ch(3)-cv could be mediated through a nitric oxide dependent mechanism.
