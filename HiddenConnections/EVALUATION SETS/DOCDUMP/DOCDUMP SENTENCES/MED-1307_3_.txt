in addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, we found that postexercise plasma collected after blackcurrant supplementation enhanced the differential temporal lps-stimulated inflammatory response in thp-1 cells, resulting in an early suppression of tnf-alpha (1,741 +/- 32 vs. 1,312 +/- 42 pg/ml, placebo vs. blackcurrant, p < 0.05) and il-6 (44 +/- 5 vs. 36 +/- 3 pg/ml, placebo vs. blackcurrant, p < 0.05) secretion after 24 h. furthermore, by using an oxidative stress cell model, we found that preincubation of thp-1 cells with hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) prior to extract exposure caused a greater suppression of lps-stimulated cytokine secretion after 24 h, which was not evident when cells were simultaneously incubated with h(2)o(2) and the extract.
