both systolic and diastolic bp were lower in the low-calorie low-protein vegan diet group (104 +/- 15 and 62 +/- 11 mm hg) than in bmi-matched endurance runners (122 +/- 13 and 72 +/- 9 mmhg) and western diet group (132 +/- 14 and 79 +/- 8 mm hg) (p < 0.001); bp values were directly associated with sodium intake and inversely associated with potassium and fiber intake.
