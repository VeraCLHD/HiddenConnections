the results support literature observations on the preferential accumulation of contaminants in liver tissue, as the highest concentrations of pcdd/fs were observed in liver, relative to the other organs (e.g. 8.4 ng who-teq kg(-1) lamb liver compared to 1.1 ng who-teq kg(-1) lamb kidney and 1.27 ng who-teq kg(-1) lamb heart).
