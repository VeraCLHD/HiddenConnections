results: the nitric oxide synthase (nos) inhibitor n(omega)-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) induced significant pressor responses following cocoa administration only among the older subjects: systolic blood pressure (sbp) rose 13 +/- 4 mmhg, diastolic blood pressure (dbp) 6 +/- 2 mmhg (p = 0.008 and 0.047, respectively); sbp was significantly higher in the older subjects (p < 0.05).
