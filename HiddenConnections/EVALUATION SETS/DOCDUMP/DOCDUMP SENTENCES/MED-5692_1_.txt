materials and methods: cardiac and pulmonary 64-detector ct angiography was performed by using current clinical protocols to evaluate the pulmonary veins (electrocardiographically [ecg] gated, 64 sections at 0.625-mm collimation, 120 kvp, 300 ma, 0.35-second tube rotation), native coronary arteries (ecg gated; 64 sections at 0.625 mm; 120 kvp; maximum current, 500-750 ma; minimum, 100-350 ma; 0.35-second tube rotation) and pulmonary embolus (64 sections at 1.25 mm, 140 kvp, 645 ma, 0.5-second tube rotation).
