our data demonstrate that pathologic mineralization defects of bone occur in patients with a serum 25(oh)d below 75 nmol/l and strongly argue that in conjunction with a sufficient calcium intake, the dose of vitamin d supplementation should ensure that circulating levels of 25(oh)d reach this minimum threshold (75 nmol/l or 30 ng/ml) to maintain skeletal health.
