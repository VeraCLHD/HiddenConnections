abstract gel filtration chromatography, ultra-filtration, and solid-phase extraction silica gel clean-up were evaluated for their ability to remove microcystins selectively from extracts of cyanobacteria spirulina samples after using the reversed-phase octadecylsilyl ods cartridge for subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms).
