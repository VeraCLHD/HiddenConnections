compared to baseline levels, higher enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid in erythrocyte lipids (244% vs 217%) and lower formation of leukotriene b(4) (34% vs 8%, p>0.01), 11-dehydro-thromboxane b(2) (15% vs 10%, p<0.05), and prostaglandin metabolites (21% vs 16%, p<0.003) were found in aid patients, especially when fish oil was given during months 6-8 of the experiment.
