subgroup analyses revealed that ad36-seropositivity was associated with better baseline glycemic control and lower fasting insulin levels over time in the normal-weight group (bmi ≤25 kg/m2) and longitudinally, with greater adiposity in the overweight (bmi 25–30 kg/m2) and obese (bmi >30 kg/m2) men.
