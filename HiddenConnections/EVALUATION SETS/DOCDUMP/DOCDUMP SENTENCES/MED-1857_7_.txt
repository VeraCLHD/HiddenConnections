there was a trend toward a smaller size of largest polyp in patients treated with aspirin versus non-aspirinâ€”mean 3.8 mm versus 5.5 mm for patients treated one or more years (adjusted p = 0.09) and mean 3.0 mm versus 6.0 mm for patients treated more than one year (p = 0.02); there were weaker such trends with rs versus non-rs.
