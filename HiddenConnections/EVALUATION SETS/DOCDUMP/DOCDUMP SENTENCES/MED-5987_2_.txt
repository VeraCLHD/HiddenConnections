however, aortic fatty streaks were strongly related to antemortem levels of both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.67, p less than 0.0001 for each association), independently of race, sex, and age, and were inversely correlated with the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density plus very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.35, p = 0.06).
