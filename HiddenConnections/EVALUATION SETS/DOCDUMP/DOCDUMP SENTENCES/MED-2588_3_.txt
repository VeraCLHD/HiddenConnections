in these studies, greater differences were found between breast-fed and standard formula-fed infants, the latter showing low tissue long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lcpufa: arachidonic acid, aa, 20:4n-6; eicosapentaenoic acid, epa, 20:5n-3; docosahexaenoic acid, dha, 22:6n-3) accretion and lower visual and neurodevelopmental test scores.
