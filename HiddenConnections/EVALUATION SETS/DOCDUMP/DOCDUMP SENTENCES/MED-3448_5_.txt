results: after adjustment for potential confounding factors, dietary fiber showed linear associations from lowest to highest quintiles of intake with the following: body weight (whites: 174.8-166.7 lb [78.3-75.0 kg], p<.001; blacks: 185.6-177.6 lb [83.5-79.9 kg], p = .001), waist-to-hip ratio (whites: 0.813-0.801, p = .004; blacks: 0.809-0.799, p = .05), fasting insulin adjusted for body mass index (whites: 77.8-72.2 pmol/l [11.2-10.4 microu/ml], p = .007; blacks: 92.4-82.6 pmol/l [13.3-11.9 microu/ml], p = .01) and 2-hour postglucose insulin adjusted for body mass index (whites: 261.1-234.7 pmol/l [37.6-33.8 microu/ml], p = .03; blacks: 370.2-259.7 pmol/l [53.3-37.4 microu/ml], p<.001).
