concentrations of sulfide, ammonia, and lowry-reactive substances were measured over 48 h. results: mean (+/-sem) fecal sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.22 +/- 0.02 mmol/kg with the 0-g/d diet to 3.38 +/- 0.31 mmol/kg with the 600-g/d diet and were significantly related to meat intake (p: < 0.001).
