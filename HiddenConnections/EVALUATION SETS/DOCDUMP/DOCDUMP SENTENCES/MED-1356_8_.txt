after adjustment for potential baseline confounders (sex, age, disease duration, and edss score), exposure to interferon beta was not associated with a statistically significant difference in the hazard of reaching an edss score of 6 when either the contemporary control cohort (hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% ci, 0.92-1.83; p = .14) or the historical control cohort (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% ci, 0.58-1.02; p = .07) were considered.
