intake of long-chain n−3 fatty acids from fish was not associated with depression risk [relative risk (rr) for 0.3-g/d increment: 0.99; 95% ci: 0.88, 1.10], whereas α-linolenic acid (ala) intake was inversely associated with depression risk (multivariate rr for 0.5-g/d increment: 0.82; 95% ci: 0.71, 0.94).
