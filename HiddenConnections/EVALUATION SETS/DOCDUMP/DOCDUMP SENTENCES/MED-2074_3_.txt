to determine whether zeranol and estradiol-17beta play a role in the neoplastic transformation of human breast and to compare the estrogenic potency of zeranol to that of estradiol-17beta in human breast, we treated human breast epithelial cell mcf-10a with different doses of zeranol or estradiol-17beta for 10 repeated treatment cycles.
