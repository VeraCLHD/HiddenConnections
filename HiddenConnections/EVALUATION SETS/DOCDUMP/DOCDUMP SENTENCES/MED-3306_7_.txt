higher likelihood of sr was observed among women with higher arachidonic acid [aa (20:4n-6): or=1.45, 95% ci 1.02-2.07] and adrenic acid [ada (22:4 n-6): or=1.43, 95% ci 1.01-2.04], and for mde: aa [or=1.47, 95% ci 1.03-2.10], and ada [or=1.59, 95% ci 1.09-2.32], per standard deviation of fatty acid, in adjusted logistic regressions.
