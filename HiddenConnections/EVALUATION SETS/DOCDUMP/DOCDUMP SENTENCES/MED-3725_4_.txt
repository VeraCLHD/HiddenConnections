estimated average systolic bp differences associated with two s.d. differences in raw vegetable intake (68 g per 1000 kcal) and cooked vegetable intake (92 g per 1000 kcal) were −1.9 mm hg (95% confidence interval (ci): −3.1, −0.8; p=0.001) and −1.3 mm hg (95% ci: −2.5, −0.2; p=0.03) without body mass index (bmi) in the full model; −1.3 mm hg (95% ci: −2.4, −0.2; p=0.02) and −0.9 mm hg (95% ci: −2.0, 0.2; p=0.1) with additional adjustment for bmi.
