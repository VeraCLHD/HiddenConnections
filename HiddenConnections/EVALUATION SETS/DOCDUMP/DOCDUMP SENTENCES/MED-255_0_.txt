abstract eight young men (group a) underwent 5 h of quiet sitting, preceded by 30 min of recumbency, 20 min of standing, and 20 s of walking, and five other young men (group b) underwent 70 min of sitting, preceded by recumbency only, to determine the effects of prolonged sitting and previous posture on hemodynamic responses (measured by impedance plethysmography).
