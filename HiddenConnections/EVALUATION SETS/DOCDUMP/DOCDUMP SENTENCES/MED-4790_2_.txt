in this study, changes in gene expression induced by these three interventions in cultured "intestinal porcine epithelial cells" (ipec-j2) recorded after a short-term period of 2 and 6 hours, were compared to the in vivo gene expression profiles in order to evaluate the capability of this in vitro bioassay in predicting in vivo responses.
