to examine the systematic effects of l. barbarum on immune function, general well-being, and safety, we tested the effects of a standardized l. barbarum fruit juice (gochi, freelife international, phoenix, az, usa) at 120 ml/day, equivalent to at least 150 g of fresh fruit, the amount traditionally used, or placebo for 30 days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in 60 older healthy adults (55-72 years old).
