the age-diet, but not the cl-diet, produced distinct elevations in serum age levels in direct proportion to amount ingested (r = 0.8, p < 0.05): the area under the curve for serum (≈10% of ingested age) correlated directly with severity of kd; renal excretion of dietary age, although normally incomplete (only ≈30% of amount absorbed), in dm it correlated inversely with degree of albuminuria, and directly with creatinine clearance (r = 0.8, p < 0.05), reduced to <5% in dm with renal failure.
