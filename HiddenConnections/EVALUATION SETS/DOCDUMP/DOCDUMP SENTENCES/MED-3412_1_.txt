to investigate how dietary fat influences risk, we compared the colonic contents of 12 adult high-risk african americans (aas) and 10 caucasian americans (cas) who consumed a high-fat diet (123 ± 11 g/d and 129 ± 17 g/d, respectively) to 13 native africans (nas) who subsisted on a low-fat (38 ± 3.0 g/d) diet, all aged 50-60 yr.
