therapies that predispose people to pml can be classified into three categories: therapies that uniquely increase the risk for the disorder, such as the monoclonal antibodies natalizumab and efalizumab; therapies that appear to increase the risk in individuals already at risk of pml due to pre-existing conditions, such as rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil; and therapies with a mechanism of action that might suggest a potential for increased pml risk and/or with which rare cases of pml have been observed.
