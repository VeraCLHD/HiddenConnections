after multivariate adjustment, a high consumption of red meat was related to higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (hr) = 1.14, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.01 to 1.28, 160+ versus 10 to 19.9 g/day), and the association was stronger for processed meat (hr = 1.44, 95% ci 1.24 to 1.66, 160+ versus 10 to 19.9 g/day).
