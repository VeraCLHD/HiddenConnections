the total phenolic contents were determined by the folin-ciocalteu method and the antioxidant activities assessed by the ability to quench the stable free radical 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) and to inhibit the 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (aaph)-induced oxidative hemolysis of human erythrocytes.
