results: the geometric mean (standard deviation) of concentrations of bpa were 1.72 (5.5) ng/ml after controlling for confounding factors, linear regression analyzes showed a 1-unit increase in natural log bpa was significantly associated with an increase in mean cimt (mm) (β = 0.005, 95% c.i. = 0.003-0.007, p < 0.001) and other measurement of cimt (including right and left side of common carotid artery, carotid bulb and internal carotid artery).
