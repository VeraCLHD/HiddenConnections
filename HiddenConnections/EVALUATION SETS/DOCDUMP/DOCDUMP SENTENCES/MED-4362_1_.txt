the present meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether individuals assigned to a vlckd (i.e. a diet with no more than 50 g carbohydrates/d) achieve better long-term body weight and cardiovascular risk factor management when compared with individuals assigned to a conventional low-fat diet (lfd; i.e. a restricted-energy diet with less than 30% of energy from fat).
