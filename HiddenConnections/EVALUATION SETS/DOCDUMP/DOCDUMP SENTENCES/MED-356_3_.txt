the endothelial performance was estimated by endothelium-dependent fmd (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery before and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingestion of a cup of caffeinated coffee (80 mg of caffeine) or the corresponding decaffeinated beverage (< 2 mg of caffeine) in two separate sessions, following a randomized single-blind cross-over design.
