available data indicate that (1) vitamin d's canonical function, optimizing intestinal calcium absorption, is fully expressed at serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25ohd) concentration of approximately 80nmol/l; (2) elevated parathyroid activity, typical of aging populations, is minimized at the same 25ohd value and (3) osteoporotic fractures are reduced when serum 25ohd is raised to near 80nmol/l.
