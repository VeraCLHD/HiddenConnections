heat treatments including industrial htst were simulated on a pilot scale with 22 different time-temperature combinations, including 60 to 90°c at holding (mean residence) times of 6 to 15 s. following 72°c and a holding time of 6 s, 70°c for 10 and 15 s, or under more stringent conditions, no viable m. avium subsp.
