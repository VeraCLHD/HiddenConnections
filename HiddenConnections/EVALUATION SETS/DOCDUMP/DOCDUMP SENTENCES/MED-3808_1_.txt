the presence of smell loss and the pathological involvement of the olfactory pathways in the formative stages of alzheimer's and parkinson's diseases, together with evidence that xenobiotics, some epidemiologically linked to these diseases, can readily enter the brain via the olfactory mucosa, have led to the hypothesis that alzheimer's and parkinson's diseases may be caused or catalyzed by agents that enter the brain via this route.
