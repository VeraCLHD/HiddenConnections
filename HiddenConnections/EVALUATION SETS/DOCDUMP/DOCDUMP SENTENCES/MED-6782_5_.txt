these biological changes were accompanied by biochemical and molecular changes, including upregulated h-ras gene expression, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathway activation, nox-1 expression, reactive oxygen species (ros) elevation, increased hif-1α, sp1, tumor necrosis factor-α, matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-2, mmp-9, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and reduced e-cadherin.
