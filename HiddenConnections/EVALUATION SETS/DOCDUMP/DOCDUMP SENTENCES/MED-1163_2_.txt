modern science has revealed that curcumin mediates its effects by modulation of several important molecular targets, including transcription factors (e.g., nf-kappab, ap-1, egr-1, beta-catenin, and ppar-gamma), enzymes (e.g., cox2, 5-lox, inos, and hemeoxygenase-1), cell cycle proteins (e.g., cyclin d1 and p21), cytokines (e.g., tnf, il-1, il-6, and chemokines), receptors (e.g., egfr and her2), and cell surface adhesion molecules.
