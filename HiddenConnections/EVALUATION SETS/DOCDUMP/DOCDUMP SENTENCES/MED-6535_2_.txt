the aim of the present study was to determine whether pure methylchavicol applied on a human hepatoma cell line, hepg2, could promote oxidative stress and might alter the expression of procarcinogenic biomarkers such as the drug-metabolizing enzyme (cyp2e1), the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (inos) and might induce the expression of cu/zn-superoxide dismutase (cu/zn-sod) and mn-sod that control the redox equilibrium of the cells.
