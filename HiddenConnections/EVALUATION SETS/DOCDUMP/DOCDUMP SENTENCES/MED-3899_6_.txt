results: incidence rate ratios and confidence intervals (cis) for interquartile range increases in concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichlorethane (ddt), cis-nonachlor, and oxychlordane were 1.35 (95% ci: 1.10, 1.66), 1.13 (95% ci: 0.94, 1.36), and 1.11 (95% ci: 0.89, 1.38), respectively, with monotonic doseâ€“response trends for ddt and cis-nonachlor based on categorical models.
