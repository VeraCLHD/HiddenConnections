in the chronic study grf, rpf and fractional clearance of albumin and igg were significantly higher on the animal than the vegetable protein diets (gfr: 121 +/- 4 vs. 111 +/- 4 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.001; rpf: 634 +/- 29 vs. 559 +/- 26 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.001; theta alb: 19.5 +/- 3.1 vs. 10.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(-7), p less than 0.01; theta igg: 11.6 +/- 3.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.7 x 10(-7), p less than 0.05).
