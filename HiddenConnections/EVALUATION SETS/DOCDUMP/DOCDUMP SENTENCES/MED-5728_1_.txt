because excessive iron can induce oxidative stress subsequently causing degradation of nigral dopaminergic neurons in pd, we determined the protective effect of a naturally occurring iron chelator, phytic acid (ip6), on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp(+))-induced cell death in immortalized rat mesencephalic/dopaminergic cells.
