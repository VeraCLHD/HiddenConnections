although some emerging swine viruses such as swine hepatitis e virus (swine hev), porcine endogenous retrovirus (perv) and porcine sapovirus (porcine sav) may have a limited clinical implication in swine health, they do pose a potential public health concern in humans due to zoonotic (swine hev) or potential zoonotic (porcine sav) and xenozoonotic (perv, plhv) risks.
