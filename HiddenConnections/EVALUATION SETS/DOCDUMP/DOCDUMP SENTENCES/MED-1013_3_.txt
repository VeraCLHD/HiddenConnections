using simple analogies (although turning gerontology upside down), this article discusses the origin of aging, how overactivation of the mtor (target of rapamycin) pathway causes aging, why aging causes damage (organ damage) not damage causes aging, the link between aging and age-related diseases, slow aging versus aging tolerance and suppression of aging with rapamycin.
