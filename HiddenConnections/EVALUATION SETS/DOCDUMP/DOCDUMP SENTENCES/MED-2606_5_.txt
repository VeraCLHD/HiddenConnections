other possible mechanisms implicated in the effect of statins on new-onset diabetes are: statin interference with intracellular insulin signal transduction pathways via inhibition of necessary phosphorylation events and reduction of small gtpase action; inhibition of adipocyte differentiation leading to decreased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma and ccaat/enhancer-binding protein which are important pathways for glucose homeostasis; decreased leptin causing inhibition of Î²-cells proliferation and insulin secretion; and diminished adiponectin levels.
