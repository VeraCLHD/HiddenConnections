methods: we treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with insulin (10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/l) for 0 to 24 h. to dissect potentially implicated signal transduction pathways, we treated endothelial cells with known pharmacological inhibitors of two distinct insulin signalling pathways: the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (pi3'-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin (3 x 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l), involved in insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase stimulation, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein (p38map) kinase inhibitor sb-203580 (10(-7) to 2 x 10(-6) mol/l).
