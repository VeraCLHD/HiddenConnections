meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt v usual salt) was -75 mmol/24 h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/day salt), and with this reduction in salt intake, the mean change in blood pressure was -4.18 mm hg (95% confidence interval -5.18 to -3.18, i(2)=75%) for systolic blood pressure and -2.06 mm hg (-2.67 to -1.45, i(2)=68%) for diastolic blood pressure.
