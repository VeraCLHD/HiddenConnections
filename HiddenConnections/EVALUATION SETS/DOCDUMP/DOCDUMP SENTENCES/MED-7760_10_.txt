in addition, higher bpa concentrations were associated with clinically abnormal concentrations of the liver enzymes gamma-glutamyltransferase (or per 1-sd increase in bpa concentration, 1.29; 95% ci, 1.14-1.46; p < .001) and alkaline phosphatase (or per 1-sd increase in bpa concentration, 1.48; 95% ci, 1.18-1.85; p = .002).
