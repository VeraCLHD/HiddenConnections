diets including prebiotics, green tea extract, or increased concentrations of protein have been shown to modify the expression of several genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose [e.g., uncoupling protein-2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, pparα, lipoprotein lipase (lpl), and glucose transporter 4] and skeletal muscle (e.g., pparα and lpl) tissues.
