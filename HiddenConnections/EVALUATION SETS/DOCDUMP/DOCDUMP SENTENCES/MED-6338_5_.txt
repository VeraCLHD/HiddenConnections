in the case of micronuclei analysis, no significant (p=0,06) difference between both groups was found, but these data should be cautiously interpreted since an increase in the frequencies of mn was found for radiation workers (3.0 mn/100 cells), compared to the control group (2.6 mn/100 cells) and this increase occur in parallel to ca and sce frequencies.
