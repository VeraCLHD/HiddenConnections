using human exercise and cellular models we found that 1) blackcurrant supplementation suppressed exercise-induced oxidative stress, e.g., plasma carbonyls (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg protein, placebo vs. blackcurrant), and 2) preincubation of thp-1 cells with an anthocyanin-rich blackcurrant extract inhibited lps-stimulated cytokine secretion [tnf-alpha (16,453 +/- 322 vs. 10,941 +/- 82 pg/ml, control vs. extract, p < 0.05) and il-6 (476 +/- 14 vs. 326 +/- 32 pg/ml, control vs. extract, p < 0.05)] and nf-kappab activation.
