compared with the volume and turnover of the bwp computed with the slope-intercept method (60.7 ± 4.1% body mass or 72.7 ± 3.2% lean body mass; turnover 4.58 ± 0.80 l day−1: i.e., complete renewal in ~50 days; n = 36), the values were accurately estimated with the n-cm and 1-cm and were slightly overestimated and underestimated, respectively, with the 2-cm (~7–8% difference, significant for water clearance only).
