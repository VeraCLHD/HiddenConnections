sirt1 mrna and its translated protein correlated negatively with the duration of symptoms (mrna: r2 = −0.367; protein: r2 = −0.326) and the accumulation of paired helical filament tau (mrna: r2 = −0.230; protein: r2 = −0.119), but weakly with insoluble amyloid-β(aβ42 (mrna: r2 = −0.090; protein: r2 = −0.072).
