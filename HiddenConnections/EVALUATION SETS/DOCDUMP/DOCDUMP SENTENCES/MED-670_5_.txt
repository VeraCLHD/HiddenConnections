the odds ratios for the two factors - children consuming more than 200 ml of cows milk per day (25 children in group i, 11 children in group ii) and breastfeeding for less than 4 months (16 children in group i, 5 children in group ii) - were calculated to be 8.6 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.23-0.74, p = 0.0005) and 5.7 (95% ci: 0.37-0.66, p = 0.007), respectively.
