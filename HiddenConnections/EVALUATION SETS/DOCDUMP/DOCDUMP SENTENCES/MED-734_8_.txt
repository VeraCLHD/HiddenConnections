rictor expression was significantly higher in background breast tissues compared with tumours and was inversely related to the nottingham prognostic index (npi1 vs. 2, p=0.03) and tumour grade (grade 1 vs. 3, p=0.01) and was associated with better overall (p=0.037) and disease-free survival (p=0.048).
