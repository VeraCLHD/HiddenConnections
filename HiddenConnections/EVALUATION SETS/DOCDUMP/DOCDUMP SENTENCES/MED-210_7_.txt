with adjustment for potential confounders (age, education, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, energy, carbohydrate and saturated fat intake, and history of diabetes or other chronic disease), the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for obesity were 4.62 (2.68â€“7.98, p for trend<0.01) for participants in the highest compared to the lowest quartile of animal protein and 0.58 (0.36, 0.95, p for trend=0.053) for those in the highest quartile of vegetable protein intake.
