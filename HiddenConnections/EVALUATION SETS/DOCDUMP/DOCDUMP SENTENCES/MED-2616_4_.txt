addition of purified bmp-2 protein did not increase the upregulation of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin secretion by piceatannol, whereas the bmp-2 antagonist noggin blocked piceatannol and bmp-2-mediated alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteocalcin secretion enhancement, indicating that bmp-2 production is required in piceatannol-mediated osteoblast maturation and differentiation.
