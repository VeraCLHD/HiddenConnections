exploratory analyses demonstrated that glucose values 2 h after a 75 gm glucose challenge were significantly lower at week 12 compared with baseline values in the hsg group (-1.13 ± 2.58 mmol/l, p = 0.02), and a similar trend was noted in the rsg group (-0.77 ± 2.07 mmol/l, p = 0.06), while no significant change was seen in the dcg group (-0.15 ± 2.27 mmol/l, p = 0.530).
