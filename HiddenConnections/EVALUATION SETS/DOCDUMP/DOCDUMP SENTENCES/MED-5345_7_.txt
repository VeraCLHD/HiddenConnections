the pooled multivariate hazard ratios for death among participants who ate nuts, as compared with those who did not, were 0.93 (95% confidence interval [ci], 0.90 to 0.96) for the consumption of nuts less than once per week, 0.89 (95% ci, 0.86 to 0.93) for once per week, 0.87 (95% ci, 0.83 to 0.90) for two to four times per week, 0.85 (95% ci, 0.79 to 0.91) for five or six times per week, and 0.80 (95% ci, 0.73 to 0.86) for seven or more times per week (p<0.001 for trend).
