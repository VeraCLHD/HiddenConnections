for all patients combined, serum tg increased significantly (p < 0.01) in the non-oa group with the median change from baseline to 170.0 mg/dl, compared to 21.5 mg/dl in the oa group during the 6 hours following the meal.conclusions: a single olestra meal significantly diminishes post prandial serum tg levels and improves myocardial perfusion in patients with endothelial disease.
