total cholesterol was inversely associated with all-cancer incidence in both men (hr, 0.84; 95% ci, 0.81 to 0.86; p trend < .001) and women (hr, 0.91; 95% ci, 0.87 to 0.95; p trend < .001), but these associations were attenuated after excluding incident liver cancers (men: hr, 0.95; p trend < .001; women: hr, 0.98; p trend = .32).
