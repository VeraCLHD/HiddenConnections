following multivariable adjustment within-twin pairs, significant influences on adiponectin (log-transformed, percent change per sd of the dietary/body composition variable) were observed for nonstarch polysaccharides (3.25%; 95% ci: 0.06, 6.54; p < 0.05) and magnesium intake (3.80%; 95%ci: 0.17, 7.57; p < 0.05), with a trend toward an association for fruit and vegetable (f&v) intakes (2.55%; 95% ci: -0.26, 5.45; p = 0.08).
