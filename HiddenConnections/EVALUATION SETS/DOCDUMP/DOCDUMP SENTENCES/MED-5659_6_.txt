after confounder adjustment, regression coefficients showed that cpt-rt outcomes differed in their associations with exposure biomarkers of prenatal methylmercury exposure: during the first two minutes, the average hrt was weakly associated with methylmercury (beta (se) for a ten-fold increase in exposure, (3.41 (2.06)), was strongly for the 3-to-6 minute interval (6.10 (2.18)), and the strongest during 7â€“10 minutes after test initiation (7.64 (2.39)).
