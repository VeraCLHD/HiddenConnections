this study sought to investigate the effect of some citrus peels' [grapefruit (citrus paradisii), orange (citrus sinensis) and shaddock (citrus maxima)] extracts on matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) and proteasome activities in primary human colonic tumor (caco-2) and the metastatic cell lines (lovo and lovo/adr) in a bid to explain the possible mechanism by which the peels could manage/prevent colon cancer.
