results: cinnamon ingestion reduced total plasma glucose responses (auc) to oral glucose ingestion [-13% and -10% for ogtt(cin) (p < 0.05) and ogtt(cin12hpre) (p < 0.05), respectively], as well as improving insulin sensitivity as assessed by insulin sensitivity index measures based on matsuda's model in both ogtt(cin) (p < 0.05) and ogtt(cin12hpre) (p < 0.05) trials compared with ogtt(control).
