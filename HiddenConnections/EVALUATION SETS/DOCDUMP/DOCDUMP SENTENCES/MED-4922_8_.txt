studies of the mechanisms of this putative elevation of harmane in et have explored the role of increased dietary consumption, finding weak evidence of increased exogenous intake in male et cases, and other studies have found initial evidence that the elevated harmane in et might be due to a hereditarily reduced capacity to metabolize harmane to harmine (7-methoxy-1-methyl-9h-pyrido[3,4-Î²]-indole).
