abstract induction of phase 2 detoxication enzymes [e.g., glutathione transferases, epoxide hydrolase, nad(p)h: quinone reductase, and glucuronosyltransferases] is a powerful strategy for achieving protection against carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and other forms of toxicity of electrophiles and reactive forms of oxygen.
