fetal aortas from hypercholesterolemic mothers and mothers with temporary hypercholesterolemia contained significantly more and larger lesions (758,651+/-87,449 and 451,255+/-37,448 micron2 per section, respectively; mean+/-sd) than aortas from normocholesterolemic mothers (61,862+/-9,555 micron2; p < 0.00005).
