to validate this further, we compared colonic contents from healthy 50- to 65-y-old people from populations with high and low risk, specifically low risk native africans (cancer incidence <1:100,000; n = 17), high risk african americans (risk 65:100,000; n = 17), and caucasian americans (risk 50:100,000; n = 18).
