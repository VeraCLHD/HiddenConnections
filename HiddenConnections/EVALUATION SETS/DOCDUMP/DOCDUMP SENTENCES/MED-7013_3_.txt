results: vegetarians had a 12% higher abundance of bacterial dna than omnivores, a tendency for less clostridium cluster iv (31.86 +/- 17.00%; 36.64 +/- 14.22%) and higher abundance of bacteroides (23.93 +/- 10.35%; 21.26 +/- 8.05%), which were not significant due to high interindividual variations.
