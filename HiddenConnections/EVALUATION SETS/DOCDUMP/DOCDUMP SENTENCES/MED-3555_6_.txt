we observed that plasma dhba (p = 0.007; p = 0.03), plasma dhppa (p = 0.02; p = 0.01), urinary dhba (p = 0.001; p = 0.003), urinary dhppa (p = 0.001; p = 0.001), and cereal fiber intake (p = 0.007; p = 0.003) were significantly lower in the bc group compared to the vegetarian and omnivore groups, respectively.
