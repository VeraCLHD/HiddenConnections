the objectives of the present study were to: (i) assess the correlation between intake of beverages containing excess free fructose (eff beverages) and asthma in children; and (ii) epidemiologically test the mechanistic hypothesis that intake of high eff beverages, such as apple juice or beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, is associated with increased risk of asthma.
