we found that massage activated the mechanotransduction signaling pathways focal adhesion kinase (fak) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2), potentiated mitochondrial biogenesis signaling [nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (pgc-1α)], and mitigated the rise in nuclear factor κb (nfκb) (p65) nuclear accumulation caused by exercise-induced muscle trauma.
