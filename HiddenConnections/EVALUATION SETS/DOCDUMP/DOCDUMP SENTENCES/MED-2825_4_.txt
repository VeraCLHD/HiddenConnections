data from 23 cohort studies and 2 follow-up studies of rcts (n = 274,683) showed that the risks of acm and cvdes were decreased in usual sodium vs. low sodium intake (acm: hr = 0.91, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.82-0.99; cvdes: hr = 0.90, 95% ci = 0.82-0.99) and increased in high sodium vs. usual sodium intake (acm: hr = 1.16, 95% ci = 1.03-1.30; cvdes: hr = 1.12, 95% ci = 1.02-1.24).
