this conclusion is supported by the following evidence: (1) epidemiologic studies linking vascular risk factors to cerebrovascular pathology that can set in motion metabolic, neurodegenerative, and cognitive changes in alzheimer brains; (2) evidence that ad and vascular dementia (vad) share many similar risk factors; (3) evidence that pharmacotherapy that improves cerebrovascular insufficiency also improves ad symptoms; (4) evidence that preclinical detection of potential ad is possible from direct or indirect regional cerebral perfusion measurements; (5) evidence of overlapping clinical symptoms in ad and vad; (6) evidence of parallel cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathology in ad and vad; (7) evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion can trigger hypometabolic, cognitive, and degenerative changes; and (8) evidence that ad clinical symptoms arise from cerebromicrovascular pathology.
