the predimed study took thousands of people at high risk for heart disease in spain, who were already eating a mediterranean-ish diet, and randomized them into three groups for a couple years, one with added extra virgin olive oil, one with added nuts, and a third group that was told to cut down on fat, but they didnâ€™t; so, basically ended up as a no dietary changes control group.
