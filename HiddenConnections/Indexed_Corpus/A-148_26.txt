a similar study on health behaviors and survival, highlighted in my video, turning the clock back 14 years, didn’t just take people’s word for how healthfully they were eating, they measured the level of vitamin c in people’s blood, a biomarker for how many plants they were eating, and the drop in mortality risk in those nailing all healthy behaviors was equivalent to being 14 years younger.
