organochlorine pesticides tend to build up in animal fat (see for example, cannibalistic feed biomagnification, avoiding other banned pesticides, and industrial carcinogens in animal fat) so we tend to think of meat, eggs, and dairy as being the most heavily contaminated, but there are concerning levels found in some plant foods too.
