to recap, the traditional model of how fruits and vegetables protect against cancer is that their antioxidants prevent the buildup of free radicals (also known as reactive oxygen species, ros) which would otherwise go on to damage our cellular dna, membranes, etc.—which could lead to the transformation of healthy cells into damaged, diseased, or dying cells.
