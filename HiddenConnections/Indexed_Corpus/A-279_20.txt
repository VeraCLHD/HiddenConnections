other benefits of increased fiber intake may include improved bowel function (bristol stool scale) and frequency (prunes vs. metamucil vs. vegan diet), lower colorectal cancer risk (stool size matters), lower breast cancer risk (relieving yourself of excess estrogen and fiber vs. breast cancer), lower blood pressure (whole grains may work as well as drugs), lower blood cholesterol (how fiber lowers cholesterol), weight loss (beans and the second meal effect) and a longer lifespan (what women should eat to live longer).
