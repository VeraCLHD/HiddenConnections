so, one could argue that the first remission was spontaneous, and it was just a coincidence that it happened when they started the vitamin c, but given the trajectory the cancer was on, followed by the rapid remission, followed by the relapse when the vitamin c was stopped, followed by a second remission once restarted does strongly suggest the vitamin c had something to do with it.
