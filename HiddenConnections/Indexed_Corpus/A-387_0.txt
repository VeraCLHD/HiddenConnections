consumer reports recently released a study in which they analyzed u.s. retail pork and found trace levels of an adrenaline-like drug called ractopamine in about 20 percent of the samples and a foodborne bacteria that sickens nearly 100,000 americans every year called yersina in two-thirds of pork samples.
