i start with the 12,000 or so papers published annually on human nutrition and, thanks to a crack team of volunteers, am able to whittle those down to about 3,000 studies, which are downloaded, read, analyzed, and churned into a few hundred short videos so i can post a new video every day, year-round, to nutritionfacts.org.
