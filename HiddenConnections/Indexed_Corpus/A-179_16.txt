for example, before starting someone at moderate risk on a cholesterol-lowering statin drug, a physician might ideally say something like: â€œyou should know that for folks in your situation, the number of individuals who must be treated with a statin to prevent one death from a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke is generally between 60 and 100, which means that if i treated 60 people in your situation, 1 would benefit and 59 would not.
