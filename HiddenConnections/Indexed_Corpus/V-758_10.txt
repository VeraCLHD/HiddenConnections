you’ll note, though, many of these 25 studies were funded by industry groups, such as the itnc-nref, the international tree nut council nutrition research and education foundation, or the international nut and dried fruit foundation, presumably throwing in the dried fruit part so they wouldn’t have to be known as the “international nut foundation.”
