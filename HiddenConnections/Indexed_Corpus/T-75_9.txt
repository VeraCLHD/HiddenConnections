the u.s. government does exercise some control over the egg industry’s ability to mislead the public about their product via the usda advertising regulations; if egg companies wish to use american egg board funds to create advertisements, they are legally not allowed to use the words: “healthy,” “nutritious,” “healthful,” “good for you,” “safe,” “part of a healthy diet,” or “a good source of protein, lutein, folate, omega 3’s, or iron.”
