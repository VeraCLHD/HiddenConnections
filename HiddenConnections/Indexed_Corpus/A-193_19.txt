if you’d rather just watch all the videos online as they launch, but would still like to support my work of helping to educate millions about healthy eating, you can make a tax-deductible donation to my 501c3 nonprofit organization nutritionfacts.org using a credit card, a direct paypal link, or by sending a check to “nutritionfacts.org” po box 11400, takoma park, md 20913.
