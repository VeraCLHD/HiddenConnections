low intake of dha doesnâ€™t necessarily equate with fetal dha inadequacy, but these new data suggest that some infants may not be getting enough and could benefit from their moms supplementing; and so, i recommend pregnant and breast-feeding women on plant-based diets do follow the consensus guidelines to get about 200mg of preformed dha from an uncontaminated source, like algae oil, which is probably the best combination for all women given the state of our world, to minimize exposure to toxic pollutants such as dioxins, pcbs, and mercury.
