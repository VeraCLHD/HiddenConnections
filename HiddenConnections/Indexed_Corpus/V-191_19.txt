in the original study, they started out infusing ten grams of vitamin c a day intravenously, whereas in both of the mayo studies designed to replicate the protocol, they just gave people vitamin c supplements to take orally—just sent them home to swallow 20 capsules a day—same dose, but ten grams given orally is not the same thing as ten grams given iv, something that wasn’t discovered until decades later.
